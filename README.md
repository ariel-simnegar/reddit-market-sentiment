# Reddit Market Sentiment

The [WallStreetBets Reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) is a place for day traders to post their risky options plays, revel over their winnings, and meme over their losses. Before each weekday, tens of thousands of forum members discuss their day trading predictions and strategies in a thread titled "What Are Your Moves Tomorrow". This project will use natural language processing techniques to see how well the forum's sentiment before each weekday predicts the prices of the forum's favorite securities.

**Warning: The scraped comments from "What Are Your Moves Tomorrow" threads can be viewed in the `data` directory, but be aware that WallStreetBets forum members express themselves as freely as anyone with anonymity on the Internet.**
