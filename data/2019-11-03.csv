Future you is going to hate present you for playing the options lottery. 98% of retail traders lose money. Shits far harder than it looks and if you want to make 5k you better be comfortable with lots of days where you come close to losing the 20k you invested to make it.

Put your money into ETFs and walk away. Or give yourself a lottery ticket budget for FDs. dont become a daytrader hacking the system like GUH boy did. Or think TA will tell you when to buy and sell well enough to profit. It only ends poorly."
