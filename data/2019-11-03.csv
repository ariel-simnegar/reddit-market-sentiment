Last Friday was already a nightmare ($20k loss) and with /ES at 3082.5 it's only getting worse (another $20k loss as it stands). 

I thought it was a smart idea to write call credit spreads when SPX was at ATH (3020 > which seems really far away now lol). Rolled them out and up 2 times, but they're ITM, again. Will roll them again, until SPX drops like crazy, or I run out of money, whichever comes first...."

2019-11-03 21:24:21,DeMayon,12,"So I posted this three days ago, and so far so good, GDXJ ended strongly Friday.

**AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:** all of the gold companies are reporting earnings this week...gold has been on a steady climb. This quarter is going to PRINT for the components of GDX and GDXJ. Also, the DXY is super weak as of right now. It seems like it will breach 97...this week looks VERY GOOD for gold

Copy pasted:


I've got the TA on GDXJ (Junior gold miners) but the same logic can be applied to /GC futures and GLD as a whole because they trade together.

Lets get into it:

Recently, we received the FOMC news that the FED cut rates three times in a row. The dollar, soon after, tanked and gold has a fresh breath of air. It has a reason to rally - global banks all over the world are cutting rates in lieu of facing a recession. They want to do QE? That's fine with me, gold will continue to breakout as long as the government deflates the dollar and safe havens like precious metals and bonds keep getting bought up.

So, from a macro perspective, gold has plenty of reasons to run. It has hit all-time-highs in EVERY major currency except for the USD.

As debt increases, gold becomes substantially more attractive. https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Debt.png The global flat currencies will keep declining...gold will keep rising.
