Whats going on recently? FED cutting rates at all time highs, USA is selling billions in weapons to Aisha descendant saudi kings, QE is now called Not QE, none of those ARAMCO shares are being sold in the USA, saudis own 5% of most USA S&P500 companies, including the bank that got the biggest bailout and now owns the most SPY shares.

everything makes sense when you realize the economic treason of rockefeller and jp morgan made the usa lose wwi and its citizens became subservient to kings again. just look at the unconstitutional stuff that happens in 1913-1914: income taxes, federal reserve, federal ban on drug use, federal ban on prostitution, later in decade protesting of wwi is banned and  biofuels are banned.

2019-12-02 06:23:17,uninfinity,11,"***Fed is reportedly considering a new rule to permit inflation to run above its 2% target to avoid entrenching rigid inflations which consistently undershoots the target***

*Translation IMO*: 

Fed set the 2% target inflation rate back in 2012 as that was considered as a safe/sweet spot to keep economy in a good state. They are now considering raising that 2% ceiling so the new policy can wait before inflation hits higher than 2%. 

So basically, Fed wants to prevent deflation at any cost and thus allowing higher inflation % in future, so they can be less aggressive with rate cuts in near future but at the same time this will allow them to cut rates even more if/when the inflation exceeds over 2.5% or 3%(whatever the new ceiling will be)."
