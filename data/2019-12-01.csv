everything makes sense when you realize the economic treason of rockefeller and jp morgan made the usa lose wwi and its citizens became subservient to kings again. just look at the unconstitutional stuff that happens in 1913-1914: income taxes, federal reserve, federal ban on drug use, federal ban on prostitution, later in decade protesting of wwi is banned and  biofuels are banned.

*Translation IMO*: 

Fed set the 2% target inflation rate back in 2012 as that was considered as a safe/sweet spot to keep economy in a good state. They are now considering raising that 2% ceiling so the new policy can wait before inflation hits higher than 2%. 

So basically, Fed wants to prevent deflation at any cost and thus allowing higher inflation % in future, so they can be less aggressive with rate cuts in near future but at the same time this will allow them to cut rates even more if/when the inflation exceeds over 2.5% or 3%(whatever the new ceiling will be)."

* China big mad about HK bill, but both sides still expect a deal to occur. But they say year end at the earliest and possibly not until after the Chinese New Year, which is late January.
* According to the anonymous source ""close to Trump's team"", Trump **is expected to delay the 12/15 tariffs** ***again***.  **This would be why futures are green.** Because the deal is still on the table and if this rumor is true it signals that mango is too much of a bitch to add additional tariffs ever again. If true, it basically confirms that the 12/15 tariffs were a bluff that China is calling successfully.
* Still no agreement on how many tariffs to roll back.
* Still no agreement on the amount of agricultural purchases.
* Still no agreement on the signing location. U.S. sources are still pushing strongly for an American signing location such as Iowa.

lol so they have no agreement or consensus on most things, after months of negotiation. But as long as 12/15 tariffs are not expected to happen, and as long as phase 1 deal is expected to happen *someday*, the stock market will remain complacent about the trade war. Bears' best hope is that the source is wrong about a tariff delay, or that between now and then mango gets pissed with how the talks are going and pulls the trigger. I have some 12/31 SPY puts and some 3/20/20 SPY puts... definitely thinking about cutting my losses for the 12/31 expiration ones."
