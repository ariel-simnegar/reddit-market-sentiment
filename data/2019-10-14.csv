My year long contract was coming to an end and they offered me a shit salad of a new deal to sign that would allow me to work as a temp indefinitely. It was so bad I instantly handed back the offer to the temp agency rep. 

He looked at me straight in the eyes with a smile and said, “isn’t it great?!” Thinking I was cool with it. 

I looked bad and had to hold back laughter as I said no... he pulled me into a small room to talk to me. Basically told the fucker I’d only sign if they gave me like a 40 percent raise.

Obviously they didn’t so I didn’t sign. Then 2 days later my manager comes to tell me if I don’t sign I can’t come into work on Monday since my old contract would be canceled. I quit submit me resignation 2 hours later that day since I wasn’t gonna sign. 

3 months later I get an job that paid me over double with actual Benefits."

JPM provided roughly $6B in debt financing and $3B to underwrite WeWorks IPO, they also directly provided Neumann with ~$100M in loans and opened a direct line of credit of $500M. WeWork going down has JPM looking at a loss of roughly $12.6B.


JPM was also the lead underwriter of the LYFT and more importantly SmileDirect IPO, which is now facing lawsuits for evading the FDAs prescription requirements for dental alignment products.


In short JPM is in hot water.


Edit: Again also rumored that JPM is the bank that caused the Fed to enter the repo market."

How can anyone take this deal seriously?

Donald J. Trump, POTUS, most powerful man in the free world, has enough free time meet with a VICE premier for a “deal” meanwhile Emperor Xi is not even phone calling?

Diving in deeper, what does it mean that a president is dealing with a flunky and not his equivalent in these high level discussions? Lulwut? 

I think Xi no longer holds one iota of respect for Trump after their fiasco at G20, and especially after that fake phone call. 

“Wait” holds a new meaning the moar I speculate. 

China is waiting for the next POTUS.
