2020-09-08 10:21:37,nosalute,5,If TSLA does a -20% day this could be its last day. It still has to bleed 1 more week worth of gains to find a bottom
2020-09-08 10:21:14,eduardopazruiz,5,I might actually cancel my sell order at open for Tesla. Seeing how futures have been during the weekend. It goes from bigly down to green and I think near open we might be closer to green. I think we‚Äôre just in panic mode since some of us slept to green futures
