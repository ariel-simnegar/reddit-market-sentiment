The vicious cycle of mms recouping from their losses from selling calls to retail traders by buying more stocks will continue so long as Biden is not the president.

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far

I lifted myself to my perch on the matress drawing the comforter around my knees, careful not to disturb the significant figure casting shadows from the bedside lamp.  ""It's not looking great."" I narrated to myself, fumbling with a cigarette and pinching the bridge of my nose.  The figure stirred, creasing a page over and dropping a hefty book on the bedside table with hollow thud.  He lumbered over to face me as I stretched back beside him.  His enormous hand pawed at my cigarette each finger like a log and hair like moss between each knuckle. ""You worry too much"" he exhaled. My hand clutched his, drawing it to my lips. I breathed deeply from his fingertips, his arm resting on my skeletal frame. His hand lay still, meaty fingers curling in on themselves.  A single ""huh"" his belly laughed, casting tremors through the matress. My eyes swam up his ample face, from the rolling stubble, to the soft pink indentations left by his reading glasses, finally settling in the pools of his eyes, dilated by the darkness.  He locked my gaze, letting out a hesitant smile and cautiously asked of me ""Fist on chest?"" I smirked. My heartbeat slowed and I could now hear the sound of crickets outside the bedroom window. I snuggled around his outstretched limb and settled further into the blanket whispering my reply. ""No fear."" And once again, the smile lingering as my eyes slowly drew shut. ""No fear.""

In March 2000, X.com merged with Confinity, its fiercest competitor, the new company being called X.com. Musk was its biggest shareholder and was appointed as its CEO. Also started in 1999, Confinity's product PayPal enabled users having Palm Pilots to send money to each other through its infrared ports. Subsequently, PayPal developed to allow users to send money using email and the web.  
  
In October 2000 Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Confinity. In June 2001, X.com was renamed PayPal.[4]

On 5 July 2017, Musk repurchased the domain name X.com from PayPal.[5][6] He explained later that he bought the website because ""it has great sentimental value"".[7]  
  
On 14 July 2017, X.com was launched again, consisting of a blank white page with one ""x"" in the top left corner,[8] and a custom error page displaying a ""y"".[9][10] The site displays this way due to having nothing in its source code except the single letter ""x"". In December, X.com redirected visitors to The Boring Company's website, which Musk also owns. This was done in order to advertise a hat sale.[10]  
  
X.com no longer redirects to The Boring Company, having reverted to the previous state of the blank page with one ""x"" in the top left corner. Subpages redirect to a blank page with a ""y"" in the same corner."

Write 2 CSPs of $128p 9/18 TQQQ at $6.80. Bank -> $1360 (Requires about $25,600 principal not counting premium from options)  
Continue to sell 1 week 8% OTM CSPs until 10/16. Assuming same premiums, total gain of $6800.  
Hedge with 46 contracts of $8c 10/16 on SPXS at $0.24. Cost -> $1104.  
If CSPs get assigned and market completely tanks, SPXS could easily 2.5x (this happened in March). Current price is 5.62 \* 2 (for buffer) = 11.24. Intrinsic value of options would be $5.62 then, for a total of $25,852 which would replace loss if TQQQ blew up to zero. The hedge is 16.2% of the premium from the puts.

Net gain for 5 weeks is $5,696 or 22.25% of principal. (Now, compound that every 5 weeks)"

I feel that tomorrow is a rug pull by afternoon. The leaks of Softbank making 4B on their options plays seems like a trial balloon so they can get out of their plays without other killer whales smelling blood in the water.

QQQ dropped 5% on Friday. That would seem like Softbank was cashing in their calls and big banks selling shares to be gamma neutral. I don't think the selling is over, since the nominal value of the 5B calls was leverage to something like 300B in market value.

Hence why I expect selling pressure in the afternoon, after a green opening than rug pull.

QQQ should drop 15%."

Well we are not good. TSLA S&P exclusion news comes out, shit drops and bam I wake up the next morning finding out I got assigned. So I'm long $408,000 tsla shares on margin with a net liq of like $40k. So um yeah, a wee bit of a matinence call.

I'm wondering do forced liquidations ever happen premarket? Or would it have to be when the market opens? The rep I talked to said hed try making a note on my account saying I intend to close by EOD Tuesday so I can maybe not be forced liquidated at a loss at open.
Anyways, close your spreads before market close on 0dte bois, don't be me.

How much growth do you think a cruise line can have? How many more passengers and what kind of innovations will make them worth more 10 years from now? Tech is ever evolving and is the future of man kind. Imagine how much we depended on tech 20 years ago vs now. Where do you think we'll be in 20, 30 or 40 years? Every industry which exists will eventually become ""techified"", other companies will start to stagnate. Yeah we'll have bumps along the way but if you think Delta Airlines will outperform Apple over the next 10 years you're a retard. We don't live in 2000, we now know how intertwined our lives are with tech and its future potential and applications.

Equities will moon into the trading day tomorrow, but if you have calls, take your profits as we will sell off either EOD or the trading session on Wednesday.

Enough FOMO to buy back in was created in this latest drop, but the dip will be gobbled up quickly leaving most risk on investors scratching their heads as we are right back to where we were last Wednesday.

We will be grinding (or crashing) lower though for the foreseeable future as China, Stimulus, Economic woes, and the presidential election bring massive uncertainty and the markets hate that. No better time to test Powell and the Fed and really see where they draw the line in regards to their put on the market.

3. Promise a zero emission (hydrogen, battery, supercapacitors, compressed air or whatever based) emerging tech.
4. Post some rendering on Twitter.
5. Promise nationwide refueling stations.
6. Go public via IPO or SPAC.
7. Sue the company you have been following/copying for something. Anything should work so that when people talk about the successful company, they also talk about your company.
8. Pump the stock price by claiming it would be 10-15 time within a matter of couple years.
9. After initial pumping, sell most of your share and buy a ranch and a private jet.
10. If someone say against your company block them in Twitter.
11. If the company fails after couple of years then go hibernation and repeat the whole process with some new hype tech."

Our team has been hard at work making improvements to our options offering and we would like to share some of them with you today. Many of the updates are already live in your app and we have even more coming soon. Here are some highlights:

We‚Äôve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app:¬†Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.

We‚Äôve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you‚Äôre in a short position due to an early assignment.

We‚Äôre making buying power easier to understand:¬†We've begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we‚Äôll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation.

We‚Äôre continuing to expand our options education resources:¬†You can read about¬†advanced options strategies¬†and topics like¬†early options assignments¬†in our Help Center right now, and we‚Äôll be adding more resources in the future.

If you have any questions or concerns about your Robinhood account, please¬†reach out to our support team. We‚Äôre here to help.

As always, thank you for being a Robinhood customer."

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.


 I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
