Oh, and a butterfly spread I got yesterday that lays out around 264 or so may hit if they straight sell off today. We shall see.

Or I may just say fuck it and ride the elevator up to 300.

I'll have to see what the volume is.  Price action is kind of meaningless with all this technical nonsense running the show.  Everyone and their mother can just read the fib chart and figure out what levels people are trying to hit.

Forgot two things, I also have really cheap otm BNO calls that I can sell to offset if Donald Pump manages to jump oil back up.  If I find a buyer.  I bought them so cheap they may still be too otm.

In comparison, it’s main competitor Lyft is just burning through cash. Rides is actually profitable. Millennials don’t even know what a taxi is anymore. Grubhub has shown that the food delivery businesses is profitable at scale and Uber is getting there. Of course profitability margins will be tight but there is a strong possibility of profit in the next 2 years. Investments like ATG are risky but could pay off big time. They have tons of data and are investing big in tech (much bigger than any of their rivals). I’m willing to place my bets. I don’t get why people write it off. The are far worse companies ATM . My thesis is that right now it is grossly undervalued."

Either extremely cautious longs or, my preference, cash gang is the way until we get closer to 290-300. At that point we're barely even in correction territory which is just plain scary given the reality. I think we'll realistically hover there for a bit, then volatility will start to increase and then the shoe will finally drop and we'll retest lows. Will prob start re-entering puts once we're above 290 and avg down if we climb higher and then just sit back for and watch as the $ flows in and (unfortunately) the world burns.

#The problem is there were 80 deaths in the town in the last 8 weeks. 

80 of 4800 is 1.7% mortality across ALL RESIDENTS. 

And still 30% haven't been infected. Let's say the population is old. Cut mortality in half. We're still right around 1%.

That translates to millions of deaths.

Looking at QQQ and SQQQ since Feb 19 will show you why it is a bad idea to hold for more than a few days, or at the most, weeks. QQQ is down 15% from that date. So you might think SQQQ should be up 45%, since it is a 3x inverse of QQQ. But it is actually down 1% right now since February 19. The big swings and volatility will fuck your gains. So if you want to trade them set a stop loss as soon as you buy, and set a price where you will sell, and stick to it."

Interesting takeaways:

- Open to close price change has beat 2019 biggest intraday move 18 times since Feb 19

- High/low spread has topped 2019 high 26 times...volatility is a hell of a drug.

- Volume has beat 2019 high 27 times.

- Consistent drop in volume the past 8 trading days.

- 3:50 dildo has been red 13 times and green 23 times. Although, I wouldn’t really say 3:50 dildo was a thing until Feb 27. It’s also been green every day the past 2 weeks except yesterday (covering shorts or pure bull?)

- Monday’s falling knife catch to the tune of $16+ (248.17 low to 264.86 close) is pretty fucking interesting. Also 3:50 5m green candle that only rose price $2...

1. Bad news that come out in the short term (more deaths, high unemployment) are already priced in. That's why SPY dropped 40% in two weeks. 

2. People who would have sold thinking that SPY is heading down to 200 have already sold at this point. 

3. There's so many people who are currently kicking themselves in the feet for missing the dip. This FOMO will make sure those people will buy every single dip for a while. 

What's going to make or break this situation is the length of the quarantine. If we don't open up again after May, we are gonna crash hard and actually enter into a recession where unemployment isn't just temporary."

a lizard walks past. The lizard looks up and says to the monkey “Hey! what are you doing?” The monkey says “Smoking a joint, come up and join me, my cold-blooded friend.”
So the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they have another joint. After a while the lizard says his mouth is ‘dry’, and that he’s going to get a drink from the river.
At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side.
He then asks the lizard, “What’s the matter with you?!” The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with his new monkey friend. He then explained how his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in!
The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. He looks up and says “Hey, MONKEY!” The Monkey looks down and says “FUUUUUCK, DUDE……. how much water did you drink?”

I think next week might be green or sideways. Feels like they’re trying to shake out all the 4/17 holders before pulling the rug. Although oil talks might change things of course. Who the fuck knows.

1. You are fighting the central banks/feds..they will not let this market fail. Volitility was your friend...its your worst enemy now...they are controling and designing the dip. Ever since 2008...much more tools were created to protect the market and you are seeing them now.

2. Your DD is not great. One thing it doesnt calculate is fear of the people. I can't even get a girl to come over due to straight fear. This will continue evem if the economy opens..wont be back to normal but it will open.People are social distancing much better than expected thus the virus will die if it cant spread. 

3. A crash will only happen if boomers sell and they arent selling..the  true bears that did already did at the first 30%...the nooby bears are the ones trying to catch the crash after the crash..as u can see people are investing on the fire sale.

4. There are over 300 TREATMENTS/VACCINES in the works. Only one needa approval for another 20% rise. Every fking scientist, billionaire is throwing money at the problem.

5. Summer is around the corner...virus tends to die down.  By fall we will be much more prepared.

6. The deaths you are seeing is before social distancing.

7. When all is said and done... the # of deaths will be less than or equal the yearly flu. 

8. The biggest key takeaway...this virus has been in the US since December...maybe eariler..I had in Jan.  So your acceleration theory most likely will be a deacceleration.

9. China. fking china..150 million masks PER day are being created by thousands of factories rallying to the cause of prevention and printing money in the form of masks. In 2 months...there will be over 9 billon masks...4 months..18 billion...there will be one gor every person if need."

MAJOR UPDATE

Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So as everyone knows, unless you live under a bridge, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Stock markets across the globe are in turmoil. People don’t know what to do with themselves.

Well, I bring good news.

In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.

The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.

This was found by a viewer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA

In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....

Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....

Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason 

I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you’ll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto
Your hat, it’s about to get crazy 

The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence. 

“Ok, I’ll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren’t available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.”

The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.

They proceed to follow Bart’s plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious “boss”.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don’t need to worry about that andn I don’t need to explain it....

But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.

America’s passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.

I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go
Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you’ve earned it."

It is a fact right now that most of the S&P volume is being driven by ETF buying right now when the APs buy up the underlying stocks to create shares. More than ever almost all stocks are rising and falling perfectly in rhythm proportional to that stocks weight in the index. 

The FED isn't just buying MBS and Treasuries. They are funneling cash through operations like Blackrock to buy the index directly.

As I said in the weekend thread from 4 days ago, I had MAR, UBER, LYFT, and CCL calls I got end of day last Friday as part of my weekly reversal trade (as well as AAL and LK shares)...but I got out of all of them middle of day yesterday except my AAL/LK shares (LK no way to get out of anyways).  Oh well, they still did really well this week (some like +500%), just coulda been even better with today's moves.

But now I reversed myself and am essentially short IWM (short call spreads), SPY (put spread), MCD (put spread), NFLX (short call spread), IQ (short calls), LYFT (now long put spread), SQ (short calls) and CLX (short stock).  IWM, SPY, and NFLX expire tomorrow, the other option positions expire next week, so I've turned myself into a bull into a semi-bear within the week.  I feel like I'm going to get screwed in IWM, SPY, and NFLX (with DIS news) for tomorrow, but it's fine, just trying out the bear experience.

I really think if you are looking for some good opportunities, if you can time the reversion again on stocks like CCL, MAR, UBER, LYFT, SHAK, SQ, etc. you can make a lot.  Like you can make 20x if you can time these right, way more than SPY.

I'm still long tech, JNJ, and COST though (but a decent amount is in shares) and will never change that, so I'll never be a full bear."

* We may ""sell the news"" re: oil deal at current point or go up to 282~284 tomorrow before selling.
* We trade flat till close to April 15~17 then start trending down. We likely don't hit the lows in April
* VIX will drop to near 41 levels and decimate my puts further, at which point I'll average down

It's very insightful the get a daily look into boomer thought processes alongside actual summary of what's going on. My takeaway from today is that individual investors/boomers are massively retarded. ""They don't want to miss what could be a generational investing opportunity"". That's their sentiment now that we've gone up over 20% from the bottom. A correction is not a generational investing opportunity you retards. They were shitting bricks at the bottom in March and now buying back in.

Expect this shit to hold up for some time. We need a Lehman moment for the big boys to pull the rug again. There's no panic on the short term horizon no matter the recession we're currently in. Bagholding and diamond handing puts won't work if your expiration isn't really far out. Either day trade or swing trade for now and have stop losses according to your personal risk tolerance.

You just gotta find the right stocks.  I also have a CLX short from Monday when SPY was much lower (see post below)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvwu06/daily\_discussion\_thread\_april\_06\_2020/fmlgo47/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvwu06/daily_discussion_thread_april_06_2020/fmlgo47/?context=3)

CLX has gone down since then (albeit only a bit), but it has done so despite SPY going up like 4% and my long tech all going up, so the pairs trade is working.

Anyways, just my 2 cents, you can still be short, but don't like yolo yourself into all SPY puts.  These short opportunites also change like every few days, so you just gotta know when to get out and switch to other puts."
