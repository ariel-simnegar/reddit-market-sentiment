Oh, and a butterfly spread I got yesterday that lays out around 264 or so may hit if they straight sell off today. We shall see.

Or I may just say fuck it and ride the elevator up to 300.

I'll have to see what the volume is.  Price action is kind of meaningless with all this technical nonsense running the show.  Everyone and their mother can just read the fib chart and figure out what levels people are trying to hit.

Forgot two things, I also have really cheap otm BNO calls that I can sell to offset if Donald Pump manages to jump oil back up.  If I find a buyer.  I bought them so cheap they may still be too otm.

Obviously it‚Äôs riced but I‚Äôm just wondering when I get all the good memes of the death of the printer."
