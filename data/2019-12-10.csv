2019-12-11 07:29:09,yayahi,14,"1. [legit coming from china directly](https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1202162573212209154) (this dude is the CPC's mouthpiece to US) and there isn't a single positive comment he's made about trade talk progression
2. Just historically, [escalations have always occurred during market tops](https://i1.wp.com/heisenbergreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MarketPeaksVsTradeDeescalationDB.png?w=615&ssl=1)
3. Market has been def buying into ""good"" news, but ignoring the ""fake"" news. I think this is largely due to the systematic inflow from algos/MMs given that gamma vs spot is net positive (if we drop lower, MMs well flip to net short and start selling, but above this point they will keep buying in- ES spot currently at 3080) BUT there is 0% reason to believe that the good news is more reliable than bad. So this market is def not pricing in a escalation on 15th.
4. Last time there was a delay in tarrifs, it was Dec 4 in 2018- well in advance of the planned tariff escalation to be done at the end of the year (by jan 1 2019)
5. [Kudlow coming in again](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kudlow-says-china-tariffs-still-on-table-for-dec-15-2019-12-10) to remind that ""dec 15 tariff' still on the table
6. Trump is known to be engineering the fed to lower rates via trade war escalations, which has resulted in net equity boost. It is very well known that he perfectly understands that descalation of the trade war will lead to a more hawkish fed which he does not want-  if he deescalates, [he losses leverage with the fed.](https://heisenbergreport.com/2019/10/25/will-trump-give-up-his-leverage-over-jerome-powell-to-secure-a-deal-with-xi/)

Im full bear, just like everyone. 

[But in all honesty this is what Im seeing in the elliot wave](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QIadURn2/) here at the moment in my unbiased and subjective lens, and fuck it hurts it really hurts.

So its a bit hard to see in that chart, but zoomed in we are midway wave 2 correction. of greater wave 5.

This means wave 3 is yet to come of said wave 5, taking us into those fucking gay levels there on the chart there.

We also have to finish this zig zag wave 2 which corresponds to a perfect drop to 3110 based on golden pocket fibs and trendbased extension of wave a for wave c in this correction ( not shown in this zoomed out chart) 

That would ALSO correspond perfectly to an initial bearish reaction to the FOMC announcement and subsequent BTFD for another few weeks yet. 

At least this is what my rudimentary butchered ameteur elliot wave analysis is telling me who someone would literally and figuratively need to be retarded to accept as investment advice."

No updates from the [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8g190/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_10/fac9rii/). Continued slight downward movement until we get news. Action today suggests that without news probably going to be filling the last gap up, so trending towards 312.4. That will be support and I don't expect any action below it without macro news.
