1- Europe Central Bank restricts travel for all its employees and yet, they tell markets that everything is okay, lol.

2- Business confidence regarding future activity was very low in February due to coronavirus

3- China car sales sank a record on 80% during February amid the virus outbreak

6- French Finance minister: Europe needs to boost government spending to protect its economy from the impact of coronavirus

7- UK service sector slows amid coronavirus worries. UK Services PMI down to **53.2** for February, from **53.9** in January

Yet, despite all of this, Germany is up with 1.32%, UK is up with 1.44%, NL is up with 1.13%.

Today may be theta gang day. However, if you loaded calls at the 297 level yesterday, you can probably cash in nice tendies today. If you bought puts there, you are dumb and are probably going to be underwater for a day or two until market decides to re-test the lows.

Medium term this is not over, but not every day is a drill day. Stonks sometimes go up too, even if they always go down.

Educated Wild Guess: Wednesday and Thursday nothing much happens, mostly sideways, maybe slightly up, with any major virus or earning news making dents.

The claim is that the US is fucked because it isn‚Äôt actually testing. I was skeptical because I thought sick people are being tested and there just aren‚Äôt that many sick people so there‚Äôs less testing. 

But something just doesn‚Äôt add up about these numbers. If the US has one of the better health care systems in the world, then why would the US have a 9% fatality rate when the rest of the world is at 2%?

I‚Äôm guessing you all are right and there are way more cases here than we know about. 

Which is real bad news if true.

Edit: just to clarify, I don‚Äôt mean the US health care system is one of the better ones in the world in terms of affordability and accessibility. Just in terms of education, resources, and sophistication. Many countries have excellent hospitals too, but compared with places like Iran, Italy, China, and Korea, it‚Äôs better in the US."

Maybe the American market flew to close to the Sun and like Icarus himself has began is fiery decent to earth.

Everything up here is boomer tier shit, I'm talking railroads, banks, oil, mining telecoms. There's litterally not even one tech company in Canada I don't think. I'm talking dividends bro, like banks with 6% yield. 

I'm not saying YOU should invest in Canadian equities, you should continue to throw your entire account on OTM FDs. 

I'm talking about all the funds, algos, old rich people who are buying bonds en masse for 1% yield. What are the chances they send that money up to the great white North? 

Think about it, it's still winter here, everybody is at home not spreading coronavirus. We are not densely populated like USA. Did you guys watch Contagion? I just did a couple nights ago, and I drank Corona's while I was at it. In the movie Canada is rarely mentioned, just like in real life, but it is implied that Canada faired much better. For example, USA ran out of bodybags and was trying to get some from Canada. 

Are we too connected to the American market or will the Great White North be the flight to safety?"

Age 10-19 = 0.2%

Age 20-29 = 0.2%

Age 30-39 = 0.2%

Age 40-49 = 0.4%

Age 50-59 = 1.3%

Age 60-69 = 3.6%

Age 70-79 = 8.0%

Age 80+ = 14.8%

So, if you are under 39 and catch this, you only have a 99.8% chance of living through it. This is more of a boomer problem than anything else.
