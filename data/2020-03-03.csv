1- Europe Central Bank restricts travel for all its employees and yet, they tell markets that everything is okay, lol.

2- Business confidence regarding future activity was very low in February due to coronavirus

3- China car sales sank a record on 80% during February amid the virus outbreak

4- China's service sector suffers record slump: [https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1235070728908787714](https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1235070728908787714)

5- World Bank pledges 12BN to fight coronavirus

6- French Finance minister: Europe needs to boost government spending to protect its economy from the impact of coronavirus

7- UK service sector slows amid coronavirus worries. UK Services PMI down to **53.2** for February, from **53.9** in January

Yet, despite all of this, Germany is up with 1.32%, UK is up with 1.44%, NL is up with 1.13%.
