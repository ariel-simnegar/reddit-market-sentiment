2020-01-16 09:22:14,digitalradiohead,6,No DD but think about it. If you were a money manager and missed the rally in Tesla and tried to buy it here and the stock kept going down you would have to explain to your clients that you were bearish on Tesla at 250 but bought it at 500 and were wrong twice. It needs to come in a lot before big buyers start coming in again.

2020-01-16 08:01:41,y7nx90,1,"Man that earnings page is a joke.  I was just taking a look because I wanted to see what other earnings could be off (since we are trying to guess TSLA).

It's off for ROKU, SQ, TWLO, and a ton of names.  It didn't even get the right week for those names.  SQ hasn't even announced but there is almost 0% chance (which is what the market is pricing too) it's on the week it lists it at in the link above.  ROKU and TWLO already announced and it isn't on the week it is listed.  BIIB also has the wrong date, even though that was announced like a month ago..."
