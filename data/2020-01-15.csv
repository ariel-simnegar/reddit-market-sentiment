2020-01-16 09:22:14,digitalradiohead,6,No DD but think about it. If you were a money manager and missed the rally in Tesla and tried to buy it here and the stock kept going down you would have to explain to your clients that you were bearish on Tesla at 250 but bought it at 500 and were wrong twice. It needs to come in a lot before big buyers start coming in again.

Been digging thru SEC files, apparently it’s changed names 5 times in the last 11 years to muddle it’s paper trail.  Loses all of its value then refreshes the name.  Huge secondary offerings too and this one hasn’t gotten one yet, but today’s pump feels like it’s primed for one.

Even juicier, Michael Brauser owns a good chunk of the company and was more deeply involved when it was prior names.  He colluded with John McAffee in years past and has been running pump and dump scams since the 80s.

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.
It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.
I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.
We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.
Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""
And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""
I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."" For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.
For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there."

Everything on that calendar is absolute dogshit that nobody cares about.

The market does not give a single fuck about all that garbage. Only boomers care about that shit.

The only thing the current market cares about is trade deals, rate cuts, and wars (barely).

I don't remember the last time economic numbers affected the market for more than a couple minutes.

So no - tomorrow's consumer numbers/PPI don't mean shit and you shouldn't care about what that trash even says."

If you open a long call calendar spread, and your short call expires OTM, then after that the stock value moves above the long call, could you potentially profit not only off of the theta decay from the spread, but then also from the increase of intrinsic value on the long call? So, for example, if I opened a SPY call calendar spread at a 330 strike with expiration on 1/17 on the short call and 1/24 on the long call, SPY doesn't hit 330 by EOD Friday (I know, blasphemy to bulls), but then it shoots above it on Monday, wouldn't that be like.. the perfect position for that play, and increase earnings potential to infinite? Or, is it NEVER a good idea to allow the short call to expire, and to always close it before then? Just curious."

Although I thought the trade deal would be a market mover, we're instead still trading [within the projected trendlines from the beginning of the week.](https://imgur.com/KeR4vrd) This may be due to the fact that most of the tariffs of the trade deal remain in place, though projections of the agricultural purchases are projected to increase US GDP in the future. 

As a result, this will be yet another day where I'll say the ranges are still relatively unchanged. 324.8 floor, 329 resistance. Retail sales are coming out tomorrow at market open and if we're being honest, the projections look absurdly high even for a historical basis, which suggests we may miss and could drive down the market.
