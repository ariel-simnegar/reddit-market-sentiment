Door buster deals like TV‚Äôs and appliances known to usually sell out were still on the floor. The only things that were selling out were small ticket items like Switch games and google Nest devices. Ring doorbells and cameras were also selling like hot cakes. Other than that, expect retailers to announce huge online traffic and move forward with e-commerce and exclusive online deals for 2020!"

If stock market tanks then the underlying economy will change going democrat.

I understand that the profit made by an option is the amount of money past the break-even point multiplied by 100, but is that only if I had enough buying power for 100 shares?
