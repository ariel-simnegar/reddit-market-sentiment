Door buster deals like TV‚Äôs and appliances known to usually sell out were still on the floor. The only things that were selling out were small ticket items like Switch games and google Nest devices. Ring doorbells and cameras were also selling like hot cakes. Other than that, expect retailers to announce huge online traffic and move forward with e-commerce and exclusive online deals for 2020!"

It‚Äôs a self funding Ponzi scheme and being extra funded by the fed if trade war ended it adds on another bonus but we only need 2 bonuses tops. If stock market tanks then the underlying economy will change going democrat. But if the stock market stays up while the underlying market dies beneath people will think that the Republican policies work great cause stocks I can‚Äôt invest in are up a ton so we‚Äôll probably get a lot of people moving out of the Midwest and into cities nearby

I understand that the profit made by an option is the amount of money past the break-even point multiplied by 100, but is that only if I had enough buying power for 100 shares? Because the profit from selling the option is only like $2 (it‚Äôs worth $17 now and I got it for $15).
