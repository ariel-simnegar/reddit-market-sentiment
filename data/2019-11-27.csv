Otherwise the bears will cheer until next Monday at least. 

I can imagine a tweet will come immediately  in the case of a 1-2% drop by Nasdaq or DJI. 

Trump is playing the game with China too.

With a potential deal in sight but never signed, the market will easily shrug off the negatives every time Trump tweets about “the deal is close “, “we are talking very well”, “China wants the deal more”, “ we will get the deal done soon”, “we are winning big” etc. 

Trump has clearly seen it and he is and will be enjoying the status quo I would say, at least until the election date.  He can manipulate the stock index easily by his tweets with the phase one deal pending forever."

"" Congress sent the bills to the president’s desk last week, after both chambers passed the legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support.

The first bill would require the State Department to certify once a year that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to retain its special U.S. trading consideration — a status that helps its economy. Under that designation, the city is not subject to the tariffs that have been levied on China. The bill also sets up the potential for sanctions on people responsible for human rights abuse in Hong Kong.

The second measure would bar the sale of munitions such as tear gas and rubber bullets to Hong Kong police."""
