>""The public health infrastructure and the response to outbreaks and the National Security Council have been gutted by this administration,"" Davidson said.

>Two years ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China, after the Trump administration refused to reallocate money to a program that started during the government's response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

>At that time, former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said the move ""would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.""

>Another factor involves the tests themselves — including malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability.

>In the first few weeks of coronavirus in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results.

That leaves about 330k beds available nationwide (perhaps a bit fewer this time of year with regular flu season, etc)

Let’s trust Italy’s numbers and assume that about 10% of cases are serious enough to require hospitalization. (Keep in mind that for many patients, hospitalization lasts for weeks — in other words, turnover will be very slow as beds fill with COVID19 patients)

By this estimate, by about May 8th, all open hospital beds in the US will be filled. (This says nothing, of course, about whether these beds are suitable for isolation of patients with a highly infectious virus.)

US is not geared for this at all. And imagine all the people not going to the hospital because of lack of insurance and money..."

I opened very high leverage short trade and if it goes down, I will profit more than my initial investment. For example, a 100$ trade up 300% to $300.

However, if it goes up and I will lose $100 maximum and the rest $200 will absorb by my broker.

&#x200B;

So my question is:

If I open two accounts with each $100 with the broker, and each of the accounts will have long and short with higher leverage. When the market opens, one of the accounts will profit a lot and the profit will ably cover my losses on the other account.

2020-03-13 06:39:45,BaunDorn,46,"VIX hit ridiculous levels today peaking at 76. This hasn't occurred since 2008. But we aren't even at a bottom yet, so it's too risky to keep holding 100% of your puts with diamond hands if you're a huge fund, bearish or not. If the VIX falls it causes whiplash in the market. Massive option positions are causing these swings due to negative gamma. I'm talking billions in options are trading, especially today.

I've been monitoring unusual option activity on SPY and also the $SPX where professionals hang out. Do you see how we almost held 251-252 end-of-day with voraciousness? If you analyze the option chains you'll see massive spikes in the value of options today when we went sub 255. When then VIX is near all-time highs at 76 and you just went 2x,3x,4x and even 10x on your puts you don't hold that. This is the time you've been waiting for. Your bet on volatility was right and you dump most of your puts.

Sub 255 we can see lots of thousands of puts being sold. Puts worth anywhere from $1,000 each to $30,000 in lots of 1,000 to 5,000. Those are funds who are long puts selling in transactions worth $50m - $150m. After a 10% down day, margin calls flushing out to 247, and every news headline screaming Black Monday 1987 with peak fear levels so far in 2020, we'll probably get a technical bounce tomorrow. I don't think it's a bottom because there's still a lot of negative news to come, but I'm not surprised to see a relief rally tomorrow and decent opportunity to gradually buy more puts if the VIX drops."

2020-03-13 05:21:24,Zachmode,12,"Hey new bears, welcome to a bear market.

This what it's like in a bear market. What we've all seen in the last month wasn't a bear market. It was a fearful drop where anyone that had ANY puts won. Before that it's was full on bullish where anyone that bought calls more than a week or 2 out made money.

Now we're in a bear market. Very very few people win here. This is why you see institutions like BRK (that are wayyy smarter and more experienced than you) go all cash. Lots of ups and downs from here on out until it stabilizes. I'm not talking about the usual pumps that do 3-4% green days once or twice a week. 

It's longer runs now, both up and down, from here on out, and exponentially harder to consistently make money. Good luck. 

This is what you all wanted right? Or did you think stonks draw a straight line to 0?"

# WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US

Fuck if I know, but I don't think the markets are gonna close for a day, week, or anything. Finance is opportunity and the game is fair and if it's not fair, its because the gov has their +4 draw card in the form of repos and trilllllions of buckerinos.

2. the covenants on the warehouse (small facility) have ""delinquency ratios"" for auto leases that are tested monthly and fail after 3 months
3. whilst I cannot find the agreement for the larger lease facility it is *possible* it has similar covenants - esp given 0.9b p.a. in leasing revenue, 48month lease terms = approx 3.6b total leasing
4. GFC saw material blow outs in auto loan defaults which should help smash these covenants.
5. cascading debt defaults in the middle of a credit crunch

= TLSA has exposure to auto default risk

6 months should be long enough to shake this out. (not an epic return but still nice)"

I bought vxx puts. Not FD's but prob further out the money than they should be. And I've had anxiety because I realized options on vxx are retarded unless you actually think you are going to get beyond break even at expiry. 

Vxx is essentially measuring fear and volatility, in other words, higher IV the higher the vxx. IV drives a lot of price movement in options so I got two scenarios. 

1. Volatility drops and I get closer to ITM but volatility Is going with it so my option premium, what i set out to trade, is hurting.

2. On the other hand if volatility increases, I'm getting a bit of IV surge, but the price is going further OTM.

I actually am going to dump this shit for whatever loss, gain, break even, at the fucking open. It's a lesson learned.

Someone smarter than me correct me"

Now we have Europoor as Rohan waking up to the virus after sleeping on it with the “it’s just a flu bro”. Last few days kinda felt like Helms Deep. Oh yeah the Arabs pulled a Saruman on us with their oil war.

So we might now get a Rohirrim charge aka dead cat bounce. After that the US or big company earnings are gonna get sieged hard. It all ends with a anticlimatic deus ex machina called a hot summer which will melt away the virus making it manageable. Then the vaccine companies finally roll out the vaccine.

2020-03-13 03:49:53,kodaxero,1,"So I'm kind of glad I didn't say anything about it two days ago when I was tempted to post but I knew about this ahead of time. I decided against posting on Tuesday that WHO was about to declare a global emergency but I've still had mixed feelings and I can't be easily identified at this point so I'll let you know now /pol/ that it's way worse than what you're being told. I'll preface this by saying I work in finance and have friends and family in the medical industry and field, including at CDC and one close friend at WHO.

For starters the Ro (pronounced R naught) is actually around 6, not 3. Secondly it's slightly more lethal in current form, with China covering up a LOT of the deaths by passing them off as heart attacks, pneumonia, kidney failure, all sorts of official causes to hide the real numbers. CDC and WHO are highly aware of this. You will also hear the phrase ""confirmed cases."" It's presently thought by epidemiologists that China surpassed 120,000 cases on Tuesday at the lowest; it is also possible they hit 100k over a week ago. All they know for sure is China definitely had at minimum 120,000 infections by Tuesday.

There are very high profile investors who've been silently pulling out ahead of time. Travel and tourism, the hospitality and service industries, these are just the most immediate and obvious. Manufacturing is about to go on a wild ride. The only ""safe"" industries to invest in right now are the biomedical fields and plastics oddly enough. Virtually all other industries are going to be massively hit and anybody in the know has been trying to do this as quietly as possible before SHTF partly to avoid insider trading allegations but more importantly to not start a panic.

This is also why CDC and WHO is hiding it. So far as they are concerned, no matter how bad the disease is, a panic is always going to be worse. This is also why a lot of economists are downplaying it or outright lying to you.

- outbreak of deaths that spook and make a scared consumer (market honestly doesn't about deaths in general)
- interstate travel bans

am i missing anything? maybe china/asia gets fucked round 2 as they try to open production and makes the supply side even worse.

If you didn’t see closely, today they gave $500 billion in a 3 month loan. And tomorrow will be $500 billion in a 3 month AND $500 billion in a 1 month operations. 

Unlike overnight 24 hour repos, banks have months before full repayment.  We don’t know when/how these banks will use their newfound liquidity but you can be sure that they know it’s in their best interest to swing the hell out of the market and profit.  Next few weeks will be choppy as hell.  We don’t even know if the pump we saw today was all 500 billion or just a taste.

The beer flu will continue to decimate the markets until late May-June. Continue to buy puts until then and you’re good (minus the random 6% up green dragon dildo days). In June our favorite baby company J&J will manufacture and produce the vaccine and will subsequently skyrocket in value. 

“But what about the year to two year clinical trials?” you ask. The vaccine is already here. A slight modification to a current vaccine will all but kill out the rona. The fed will expedite the release as the economy will be in the shitter by then. 

TLDR; buy 7/17 calls all the way up to 180. Literally every strike as much as you can afford. On July 1st shoot me a thank you pm.

Swine flu killed over ten thousands of Americans and we didn’t blink. We don’t quarantine people from driving cars even though they kill hundreds of thousands per year because we know that would destroy the economy. If we keep taking this strong of a approach to this thing I feel like we might literally walk right into a recession that was very avoidable. The economy cannot sustain these types of closures. We didn’t close schools for Swine Flu or cancel sports and that killed like over 10k Americans. Is it because our news is so present now we are freaking out now.

We are going to have a major, but temporary, disruption. There will be serious consequences. But now that the right steps are in place to stop the spreading, I expect the inflection point on the curve will be in about 2 weeks. 

It’ll get bad, but then we will recover. It’ll take time. 

But you’re not going to need to buy a firearm to hunt meat and the stock market isn’t going to drop 80%. 

This is how WSB will get fucked eventually - overconfidence.

Edit: just so you know what I mean by inflection point, I’m talking about the point on the exponential curve where the number of cases in a given day increases by a factor that starts decreasing. That doesn’t meant we automatically bounce there - just that the deceleration of new cases begins (actual cases not whatever fake ass numbers we get from not testing people)."

**Algorithms Take Control of Wall Street** 

LAST SPRING, DOW Jones launched a new service called Lexicon, which sends real-time financial news to professional investors. This in itself is not surprising. The company behind *The Wall Street Journal* and Dow Jones Newswires made its name by publishing the kind of news that moves the stock market. But many of the professional investors subscribing to Lexicon aren't human—they're algorithms, the lines of code that govern an increasing amount of global trading activity—and they don't read news the way humans do. They don't need their information delivered in the form of a story or even in sentences. They just want data—the hard, actionable information that those words represent.

Lexicon packages the news in a way that its robo-clients can understand. It scans every Dow Jones story in real time, looking for textual clues that might indicate how investors should feel about a stock. It then sends that information in machine-readable form to its algorithmic subscribers, which can parse it further, using the resulting data to inform their own investing decisions. Lexicon has helped automate the process of reading the news, drawing insight from it, and using that information to buy or sell a stock. The machines aren't there just to crunch numbers anymore; they're now making the decisions."

In Europe (e.g., Germany, Austria) the virus will take longer to develop, because of the intense counter measures (all university, all schools, all events closes). So probably very limited traveling for 6 months. In countries like China and Italy it is over in say 2-3 months, because they have all the infections at once. Then it's over.

They also ask really dumb questions like “what plays are we making bois” or “I got $210, where should I yolo it?!” Or “Are my puts/calls, gonna print tomorrow?”

I bought some puts before close and kept cash in case of a rip tomorrow morning so I could buy more... but I have a feeling we might see rips all next week. 

The US was just snapped out of any delusion it had by closing tons of colleges/schools/sports/events, Tom Hanks, and all eyes have been on Italy this week. I think a lot of this week was pricing in a worst case scenario. If this is the case bad-but-not-horrible news will be 'good' by contrast and things may start to reverse.

I personally don't think we'll see a bottom until the first major US city quarantine, but I have a feeling this has already started and they won't use that word purposely.

Expect a dead cat bounce over the next week, then a bottoming out over the next 4, then staircase right back to record highs.

Down infinity this year in poker.  If my opponent has an out its coming.

Get into options.  Buy calls at the top a month ago or whatever.  Blow up robinhood acct.  Wait too long to put money on TD.   Miss out on buying puts that I wanted last week.  Don't buy any puts this week because premiums outrageous and is it really just gonna crater every single fucking day?  Apparently so.  But don't worry bull gang.  I'm thinking of getting some puts so as soon as I do the fed  will pump a quadrillion in, virus cure found, travel ban lifted etc.  

Literally can't do anything right this year so far.  Oh yeah on top of that I'm unemployed and maybe have another two months before they come take my house.  I'm sure I'm gonna have great luck finding a job as the entire world shuts down for a new strain of flu.

In cities, if the office workers aren't coming to the office, ordering lunch for events, throwing parties, restaurants and the service industry will get slammed. People will lose jobs cause of lower demand and cause they're sick. Can $SPY go under 200? 

Also $AAPL. I remember the sentiment around AAPL was that it was too overvalued when it was 200-230. It's already 238 after hours right now and we are just a couple of weeks into the virus timeline. Once the american demand goes down, no reason the stock should be this high. I'd say we have a long way to go before we hit the floor for the stock market"

*At first, equities soared on the back of the Fed’s $1.5 trillion liquidity announcement but sellers returned quickly to drive equities sharply lower because these liquidity measures are aimed at normalizing market operations and not stimulating the economy. For example, the Fed will widen the range of its Treasury purchases across different maturities and will offer $500B liquidity through 3- and 1-month operations. All of this helps to relieve the bond market but none of it helps the bottom line of businesses and consumers.*"

No city has been quarantined. No med shortages have been experienced. For the most part, you can still find whatever piece of garbage you want at the store, or worst case on Amazon. 

There is still so much pain to come, and we've already fallen so far.

I also got told today my entire company is going down for the foreseeable future in the next 2 weeks. Gonna get two more checks from them and then unemployment. 

How fucked am I bois? For me, worse case scenario is 50% loss in these puts, putting back to where I started before the dips. Although I don't think that'll happen.
