Stocks do not go up forever.

EDIT: 

I'll be selling out of the money call spreads in Apple, Tesla, etc.

I'll buy put spreads with the long position in the money and short position out of the money. 

I'll open more long put calendar spreads in the indices (depending which has the lowest volatility because these are long volatility positions). 

Otherwise, i'm closing almost all of my short premium positions today in X, ROKU, FDX, DKS, etc. 

I'll sell one or two more puts in /ng, probably the $1.95 or $2 depending on the premium. 

I'll also probably go long gold today by selling an out of the money put in /gc. I don't like this play very much because the volatility is low in there, but I want some long exposure to gold and I dont want to buy a position outright."

Currently 10 year yield is at 1.90% vs. SPY's yield of 1.75% so the market is a bit overvalued even considering the low interest environment. Ideally you want SPY's yield to be 2.0% when 10 year yield is at 1.90%."

Not much to say other than it's yet another bulls on parade sort of day. We haven't quite hit a resistance for SPY so theoretically there's still a bit more to run. 324.5 before closing tomorrow is the resistance. I've been tracking QQQ (and AAPL) which both broke their wedge patterns today, which makes me believe that SPY is probably quite capable of also breaking its resistance. 

For now, tomorrow's ranges are 321.5 and the before-mentioned 324.5, though in spite of my statement above in regards to QQQ, I'm not expecting anything past that sort of euphoria. If anything, indicators seem to suggest buying should slow and we may flatten out a bit by closing, even if we have an intraday pump close to 324. However all we do lately is buy buy buy no matter what, and the Fed's got tendies on their mind that they can't get enough. So who knows.

Either way, see you all tomorrow and remember that if Santa hasn't taken your tendies away it means the tax man will."

2019-12-26 21:09:35,WorstOfWallstreet,2,"I managed to undo 2/3rds of the loss from Christmas Eve.

A loss that was made almost twice as bad because of my tp hands that day. A loss that, if sat through, would have printed me $42k today.

But I turned a -$1200 day into +875, so I won't complain..

Holding Amazon calls.. could have been holding more."

2019-12-26 21:06:41,oregon_forever,45,"I'm a bull and have been for years but this constant pumping of the market by the Fed has to be borderline criminal. They are stealing from future generations to make boomers rich to ensure that they vote for trump again next year.

They are pumping the market so high that annual returns will be 2-3% once boomers retire rich and happy and younger generations will have to work until they literally drop dead."
