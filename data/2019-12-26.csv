Stocks do not go up forever.

EDIT: 

I'll be selling out of the money call spreads in Apple, Tesla, etc.

I'll buy put spreads with the long position in the money and short position out of the money. 

I'll open more long put calendar spreads in the indices (depending which has the lowest volatility because these are long volatility positions). 

Otherwise, i'm closing almost all of my short premium positions today in X, ROKU, FDX, DKS, etc. 

I'll sell one or two more puts in /ng, probably the $1.95 or $2 depending on the premium. 

I'll also probably go long gold today by selling an out of the money put in /gc. I don't like this play very much because the volatility is low in there, but I want some long exposure to gold and I dont want to buy a position outright."
