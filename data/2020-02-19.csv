2020-02-20 14:57:34,jessew16,0,"Understanding calls and puts

I was wondering if someone could help explain calls and puts. 

I have researched for a bit and understand the basics. What I don’t understand is figuring out how much a call would cost and how much it would pay. 

For example: 

Say Tesla is at 900 a share. I put a call for 1200 by October. How do I know how much it will cost me? How do I know how much I’ll make if it hits 1200? 

What if I put the call in at 850 and it goes up to 1200? 

I just can’t seem to grasp the price/roi and the idea of when and how much to bet. 

Thanks"
