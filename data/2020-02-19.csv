2020-02-20 14:57:34,jessew16,0,"Understanding calls and puts

I was wondering if someone could help explain calls and puts. 

I have researched for a bit and understand the basics. What I don’t understand is figuring out how much a call would cost and how much it would pay. 

For example: 

Say Tesla is at 900 a share. I put a call for 1200 by October. How do I know how much it will cost me? How do I know how much I’ll make if it hits 1200? 

What if I put the call in at 850 and it goes up to 1200? 

I just can’t seem to grasp the price/roi and the idea of when and how much to bet. 

Thanks"

**Reuters reports that malls in Daegu, the country’s fourth largest city (population of 2.5 million), were largely empty.**

“We are in an unprecedented crisis,” the city’s mayor Kwon Young-jin said.

Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 31 new cases of the virus on Thursday, following 20 a day earlier, taking the total across the country to 82.

Of that national tally, 49 patients are from Daegu or nearby and have been traced to an infected person who attended a local church, a scenario that KCDC described as a “super-spreading event”.

By 2024, boom technologies will have created the new and improved Concorde jet. The spaceship company will be assisting them manufacture them. Almost all of the options to purchase these aircraft have been sold to buyers, including japan airways and the god, Richard Branson owns 10 options for these aircraft. 

Branson is a proven success in the airline industry, and he definitely has the money and the connections to make this shit happen. 

This space tourism shit is going to be big as well, but this shit is really just a side hustle. This company wants to make NYC to Tokyo in 3 hours a reality. In the meantime though, they'll be making pornos in space with leo, getting sweet NASA contracts, and posting sick space stuff on insta.

Just the other day some young upstart unseated the long time champion Sebulba in a recent race and won his freedom but that’s just the headline. I dug a little deeper and it turns out he was using a  proprietary type of engine that is going to REVOLUTIONIZE both ground and air travel. Can you say patented tech? Now there is a small hiccup that a junker named Watto still has control of the R&D but I’ve heard that he can be bought (just don’t bring republic credits).

If it follows SPCE that means  🔌  has about 6 more days of full retard strength. HOWEVER unlike SPCE,  🔌  has an all time high of $1400. My predicition is that  🔌  has potential to hit 100% days for several weeks before meeting resistance at $1399. By then you just dump and profit."

2020-02-20 01:43:15,BravoDelta279,12,"The most compelling bull case right now is that there is no credible bear case,” UBS Global Wealth Management strategists led by David Lefkowitz said in a note to clients. Stocks continue to look attractive versus low bond yields, they said, and the earnings yield on stocks is “still quite appealing.”
As nuts as they are, shares look tame compared with options. Investors bought to open almost 24 million call options last week, a record amount, according to Sundial Capital’s Jason Goepfert. That as selling of calls to close dropped nearly 30% from the level a couple of weeks ago. The difference between the two is a record.
Options activity in individual stocks has also been startling. About 630,000 put and call options on Virgin Galactic changed hands on Tuesday, almost twice as much as its previous record on Friday. Total options volume on Tesla reached a record of 1.3 million contracts earlier this month.

That said, I ate my words and played the trend.  I bought today during the dip, when it bottomed at 32, and that trade payed off big time as SPCE went from up 10% at the time to close up 22%.

Today's close was strong bullish, and I expect this to open tomorrow around $42 and close between $43 and $48.  I hope I'm right because I bought a $50c for 2/21 at close.

j33tAy, if you have questions about modding, make sure you tag/message u/Ryhearst or u/WilliamNyeTho since those are the other two lead janitors and will be your direct reports. 

Some mod guidelines for you: remember to have fun and be responsible with your power, remove the extra spammy and low quality posts/comments, give out flairs sparingly, bans for minor offenses should be between 1-3 days, major offenses can be up to permanent, and the area we need help the most is the mod mail.

We have stocks that are running 100+ percent in days or weeks. It’s just ridiculous. 

When TSLA was at $500 I thought that was too rich. When SPCE was at $19 I thought that was too rich. It doesn’t matter, these things are trading on pure speculation. Just get in these things when they are on fire and set tight stops. It sounds too simple but honestly that’s all you have to do when shit is just going parabolic."

This week thus far has been a really gross ""follow-the-crayons exactly"" market. [As predicted yesterday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5yqz8/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_19_2020/fi2rute/) we opened green, tested the 338.9, got rejected, and now closed below it. Again, if you look at the crayons [we follow trends pretty much exactly.](https://imgur.com/Ld8ihxU) 

/NQ futures just tested resistance again. Pajama traders have been selling a bit after resistance every time since Feb 11, and as soon as market opens, we grind back upwards to re-test the resistance. With VIX still slightly above support and SPY having some more room to run into resistance, and no major economic news on the calendar tomorrow, the more likely scenario is consolidate or stay green tomorrow. Resistance tomorrow is 339.6. Support is about 337.7.

Good luck and get tendies."

2020-02-19 21:07:25,AdmiralVonBroheim,12,"Holding my $SPCE 2/21 27 through the conference, I sold most of my position earlier this week for 1300% gains. Glad I held onto this final contract, up 1277% today, and thinking that goes up even more tomorrow after the Barclay's conference. Also holding a 2/28 43 call, might sit on it and dump before earnings on the 25th. Curious what other 2/21 & 2/28 holders are going to do."
