If they were, why have the majority frozen hiring until 2021 at the earliest?

Why are they all cutting guidance?

Why are projects getting postponed and budgets getting slashed?

2020-07-23 08:28:05,CuriousManiac,5,"/ES RSI is at 66. Last time it went above 70 we dumped for three days straight, including June 11th, the biggest drop since March 16th. A pullback here would be healthy, and allow you retards a chance to reload on calls. I'm not saying it will dump tomorrow, but if it doesn't soon things are gonna get real ugly real fast. 

Also don't forget that the FOMC is next week, and we all know how the last one ended.

Another point to consider is that $DXY is testing it's March lows. If the $DXY starts rallying off lows stocks are going to sell-off hard.

This would seem to indicate that next week is going to be a struggle for stonks."

I see hundreds of twits, tweets, and posts every day repeating ""virus = bad for airlines"" like it's a hot take and they're sharing insider info that nobody else has thought of. Is there literally any observation in the entire global economy, anywhere, that is more obvious than ""virus = bad for airlines""?

AAL's share price has dropped 62% since February. I just don't get how people think the airlines' issues aren't incredibly transparent already. Almost all of the news that affects their business is public because it's virus news, travel news, Boeing news, stimulus news, etc.. We can see the TSA numbers. Airlines don't have news to surprise investors with on earnings calls. Their laundry is always out in the open. I don't get this widespread senitment that somehow AAL is going to have an absolutely devastating ER that *nobody* expects and the stock is going to drop 10-30%. I don't think there is a single sane person who thinks it's going to look good. This is the literal definition of ""priced in""."

2020-07-23 06:33:33,Lootra,27,"Looks like my account will officially go to 0 today. 7k-30k-0.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I've been depressed my entire life, but at least I always had something to look forward to--(maybe my account will make a big profit tomorrow).

Now? Now I have literally nothing to look forward to. Escaping the hell of my current situation will go from .00001% to 0% in just a few short hours. What am I to do then?

I've tried drugs. I've tried therapy. They didn't work. I'm 33 years old, miserable, and with nothing to show for it. When I moved here to be a teacher 7 years ago, I had nothing. And that's exactly where I am now. Barely enough to pay my bills and I don't get paid again until the end of August. Nothing I can even call my own. Tons of student debt I'll never pay off too.

I don't feel like a real person. Nothing brings me joy and it feels like I've worn a mask my entire life. In high school, I watched normal kids laughing and smiling and always felt like an outsider. It came so easily to them. In college I watched students come to class energetic and eager, and it looked so natural. It's like we were playing different games or I was missing something. As early as 3rd grade, I felt like an outsider. I got straight F's and didn't play with the other kids. I just couldn't understand it. It has always felt I was viewing my life from the eyes of another.

I can't focus on anything. I can't pursue my dreams. I can't maintain any type of friendship or relationship. I can't stay motivated for more than a few minutes. I can't even watch tv, read a book, or play video games-- my anxiety and depression simply won't allow it. My elbows are rubbed raw from the arms of my computer chair.

I've been exercising and trying to lose weight, but I broke today at the realization of the state of my life and ate like 6000 calories. Currently drinking a large milkshake.

It seems hopeless. And the shitty part is that I never asked for this. I never asked to be born, yet people tell me I should be thankful for this special gift. My life is a living hell and there are at least 40 years of it left. I have insomina so I can't even sleep it away. Just alone with the miserable company of my own thoughts.

Downloading robinhood in March was the worst decision of my life. It caused me to allow myself to form some type of hope of truly bettering my situation. Things are easier when you are at rock bottom and hopeless, than when you are at rock bottom and have hope. When you're hopeless nothing else can really hurt you anymore. Now, that false hope was stripped from me and I'm I've discovered rock bottom can always go deeper.

Now, it seems like the start of 1st grade was a blink ago, even though 27 years have passed. And what have I accomplished during that time? What could I have accomplished? 27 years from now, when I'm 60, will this moment feel like a blink ago? Will I be as equally miserable and unsuccessful as I am now? Will I find myself in an even lower bottom? Will I still be alone?

The only thought that brings me something that could even be compared to joy is the knowing of the inexorability of time. No matter how much pain or loneliness I experience, the clock will continue to tick. This pain isn't forever. One day, 4 billion years of evolution will end when I cease to be a conscious entity."

Wearing a summer dress that perfectly matched her body, to the point where the dress perfectly accentuated her large butt, as she was walking towards the entrance of Sprouts. She must have been about 5’10, 5’11 with her height enhancing sneakers. Immediately, I thought to myself I must go back to chat with her. So I turn the car around and drive back to the parking lot, as I approach the entrance I see a long line and decide not to wait, because by the time I get in she might be on her way out. So, I sit in my car and wait for her to leave the store, so I can chat it up. I see her walk out, as she walks towards my car, we make eye contact. Mind you she's wearing a mask so I can’t really tell what the bottom half of her face looks like. I get out of the car, approach her as she's perpendicular to the rear bumper and say ""Hi, how are you"", to which she replies ""good"". Not knowing what else to say, I blurt out, ""You look familiar, I think we've met before"". Which she replies, "" I don't think so, I'm like sixteen"". My only reply at that moment was, ""holy shit"", as she walked right past me. This fucking chick could pass for 24-27, anyhow, I just told her ""have a good day"" and she said ""thanks"". I sit back in my car feeling defeated, I think about what she immediately said, then It hits me, I’m 5’11-6’ tall, well-built muscularly and can seem intimidating if you don’t know me. I consider myself, a decent looking fellow. I concluded; I must have scared the shit out of this chick with my approach, she must have felt intimidated. A stranger approaching her in a parking lot of a Sprouts, without any other prior interaction. Oh well, On to the next."

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

Rough volatility do shake the darling bulls of May (and June/July....),

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.

Sometime too bright the top of Satya's bald head shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or JPOW's changing course, untrimmed;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

Nor shall bears brag thou wand’rest in their caves,

When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.

So long as bulls can breathe, or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

1) on a ticker like tsla post earnings is there a chance that I could get that thing filled at something over 1000? Seems like there’s so much movement and the prices are high that sometimes the next on the chain will be a tad behind or ahead. 

2) I don’t really want to hold longer because it would suck to go to zero and my profits are capped. What’s a good strategy for dumping a spread like this? 

3) is there a decent way to lock in gains on a debit spread like this?

Seems like open is the best time to try to dump it. Any advice appreciated. I should have read more before trying spreads. They safer but not if you’re unsure about getting out. 

It’s been a bad week otherwise maybe I’d roll the dice by closing the short calls and letting the long calls ride."

2020-07-23 01:06:46,liquiddandruff,33,"I saw Trevor Milton at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

When she got to her parents house, they said they weren't really comfortable letting her in because they had been quarantining seriously. She convinced them to let her stay with them. 10 days later they both had COVID, and now her dad is dead.

The sheer demand for tsla tomorrow (due to fomo OTM calls purchased and MM/algos adjusting to go delta neutral) plus the inherent volatility in the stock may not kill call holders on IV as violently as it seems. I mean sure there will be an IV crush but there are a lot of catalysts surrounding tsla, the crush may not be as bad as projected. 

Another point, far OTM calls and/or close expirations are less sensitive to changes in IV (lower Vega) as opposed to near/ITM calls and/or long term expirations (higher Vega)."

2020-07-22 23:38:16,isospeedrix,4,"If you're dying to know how much ur TSLA calls will be worth tomorrow morning here's a very rough estimate.

The closest ticker that can model tsla's price right now is Citrix, CTXS, whose price is 167. (i can't believe i couldn't find any other ticker that had a range of 160-170). this is close to tesla's price/10.

Their earnings is tomorrow morning so the IV is high, and i expect TSLA's options tomorrow IV to still be high, not high as it is now but about as high as citrix's pre earnings so i think it's a good estimate.

so go look at citrix's options and take ur strike divided by 10, and the value of that option/10 is about how much your option is worth tomorrow morning.

this is assuming tesla is in the 1660-1680 range."

Keep supplies and shit going that far away wouldn't be easy for a ground war. Maybe we help India with some supplies and shit and do air raids.

2020-07-22 23:23:23,BlueJock1969,-2,"Pardon me being a noobie. General Q about bull call spreads using VIX.  I bought 240 8/28 $30.5 calls for $4.  Obviously I'm down.  Thinking bout selling 240 same date/price calls to created a spread at $35.5.  Assume they are priced at $2 per contract.  I know I am paid the premium of $48K ($2 x 24,000).  Thus, my net investment is now $96K.  Am I correct that: 1) my worst case scenario is that VXX closes < $30.5 and I lose 50% (496K - $48k premium on the short leg); 2) best case is it closes above 35.5 and I keep premium of $48K and spread of $120K (5 x 24,000).  In between its just $48K + $24K for every dollar over $30.5.  I know with VXX, there is no assignment of shares.  It's just cash settled.  I'm confused about what happens if it quickly jumps to $34 and I wanna close out.  I assume the short leg will still have time value.  Is that offset by the time value of my long leg?  In other words, if it hits $34.5 next week, can I expect the following return: $48K premium + $96K ($4 gain over long call leg x 24,000)?  Sorry if this is uninformed, but really appreciate any thoughtful responses."

2020-07-22 22:06:33,tonymillergmail,-1,"AXP puts.   American Express Global Business Travel is 50% (GBT) owned by AXP.  As a non-consolidated subsidiary AXP reports revenue and income proportionate to its stake in GBT.

AXP wanted to offload GBT to Carlylse and other but the deal fell through due to pandemic.  CArlylse did not want to fund GBT losses.

As everyone knows, business travel has come to a halt.  This alone will be a $3.5 billion hit to AXP (its share of decline in GBT revenue), and AXP will also be forced to reduce the value of its investment in GBT.    All of this comes on top of AXP having to increase its reserves for prospective deliquencies relative to cardholders participating Covid relief plan.

AXP also is not laying off any of its 60,000 employees.    Consensus among CEOs is that business travel will not come back to pre-covid levels for at least 5 years.   Add cost cutting imposed by businesses to make up for revenue shortfalls and it all adds up to  a HUGE MISS RELATIVE TO EXPECTATIONS.

I estimated quarterly revenue for AMEX to be down far more than 27% estimated by analysts.

I believe revenue will be off by 40%.  Much of this is due to permanent impairment of future cash flows."

make. be thankful you didnt lose your job on the hands of a old sack careless boomer. no more health care in a pandemic or 401k benefits either. scary.

2) its a refund. not a handout. weve been paying taxes into this system every job. blame the govt, blame pay rates

So the guy comes back after getting one of those paper masks from his car or whatever, he's got it on and they let him in, but then he pulls it down on his chin as soon as he past the door.  He's over by me at this point and I give him kind of the evil eye with a WTF look, and he goes ""Buy the fucking dip, maggot"".
