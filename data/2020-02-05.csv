Anyone who doesn’t know enough to answer your questions, will eagerly give you organically bad advice.

It seems like a move borne out of desperation from the impact WuFlu is having on their social structure and manufacturing capacity. By lowering tariffs and ""falling on their sword"" in the years' long trade war with the US, they put themselves in a position where they can accept help from the US and stimulate their own economy.

Superficially, this seems bullish, and I expect the market will react accordingly tmrw (RIP my puts). When the motives to make this move are considered, though, it seems like something rather malignant may lie beneath..."

Some INSANE market numbers

-S&P low from GFC $667 Mar 2009
-Currently $3,335, 5x the bottom
-Market could drop 50% to $1,667 and STILL be All Time High compared to pre 2010

This is what 10yrs QE / low rates will get you.

Can buy SPY Dec 22 put with strike 290 for $21.32

[Between Friends - Captain Murphy ft Earl Sweatshirt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVeDf2bXACc)  


song was wicked, adding it to my ""Wolf of Walmart"" playlist. The video style reminded me of this captain murphy album.  


this album, Duality, is a visual psychedelic cult-themed  ?? hard to define work of fkin art. [The album in it's entirety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGRLDuWfrzM&t=) is still accessible but the video half ^((which solidifies the album as a legitimate piece of art with a message)) of it seems to be lost with time. God damn, I'll try to hunt the full thing down when I have some spare time  
Captain Murphy is an alter-ego of Flying Lotus', which was kept a pretty good secret for a good while.

something I also find interesting is Murphy/Lotus' choice of samples, seen in this

2020-02-06 01:56:40,_foldLeft,7,"Looking at magic lines, it's interesting to see that on /ES + SPY we effectively went from ATHs hitting on the upper bollinger band (RSI over 70 here), sold off to the 50 SMA/lower bollinger band, and have since bounced all the way back up to new ATHs on /ES and SPY as of today/tonight.  
RSI has normalized a bit lower here but is now trending back up towards overbought.  
MACD crossed down but is now looking like it could cross back up... I loaded up on puts short-term (last week) expecting more downside but now it looks like we could potentially be making a further move up, though this gap back up to ATHs has been even more aggressive than our ""correction"" last week.  
Not intelligent to give advice but my feeling is if we break out of the upper bollinger I'm gonna switch to all calls, if we bounce off it then I'm loading up more puts and exiting my long positions for the short-term"

2020-02-05 23:35:27,knotswag,32,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

We've gone up a fairly ridiculous amount in a short period of time. If you're a pattern trader, this behavior resembles that of a bull flag, and in theory it would be the top of a bull flag. If you're a crayon starer like me, we're tapping resistance at 334 as I mentioned yesterday. Either way, these huge jumps should take a breather in theory for a day/show some consolidation tomorrow. 

VIX just touched the bottom of its trendline today. I would be suspicious watching price action tomorrow and Friday. If we get another significant breach in the VIX I would suspect that we'll have some more of the steady increase days we've had before the correction ahead. However, if Friday has weird economic news, I think it would coincide crayon behavior and we'll have another jump in the VIX and a small pullback in the market, though nothing enough to reverse the current bullish trend upwards.

Not much else to say. Good luck everyone and bless the tendies of those that entered TSLA yesterday. Musk giveth, Musk taketh."
