Meaning, they won't benefit at all yet until their process is proven. ADMA's process turns the convalescent plasma into a hyper immune globuin plasma-derived therapy which still needs to be tested in clinical trials to determine whether it is safe and effective. The FDA issued an emergency use for only direct transfusions of convalescent plasma which doctors can order from an FDA-registered blood establishment.

2020-08-24 07:56:03,FrancisCharlesBacon,3,"For all the AAPL split retards on here who don't understand the difference between the announcement date, record date, and effective date. 

**Announcement date** 7/30: First, the company will publicly announce the plans for the split, as well as pertinent details investors need to know. This information generally includes the split ratio and when it will happen, including the dates I describe in the next two bullet points. In addition, companies will often discuss their motivation for the split, especially if it has to do with the health or structure of the business, which is typically the case in a reverse split or creation of a new share class.

**Record date** 8/24: This is an important date when it comes to accounting, but it isn't terribly important for investors to know. The record date is when existing shareholders need to own the stock in order to be eligible to receive new shares created by a stock split. Simply put, if you buy after the record date but before the split is effective, you'll still be entitled to receive new shares when the split takes effect (I'll explain this shortly).

**Effective date** 8/31: The date when the new shares show up in investors' brokerage accounts and the stock begins trading on a split-adjusted basis.

>Forward split case study: Apple's 2014 stock split

>When Apple announced its stock split on April 23, 2014, here's what the company's press release said: ""Each Apple shareholder of record at the close of business on June 2, 2014 will receive six additional shares for every share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 9, 2014.""

>Here's what this meant to investors. 

>Let's say that Apple had traded for $700 per share at the market's close on June 8, the day before the split went into effect. For investors who already owned Apple stock and who held through at least June 9, the process was pretty straightforward. For every share of Apple they had in their brokerage account on June 8, which was worth $700, six more shares of Apple appeared in their brokerage account before trading began on June 9. Each of the seven shares was worth $100 immediately after the split went into effect.

>Here's where the corporate accounting concept of a record date comes in. Let's say that someone bought a share of Apple on June 4, 2014 -- after the record date but prior to the effective date. In this case, the new shares would technically be given to that share's prior owner. However, because they sold their share prior to the split's effective date, those new shares would be transferred (by the brokerage) to the investor who bought the shares.

>In a nutshell, anyone who purchased Apple stock prior to the June 9, 2014, effective date of the 7-for-1 split would have received six new shares.

Source: https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-splits-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx

TL;DR Anyone who purchases AAPL stock up until end of market close, August 28th, will be included in the split. There is no cutoff time tomorrow. 

You can also go down to the Stock Split section on [AAPL's investor relations](https://investor.apple.com/faq/default.aspx) and they explain it there too."

Apparently it is a buy 1 get 4 free type of deal for the stocks. I could not go on any cruises for the past couple of months so I have been spending a lot more time with my grandson. I have not invested in the stock market since 1999 and 2007. Do you think I could perhaps call my old broker at Bear Sterns and ask them to help me buy some shares of Tesla and Apple? I remember Michael from my brokerage Bear Sterns. He was a nice guy and helped me invest in the stock market in 2007. Does anybody have his FAX number I could contact him at? I am hoping to buy some shares of Tesla and Apple as soon as possible while they still have the buy 1 get 4 shares free deal. Oh this is so much more exciting than bingo night.

Best wishes, Shirley"

I've definitely sold calls at a loss only to rebuy them less than a month later with a different exp. date and strike because I'm a bad trader.  Wouldn't that be considered a substantially similar security?  Yet my realized gain/loss with wash trade adjustments report on TD Ameritrade shows my net gain to be substantially less because of realized losses I was sure fell under wash trade rules.  Thanks in advance.

""It turns out that the **stock market** has an uncanny ability to predict who will call the White House home for the next four **years**. If the **stock market** is up in the three months leading up to the **election**, put your money on the incumbent party. Losses over those three months tend to usher in a new party.""

If you think Trump isn't about to do anything and everything in his power to pump this baby to further ATH you're out of your mind. Trump is going to come out with news saying he has a vaccine before the election and continue to pump via twitter.

Opposite for calls, I think MRNA is the move for september. Bollinger band is closing in very tight and the daily RSI/MACD is cooling off heavy from their run up in July. It's also sitting just under the bullish IC green cloud so I think there will be a move next month for MRNA around the same time they announce some news for Phase 2/3"

So I haven't told my mom that I mainly moved from Texas to South Carolina for a girl yet. She has zero clue I visited her twice before moving here. Anyway this weekend my girl and I went to visit her mom 2 hours ago, and yesterday when going to Wendy's, lol, her tire popped. [as you can see ](https://imgur.com/RwLuuAU) take note, it's a red 2005 Toyota Matrix. We got help from a guy who looks and sounds like Larry the cable guy, lol, a friend of my girl's dad. The tire blew at like 6 pm, and it was getting darker because of rain clouds but didn't rain. 

So my mom sent me some messages today, got back from my 3 day vacation today, [that question hit me weirdly, because I had just kissed my girl goodnight and bye](https://imgur.com/zhKAx6g) I was like woah, she asked that. Then I got this, [more on this in a sec](https://imgur.com/8EUfaih), ok more now, she tried calling me Friday evening when I was first meeting my girl's mom, but said I couldn't talk, and then on Saturday, yesterday at the time of writing this, she said that's why I couldn't talk according to her dream. I asked for more details as well and you can see she said an older maroon car. [that's what she sent me, close enough for a dream from last night](https://imgur.com/k6KnfxY) 

But yeah, really weird that she had a dream that a tire was why I couldn't talk to her, she has no clue about my girl and thinks I'm just at home all day, idk when I will tell her the truth"

I'm liquidating some mutual funds ($24,000 worth) to move into RH to be able to day trade again since going sub $25,000. There was a while I was doing really well but one day made a string of really stupid moves. Attached is the last of the holdings in my account (until I make the $24,000 deposit). 

I kind of want to put everything in something highly volatile, right at the money and sell if it goes up a couple bucks. Something like NIO. But then again, could buy ATM leaps in BA and day trade those too. 

Just want to get back my $19,000 is really all. Can't stand being down like this.

2020-08-23 21:39:02,elijaali,-18,"I cringe when people couple vaccines with politics or creed.  Being a trump supporter has nothing to do with vaccines.  Being a democrat has nothing to do with vaccines.  The powers that be want you to take every pressing issue and associate it with a political side so you are simplified as a person and a voter and are ready to demonize anyone who disagrees with you and make assumptions about them.  This is classic divide and conquer and it is WORKING.

Being ANTI VAX means being informed about damages from pharmaceuticals.  $4.5 billion in damages rewarded to families to be exact.  Also, thousands of people have been injured by vaccines.  Hrsa.gov is a great place to view that data.

Being Pro Vax means being optimistic about one particular aspect of pharma that is far from perfect, but the concept is good. It is wonderful to think we can get rid of deadly diseases by injecting doses at an early age.  Unfortunately there’s still a lot of work to do.

Neither thing is bad.  But do you realize how much fuckin money people are makint producing these shots?? Do you realize what MRC5 is?  Did you know Vaccine Court exists?  Did you know there are thousands of deaths every year from shots??

How simple minded are you to think vaccines are flawless?  Why do you think they call medicine a practice?  Because its PRACTICE.  Not a single pharma product doesn’t have side effects.  Fuckin morons.

I am a progressive, liberal, mixed race democrat and guess what?  My son doesnt have ANY VACCINES.  And hes NEVER BEEN SICK.  Not even a fuckin cold.  Oh and by the way?  I OWN GUNS, LOTS OF THEM.  Oh and guess what?  I dont mind Trump at all, know why?  Because I know that PRESIDENCY is a PRESIDENT not a POSITION of POWER.  There are people behind the scenes banking on your ignorance and compliance."

Other countries aren't doing this.. China and Europe aren’t doing this, they are working and chipping away in a manner that is in keeping with the reality that is been broadly presented to them. In the US reality is getting very distorted and there’s a big problem with ideological loyalty.

2020-08-23 20:25:00,Dmoan,3,"People always point out to Microsoft anti trust ruling and say Washington might do similar things against Apple. But situation is far different:

There were multiple companies lobbying against Microsoft (Oracle, Ibm etc ) in 00s where as not many stand against Apple now. While Microsoft ironically has now raised concern about App Store it is not willing to fight in Washington over it.

Bill gates was known to be not willing to engage in aggressive lobbying, unlike Apple which throws millions

Microsoft wasn’t well liked by Washington or general populace unlike Apple

Washington is far more pro big business and cares less about competition or consumers now, when compared to 00s especially after dot com bubble.

So end of day nothing will happen to Apple and stock market knows it"
