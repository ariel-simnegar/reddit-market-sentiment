Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie. Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie. Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy, he can call Paulie. But now the guy's got to come up with Paulie's money every week. No matter what. Business bad? **** you, pay me. Oh, you had a fire? **** you, pay me. The place got hit by lightning, huh? **** you, pay me. Also, Paulie could do anything. Especially run up bills on the joint's credit. And why not? Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway. And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount. You take a two hundred dollar case of booze and you sell it for a hundred. It doesn't matter. It's all profit. And then finally, when there's nothing left, when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze, you bust the joint out.

I realized that whenever I read some bullish DD on here, the author is generally right about the direction the stock will move in. The thing that eludes people is the timing of the stock, people pick the right direction (call or put) but usually fuck up the expiry or strike price.

So I've started buying *shares* of stocks from the bullish DD on WSB, and I've had very good results. It's not 6 baggers, but I've increased my net worth ~35%. This is partly due to the fact that I know my investment has a very small chance to go to zero, unlike options, so I'm willing to make much bigger investments rather than just a few g on some options."

Current plays: 

Don‚Äôt bother shit talking I‚Äôll just ignore,

4- AAPL 9/4 $131.25c

1- INTC 1/15/21 $50c

5- GE 1/15/21 $9c (don‚Äôt expect much, they were just cheap) 

1- PFE 7/16/21 $37c 

Own 400 shares of KODK for an average cost of $6.04; sold 2- 1/15/21 $7.5 covered calls and 2- 4/16/21 $7.5cc. Don‚Äôt care if it randomly jumps and I get exercised I‚Äôll make $1.46 (optimistically) on the back end if so, if not then I‚Äôll re-roll 4 more sells of CCs. 

Plays I‚Äôm looking at: 

1- ATVI 11/20 $85c 

1- PFE 9/16/22 $35c or $37c 

Still trying to decide if I want to do some NIO $15c leaps for either 11/20/20, 1/15/21, 2/19/21, 1/21/22, or 12/22/22, all the prices aren‚Äôt bad even for later dates."

I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. I'm not a religious man, but I often let my mind slip away as I imagine holding her again in heaven, or some other ethereal place. I don't believe, but I like to pretend that I do, if  only for a fleeting moment. 

I turn on my digiwall and flip through old pictures. It's her. For a moment, I can almost smell her in the room. Strawberries, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check the S&P futures. 3522.

Anyways, I had the best two week run ever. 

TSLA Aug 21 '20 $1800 Calls @ $27.20 held to last day and sold @ $240.70 . 

AMZN Aug 21 '20 $3200 Calls @ $20.84 held to last day and sold @ 94.00. 

BABA Aug 28 '20 $270 Calls @ $3.55 held to last day and sold @ $18.00.

RKT Sep 18 '20 $15 Calls @ 4.70 still holding. 

FDX Sep 18 '20 $220 Calls @ 5.10 still holding. 

And AAPL shares but shares are boring.


Point being, I love you guys, but mentally it's so much more refreshing to not be checking this sub and the charts every day. Just let JPOW and Elon do what they do best. 


Now I am going to do the same. Load up on calls on Monday with 2 week out plays and enjoy life.  But what are the plays? TSLA, AMZN, and AAPL still?"

Rocket boasts a 76% retention rate for refinancing, compared to an¬†industry average of just 22%. And its J.D. Power Net Promoter Score (NPS), a measure of consumer satisfaction, stands at 74, compared to an industry average of just 16.
Rocket‚Äôs online-only model also gives the company a massive efficiency advantage. The average loan takes only 32 days to close, or 25% faster than competitors. According to Nerdwallet, its fee rate typically runs¬†just 0.5% of the loan amount, rather than the typical 0.5% ‚Äì 1% range.
In other words, the company does a far better job providing quality services online at lower costs.

A few years ago, my aunt passed and left me with 50k. I spent 9-10k on debt, maybe 15k paying off student loans. Spent maybe 10-12k in one year just fucking around doing drugs and hookers (sometimes). If I had the option to do the last part over again, I definitely wouldn't.

Left with 13k, some idiot recommended me to put it all in weedstocks, namely, CGC, APHA and ACB. This was in mid-2019 and we all know what happened to weedstocks then. IDK why I waited so long, but I finally cashed out with 6k. Late 2019, I meet WSB. Lets make all my money back with options!! Sounds easy enough, fucking idiots can do it, why cant I?

6k went down to $600, rode that $600 up to 11k during the March crash with puts. 11k went down to 1.2k, and now im sitting at 8.7k. I've learnt a tremendous amount of information about the market this year from options, and from you guys. Mods are gay."

Herman Miller has always been at the top of the list when it comes to office chairs to invest in. Google interest has over doubled in the past 6 months and I think they're set to crush earnings on the 16th. Plus I think this is their chance to run back up to pre-covid levels.

""While it's not that well known here, it is going to be a very big name and an important name to hold in portfolios. So, the international product will give exposure to that and you can buy this in U.S. dollars, so, it's a vehicle that's efficient for a U.S. dollar investor.""
And Renaissance's International fund will likely have early access, Smith said.

2020-08-30 20:39:50,nativemoonman,9,"idk about you all.. but i hope some of you have been paying attention to the dollar index and how fucked it is. never in the history of anything have we been in a position like we are in today. BOTH CHINA AND RUSSIA in the 1st quarter of 2020 had  the dollar's share of trade between them fall below 50% for the first time on record.

 if thats not an alarm bell idk wtf is. shitcoin will continue to show its dominance and resilience. with yield farming earning upwards of 7% and people lending and borrowing their own shitcoins theres is really no need for banks. With cryto being a actual asset now in the eyes of the SEC theres nothing holding it back.  thus why MIT was just recruited by the administration to develop its own digital currency.. only a couple years behind china HAHA 

hyper inflation will occur and tendies will rise in these assets meant to protect against inflation. I'm balls deep in SLV spreads only because theres so much more room for growth with the amount of catch up it has to play with compared to GOLD.  yea ive had a 12,000 week only to be greedy and not think a pullback was imminent. its going to happen like with everything else that is somewhat close to fundamentals. everything we use day to day is already inflated (coffee lumber meat) and whats last is the dollar. best of luck and i hope you all take profit and continue to juice the last of the melt up.

good riddance ya fucks"
