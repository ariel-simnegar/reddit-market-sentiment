\- Re-do the lockdowns and economy is getting hit hard again: NAB estimates Melbourne's 6-week lockdown will detract 1.1ppts from Q3 Australian GDP.

\- Don't do lockdowns and let the virus run its course: Worst case scenario 1% death would result in 1% decrease in GDP

\- Don't do lockdowns and follow health rules: (i.e. Sweden) Even this doesn't save the economy, as Sweden GDP shrank in first quarter. (due to lack of demand & spending)"

2020-07-08 09:07:48,Ardesic53,-31,"##I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

##No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

#I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

#I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

#Little did I know.

^I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

#Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

#Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

#Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

#As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony."

In high school, I was taking a shit/watching porn on my phone. All of a sudden, the alarm system blared up:

""This is not a drill. There is an active shooter in the area. Close all classrooms and cover all windows."" Played x3.

I kid u not, I didn't even wipe my shit. Bolted outta the bathroom, straight to the nearest classroom which had a bunch of freshman. Pounded on the door, telling them it's just me not the actual shooter. I heard the kids inside ""Don't open the door!! We don't know!!"" Luckily the teacher saw my freaked out face and let me in. lmfao. I quite literally smelled like shit.

After the whole ordeal was over, I went back to the bathroom, cleaned my shit, and finished my wank. Turns out it was a prison escapee that wasn't even within a few miles, but they took the precaution."

Such a badass name.

NVAX shot up over 30% on OWS funding news yesterday.

The obvious question becomes....

WHO WILL GET THE NEXT BIG CASH DUMP????

Anyone have any insights on OWS and how we can keep tabs on where the money is flowing?

We know they plan to boost 7 vaccine candidates with BARDA funding.

I pay the $98 per year for Walmart's existing grocery delivery service. Haven't gone to the store all year. Well worth it to me, considering that Amazon's grocery is so overpriced because it's from Whole Foods. A gallon of Milk is literally $6 from Amazon grocery. At Walmart it's under $2. 

Also, it's great having same day delivery. The selection isn't as vast, but for common household essentials, Walmart is my go-to now. Whenever I need something, I just add it to the cart in my Walmart app and place the order when I hit the minimum for delivery. 

They're also pushing Sam's Club heavily lately, and I canceled my Costco membership in favor of that too. I actually prefer Sam's Club too. More variety and better value. 

I bought a shitton of $135 August calls when I saw the Walmart+ news pop up. Between the parking lot drive in movie theaters, Shopify integration, and now Walmart+, I think the Walmart 5 years from now will be a vastly different and modern company. They're innovating at an astonishing rate."

Their progress on swapping their non-agency holdings to agency is really the catalyst for their path to recovery vs further slippage but without that info you'd be playing the market's assumption vs what's really going on. Right now they are trailing VNQ snd XLRE so either the traders are right and they are lagging on that front or the traders are assuming they haven't transitioned like they said on their earnings call. If everyone's really in the dark then they are assuming they're holding the same profile they had on the 22nd, but if they transitioned to the secure stuff before the mortgage drop then there'll be some decent gains to be had at the next 10-Q for calls. The drop from $4.20 to $3.20 has been on sentiment instead of fundamentals so any clarification on their current position could cause a major shift either way"

2020-07-08 05:39:38,Ardesic53,-34,"I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony."

No, this bull was feral, wild, out-of-control. As the sun crested to the west from its southern apex, I began to creep in, lasso in hand. With the closing day, I sprang upon him, while he reeked of pheromones, high in the fury and ecstasy of his rut. Yet a drop of blood filled his eyes. I wrangled with him through the night, and just before the opening morning, while exhausted and down, I plunged my Boone knife deep into his flank, then again and again. Leaving little left of me. The blood began to run. Crimson colored in the morning light. The blood flows deep, as he lies next to me. Taking his last breathes."

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.

We reopened back in May, and everyone wanted to get out and about, why would everyone be staying inside ordering from amazon. Also unemployment high as fuck, everyone is throwing money into amazon stock vs actually getting shit from amazon. We will see how overvalued that shit is. Remember last quarter when it was at all time high and dropped and fucked us up. Also they are having a lot of coronavirus expenses to pay.

..

&#x200B;

I want to create a Bluetooth Enabled Penile Implant (working name - B.E.P.I.).  Here are some thoughts on how I, its first and most passionate user, would program it:

1. Connect it to signals on my chart 
   1. Underlying more than 2% above VWAP: boner - Green setting
   2. IV go over a certain percentage: boner - Green setting
   3. Gap up at open: super bone - Raging Green setting
   4. Globex futes +/ *any-fucking-thing short of the 2nd limit up/down*: no reaction.
      1. Futes .5% away from limit up/down: Raging Green (op. to make gains)
   5. Asia up/down: ""cold day at the pool"" setting
   6. Euros up/down: semi
   7. Market closed for holiday: Whiskey dick setting (Red setting), or Raging Green.
2. Connect to account: simple. Up/down, but on a *lock*.  Sex life.  Over.  Even solo.  Can't fool this fucking thing with a paper trading account. 
   1. Margin call: ""First Margin Call"" setting.  After all, there's no margin call like your first margin call.
   2. Assignment: varies, but for the first, unplanned time: ""First Margin Call"" setting.  After all, they both feel pretty much the same.
   3. Shares called away: varies
3. Connect to WSB
   1. bears r fuk: erectile dysfunction setting
   2. bulls r fuk: see #1
   3. kangaroo / jpow / printer-fucking-brr / etc: well, I was about to say, ""exploding battery function"", but that's not at all what I want.

etc... I need to give this some serious thought, but I want to fund the creation of the worlds first bluetooth-enabled penile implant.  This will be my contribution to the world."

2) The Fed and central banks will relentlessly print money until their printers overheat.

3) Consumers are obliviously optimistic and crave to spend every penny they have on goods and services they don’t need.

4) Ultimately, barring any significant increase in Covid deaths, people are going to finally call bullshit on the virus being a threat. They’ll swiftly return to traveling, shopping, eating out, etc.

2020-07-08 03:43:09,Huckleberry_Ginn,26,"# Market Predic_Ginn, July 8th

## Events Tomorrow

* MBA Mortgage Application Index (7am)
* EOA Crude Oil Inventories (10:30am)
* Consumer Credit (3pm)

## Notable Earnings Tomorrow

* Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY, after hours). A large retailer with a struggling presence even before covid. Look for the market to extrapolate the earnings to other retailers in similar positions. Any loss here will be shifted towards online giants (Amazon, Wayfair, Walmart, etc.).

## News Today (July 7th)

* Rumors of Walmart launching a service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc.
* U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO)
* Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011

# Bear Day Prediction

* Spy tilts towards 305. If deaths spike, and TX, FL, AZ, Las Vegas, or CA consider shutting down (to some extent), I believe we will see a similar sell off as today in travel sectors. I believe the inevitable realization that you have to slow down coronavirus is settling in. Coronavirus will not slow down on its own.
* I believe a reality and market check will happen by the end of the week. This means a bloody day (6/4, 6% drop).

Earnings will be a pivotal stretch for the market. Considering April and May were some of the highest saving months on record, money was not moving and when money isn't moving revenue is dropping across the economy. The aftermath could be a steady -3 to -5% per week as earnings continue. Final support is 250 (+/-25), no way we dip below March.

# Bull Day Prediction

* Spy pushes towards 318 behind tech and cloud firms (F, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.). There may be a flight to quality heading to earnings season, which will bolster SPY, DAQ, etc. R2000 and others may suffer. I believe the global response to Covid will ensure a stronger rebound in the supply chain, which we so often hear about. I believe part of the bounce early this week was in part to supply chain (China rockets up 5%, we follow suit).
* I don't see spy escaping 320 this week. No one will be going out of their way to buy heavy before earnings. As mentioned above, earnings will be important. The market could realistically carry to 350 if earnings are not ""that bad."" If consumers shifted their demand to tech and away from entertainment, I believe we will just see a shift similar in the market (I believe we're already seeing it now. Fuck TSLA tho.)

# Kang Gang Prediction

* Everyone is too scared to do anything, volume remains low and prices remain flat. Go back to Australia you fucks. Spy 314 EoD and bouncing between 300-325 for 3 months with Jerome tugging us like fucking toddlers in a wagon away from scary bears."

Amazon just started rolling out same day Prime delivery on a subset of their items a year or two ago. And it's goal was to drive new customers to shop online, not transition existing customers from shopping in store to get delivery.

2020-07-08 02:59:18,Singleguywithacat,21,"IM going to beat this drum until my arm falls out.

Toyota did 11 million cars in 2019, with 20 billion in profits, excluding profits from their insurance arm (warranties and finance money that is deferred overseas).  TSLA did 350K units and was profitable (barely) from selling EV credits subsidized by the government (which will be running out this year).

Toyota has revenue streams from finance, insurance, service and parts.  TSLAs profits from these streams are non-existent.   Toyota has the best selling hybrid of all-time, it's foolish to think that they or Honda could not not develop a fully capable EV vehicle for the masses.

EV is a niche product, that is catching some FOMO.  For the average consumer, a combustion engine is a lot more convenient, or just a regular hybrid, which will get 50 MPG.   When it isn't cool to own a TSLA anymore, you will see how quickly the escalator goes down.

TSLA now has the market cap of Toyota, Honda, Ford and Nissan combined.  If you don't see a problem with this, then I suggest you keep buying, indefinitely.  Arguments about self-driving vehicles,  or some pie in the sky future where nobody owns a car because there autonomous model 3s acting as Taxis, is not a viable argument for a current valuation, when Google and uber are front-running the tech as well.

If you don't think it's a bubble, explain how NKLA, which doesn't actually have a working product, has a larger market cap than Nissan and Ford, and only half of Honda.  BC the EV hype is reaching levels of digital coin hype... and it does not end well."

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."

Crazy valuations for coins that literally didn't do shit, and didn't deserve any of their market cap. Arguing with ppl now about TSLA is like arguing back then. These people have alll the answers, and it has nothing to do with it being an absolute bubble. You morons think that it's normal for NIO to run up 400% in a month? Earth to people buying this junk, today's EVs are yesterdays Digital currencies. EVs is a niche tech nobody asked for, and is easily duplicated. I'd much rather have a hybrid that I can plug in (or not), and not have to worry about finding the nearest charge station if I am running low. Self-driving cars have massive hurdles to go over, and again, it's a tech nobody asked for, just like digital coins.

2020-07-08 02:28:18,UsuallylurknotToday,17,"Unpopular Opinion, fully prepared for the billionaire living out his popular highschool kid fantasy and his troll army to come for me: Elon Musk is a fucking creep and a bad dude, even if he is a fucking genius. He operates in bad faith and eats mad peen in the ""quality of person"" department. His most loyal subjects are just wealthier versions of incel and TD type personalities and techies/old people with money (unrelated to the first two groups, but unfortunately in their company). 

&#x200B;

I kinda think NKLA is a dogshit company and something just smells fraud-y about their CEO, but I still believe there's merit to his ""TSLA shills, paid or unpaid, are attacking the integrity of his company (which I think is dogshit)"" claim. Wouldn't put it past (F)elon Musk to do something like that. Though it was obviously overvalued and hyped, he still has to defend his company now whereas a normal decline wouldve been seen as the market cooling off and not the dumping of a fraud. Straight out of the Trump Truthbending Tactics playbook.

&#x200B;

Why would he do this? Because the capital that pumped NKLA is chasing after electric/hydrogen fuel cell gains. TSLA, already horrendously overvalued, doesnt seem like a value play with cheaper competitors emerging. Therefore, Musk is destroying NKLA's rep while TSLA is at a crazy high valuation because the capital flight from NKLA will divert to TSLA, ""the only viable option for this kind of exposure.""  Felon gets his $35b bonus as a result. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: (F)elon Musk looks like Jar Jar binks kinda and also may be guilty of fraud/manipulation/corporate sabotage."

They are significantly larger than every retailer on earth, including Amazon. 

Their grocery business alone is the size of Amazon as a whole. 

Amazon has 75 fulfillment centers. Walmart has over 300 mini fulfillment centers (stores) in Texas alone. Each store is equipped with the majority of things people need (groceries, household appliances, etc)

They are mother fuckers logistically and can offer same day shipping on most household goods. Something Amazon won’t be able to do outside of major cities. Walmart will also cost less for shipping because they can essentially pay delivery drivers to handle weight at a fraction of the cost versus traditional shipping services.

Amazon knew this day was coming, hence the move to next day and same day prime (where they could pull it off).

Walmart is coming. Buy your calls while you can."

2020-07-08 01:42:42,CaptFeelsBad,6,"I’m going to reiterate my [MRK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hkpyve/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_july/fww5ouh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) comment with some additional research. 

First off, there’s currently a huge [shortage ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) of HIV meds where basically what happened is part supply chain disrupt, but also the two drugs they were using proved to be ineffective for HIV patients because of covid. Something about them is no longer working. 

Secondly, MRK’s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. 

Thirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they’ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. 

Futhermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. 

Unfortunately I can’t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google “Antivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19”

Also, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they’re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they’re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. 

Sticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I’ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.

Edit: TL;DR— MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr."

Her reviews said she lived in a run down house, and when I found out she lived in Gary, Indiana, I knew it wasn’t going to be the best of living conditions. When I pulled up I could see a fan in the window, so I knew it was going to be hot as hell in there. I was sweating the whole time.Also there were plants growing in the gutters so I kind of judged her on that too. The inside of the house looked dilapidated, but what can you do when you’re poor. Due to the house being hot, I could smell a very strong “ass” smell when I was fucking her from the back, and I didn’t like that. From now on I will only see escorts that host out of hotels because it won’t be hot. The bare head felt pretty good, I had to stop her before I came because I wanted some pussy too LOL. The smell kind of fucked up the mood though, and that was one of the reasons why it took me longer to nut. Also I’m starting to dislike overweight women, so that also played a factor. My hands still smell like ass even though I washed my hands with her Dawn dish soap. And that’s kind of irritating. In conclusion... I won’t be coming out here again. It’s too damn hot, and it’s also farther out than other escorts for a worse level of service. She doesn’t like to ride a dick and only rode me for less than a minute. I might just stick with the Asian women from now on. I definitely could’ve use that $90 for some other things that I have to take care of in my life. I wish I would’ve just beat my meat...."

Essentially what he’s saying is when Tesla squeezes it squeezes way more early on in the week than later on. Since gamma goes to 0 for OTM calls as time passes by this makes sense. So buyers later on in the week buy into MMs selling (think of GEX), which makes it far less likely to gap.

In the short term assuming he has the political capital for it (unlikely) I could see alot of educational companies rallying (chegg, etc). 

Long term it's a bit of an issue because wiping out debt and free college can't happen without tax increases. Either you pass a wealth tax and funnel those funds into schools or standard tax increases across the board. But also if you have more college educated people then I can see that depressing wages even more on the mid to high skill level.

I don't see this ending well for retail. You can sideload people into retirement plans through inertia (opt-out) but without real GDP growth I don't see how you can guarantee 6-7 percent returns. Also if they lock up their $$$ and don't spend it that means theres less in the market anyways."

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SP-SPF/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SP-SPF/)

Bank stocks are trading at their 10 March 2020 levels. And then I was reading Uniform Bank Performance reports for all the banks.

>JPMorgan Chase had **$2.9 trillion exposure** in off-balance sheet items versus $2.3 trillion on its balance sheet with **$246 billion in equity capital**. That information comes directly from JPMorgan Chase’s [Uniform Bank Performance Report](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=852218&peerGroupType=&supplemental=) for December 31, 2019 at the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Its off-balance sheet “mysterious” items marked simply “other,” total to a whopping $737.5 billion – that’s almost three-quarters of an undefined $1 trillion at the largest bank in the U.S.  
>  
>Then there is Bank of America. It has $1.85 trillion in assets on its balance sheet and equity capital of **$212 billion**. But [off its balance sheet it has another $1.5 trillion](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=480228&peerGroupType=&supplemental=). Its “other” items listed off its balance sheet total to **$450.9 billion**.

was only 2 trade with 2 contract each but given premium levels it was enough as i lost out on both calls and puts by being on the wrong side of both trades.

spent the rest of the day, 80+ trades later to scalp back to break-even. thanks partly to WMT's news i guess.

## Daily News

* Walmart *announces* service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc.
* U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO)
* Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011

## Bear Day Reflection

* Airlines seeking “bailout” loan from government. Bookings have dropped due to Covid spikes. Covid-week stocks (airlines, cruises, casinos) struggles today.
* Covid deaths rose from 220 yesterday to 330 today. The “lag” may catch up.

### Spy 300 Tomorrow

## Bull Day Reflection

* Trump expressed need for 2nd stimulus checks by August.
* Walmart shows large businesses can adapt to coronavirus times.
* Let’s be honest, 5 straight days of .5%+ for SPY was a record and a fall down makes sense.

### Spy 318 Tomorrow

Edit: announces, not launches service."

2020-07-07 20:15:38,GnarlyPounderWoo,12,"Alright I read the Vox article about Walmart+ I’m on the phone so formatting gonna be shit and I’ll make it real simple.

What is it: Walmart+ is a $100 a year subscription services that grants subscribers same-day grocery delivery, reserve delivery, fast checkouts, early access to deals, gas discounts at WMT gas stations and etc. Even plans for a WMT+ video app in the future.

When? Sometime this month apparently.

Is this an opportunity? Walmart current online e-retail is only 1/8 the size of amazon. As it stands Walmart is valued at 337b and Amazon 1.5t. Customer satisfaction in amazon is down from 74% to 54% due to prolonged waits during covid.

Concerns? Well certain components and moves Walmart is making will put people out of work and the question is during a time of hardship who wants to add another $100 a year subscription to their fees.
IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT WILL LAUNCH NATIONALLY OR REGIONALLY.

There I saved you 5 boobless minutes.
