Dow inclusion stocks to buy calls on:

$HON (Honeywell) wait for profit taking. Calls when it dips to $160. Hold until 167.  

$AMGN (Amagen) wait for profit taking. Calls when it goes down to 242. Hold until 245.  

EDIT: Some of those calls might just run and not dip.

$AAPLE. Apple will run today to reorganizing Dow. Balls deep in Calls.  

Down the road look at $XOM $RTX and $PFE for overreaction plays. But doubt they coming back today.  

Have not looked closely enough at $TSLA yet, to see where it will bounce, but once it does, Calls like a motherfucker."
