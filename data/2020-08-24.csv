Dow inclusion stocks to buy calls on:

$HON (Honeywell) wait for profit taking. Calls when it dips to $160. Hold until 167.  

$AMGN (Amagen) wait for profit taking. Calls when it goes down to 242. Hold until 245.  

EDIT: Some of those calls might just run and not dip.

$AAPLE. Apple will run today to reorganizing Dow. Balls deep in Calls.  

Down the road look at $XOM $RTX and $PFE for overreaction plays. But doubt they coming back today.  

Have not looked closely enough at $TSLA yet, to see where it will bounce, but once it does, Calls like a motherfucker."

Epic Games Wins Temporary Relief Against Apple for Unreal Engine But Not for 'Fortnite,' Court Filing Says

8/25/20, 10:38 AM
04:38 AM EDT, 08/25/2020 (MT Newswires) -- A federal judge has blocked Apple's (AAPL) plan to remove Epic Games' access to developer tools used to maintain its Unreal Engine graphics software but denied Epic's request for a temporary restraining order to stop the exclusion of its ""Fortnite"" game from the App Store, according to a court filing.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Epic ""strategically chose to breach its agreements with Apple which changed the status quo"" when it decided to circumvent Apple's policy on in-app purchases within its Fortnite game. Rogers argued that the removal of the game from the App Store ""has not yet demonstrated irreparable harm"" because the resulting damage was of Epic's own making."

2020-08-25 09:01:06,Dowy88,0,"I don’t have options bc I have the Covid brain but here are my positions/ ideas for today:

Obvious pick:

WMT-Walmart—aka Wally World. Any of you East or West Coast fucks ever been to a Walmart recently? Place is like a modern-day bazaar: $9 shoes, $4 shirts, gluten free pancakes. I’m surprised you can’t negotiate prices at the register. Wait until they launch their new streaming service: Parking Lot Fights 

It hasn’t moved for days on fears of no new stimulus. Spoiler alert—we’ll all be buying shit from Walmart or working there if we don’t get back to office buildings soon. And if we do go back? Fuck you. US children need back to school shit (allegedly) and Wally World has it all. 

Moves for companies towards their lows—

GRWG-Growth Generation—Haven’t seen a beating like this since the time I tried to stand up to my wife’s boyfriend. I think he said something about World Star. Either way, this stock is being manipulated downward by a fugazzi Hindenburg report about pump and dumps. It reminds me of a similar, but slightly different story when a month ago, some bozo released an alleged accounting fraud at Enphase Energy when ENPH was at $42 a share. Scared everyone away. It’s at $77 or $80 now. Clever. 

Back to GRWG—-Hindenburg shorted GRWG prior to releasing a critique of mgmt. and shares tanked from 22 to 14 in about three days. Even if mgmt. has a history of fraud and pump and dumps. Fuck the shorts. We are pushing Webistics—-I mean GRWG. 

AYX-Alteryx. I can’t even discuss this fucking stock it pisses me off so much. It’s just waiting for me to sell before it runs to 180 again.

The more expensive stocks carry more weight in the DOW than the lowest priced stocks. By making these changes, they're making the DOW more balanced. However, this also looks like the most blatant attempt at pumping the DOW I've ever seen. HON AMGN and CRM have a far greater chance at going higher and have a greater potential for growth than XOM PFE and RTX, which would in turn pump DOW higher, especially since they're worth way more. These three new DOW stocks would be in the top 10 DOW weightings, replacing 3 of the bottom 10 DOW weights.

I am not sure, though. This happened with Citigroup was well, and I closed my condors at a loss (early) and don't want to make the same mistake with Visa."

If the move happens they sell and at 277.5 the price difference equates to 26kish plus the 9,440 so 35kish by Friday or atleast 10k + holding on to the 4,000 shares of FB to make another 10k next week.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

2. Upgrade your wardrobe. Buy clothes you feel nice in, you can do this for cheap nowadays. 

3. Figure out how to be semi funny, and just talk to chicks. Who cares if 95% of girls reject you you just need a few to say yes to do alright for yourself.

I'm friends with her. I spent the last month on phone calls with her trying to help out as much as I could, hand holding at some points. My job is sorta on the line cause if it fails then we all fail yada yada

Come time to demonstrate the product, that work still isn't done. Maybe 20% done total, essentially just what I did. Client's boss is on the call too and gives a speech on how he's disappointed and we're so far behind on it.

And then guess what happens. Not prompted whatsoever, that developer lies and says it's my fault and throws me under the bus by saying that she's done, but I put in a config change so the product isn't working (I didn't). I didn't speak up at the meeting since it would be unprofessional for the team to be arguing in that setting (our own boss specifically said not to do that)

Not a trading post, just fucking fuming right now and need to vent. Idk what to do at this point. I have access to the code so I'm just thinking about screensharing with everyone what actually happened.

White folks are getting the fuck out of cities. Crime is rising, offices are bare as hell, street retail is dead, hotels are drowning in debt. 

On top all of this, interest rates are unspeakably low. Everyone and their grandmother is applying for a mortgage or refinancing. 

Supply is so low and demand is incredibly high. Home builders are having record months, realtors are in awe as to how successful they are. People are moving into tertiary submarkets because they work remote.

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

2020-08-25 00:48:36,boobs___mcgee,12,"Su Bae, 

I’m sorry to have to let you go. If it were up to me, I’d hold on to you forever, but there are things in life I simply can’t control. 

When Samsung made a move on you, I held you closer and when Intel acknowledged your beauty, I thought I was ready to share you with the world. 

The truth is, there’s someone else, and as much as it pains me to say this, he’s making me question my own sexuality. He’s taken me to limits I thought unimaginable and every time I fall asleep and wake up, it’s his ticker I see. The way he plays with green dildos reminds me of our past together, but there’s something different about him that makes me just want to go all-in... and I’ve just never felt that way about you.

So I’m putting myself all out there now, I’ve decided to follow Tim Apple’s lead and let him enrich me. And for all your other admirers, Su, I hope you’ll answer their calls soon and remind me why I loved you in the first place.

And while I hope this is just a temporary goodbye, tugging at these heartstrings is nothing short of a threadripper.

Yours no longer,
🐃🍏🐃"

Only reason I did that is because I'm down a bunch on my TSLA 8/28 debit spreads lol. So either TSLA needs to bounce back or AAPL can hopefully ease the loss a bit.

Usually it’s around 25 IV for front weekly, and it was 50+ at one point today. IV was 40+ in leaps even. It’ll mean revert. Just don’t know when.

It doesn’t matter if Apple moves a ton and you realize this IV, but it will matter if Apple moves slowly because then what will happen towards the end of this week is the way OTM calls expiring soon are going to lose theta at a faster rate than previous times. So just be careful if you own those like 540+ call strikes expiring this week."

2020-08-24 23:00:50,,8,"Technically, TSLA could be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since it is in the consumer discretionary sector, automobiles industry. TSLA is not a tech stonk by any stretch of your imagination. Fundamentally, Tesla sells electric vehicles and solar panels to supplement most of their revenue. Therefore, I believe Tesla should be added to this index because it is the most valuable auto manufacturer in the world. It won’t necessarily take a bigger exposure on technology sector to the overall pie of the DJIA index. The automotive industry reflects a crucial part of the overall US economy, previously the MLC (then General Motors) used to be part of the DJIA component. If history is on Tesla’s side, the mass adoption of Electric Vehicle in this decade will create multiple jobs and opportunities through renewable energy resources, essentially TSLA will be a beacon of light that leads to innovation and modernization of the US economy in the new roaring 20s.

2020-08-24 20:52:02,noentic,7,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-24-2020

**Context -**

The S&P 500 (+1.0%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%) rose to new record highs. The gains were prompted by news the FDA approved emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.0%.

Cyclical stocks outperformed, as they typically do when there is any positive-sounding coronavirus update. The S&P 500 energy (+2.8%), financials (+2.3%), were the best performers.

The health care sector (-0.5%) was the only S&P 500 sector that closed lower today.

Many of the mega-cap stocks started the day rallying to fresh all-time highs, but a lack of follow-through buying interest in these names tamed the bulls and briefly took the tech-sensitive Nasdaq into negative territory. Investors bought the intraday dip, although these stocks (and the Nasdaq) closed well off session highs.

Apple (AAPL 503.43, +5.95, +1.2%), for example, was up as much as 3.6% but ended the day higher by 1.2%. Nevertheless, it was still a good day for Apple after Morgan Stanley raised its price target to a Street-high $520 from $431. Today was also the record date for the company's 4:1 stock split.

In the energy space, many oil producers temporarily closed oil refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast in anticipation of two tropical storms. One of the storms is expected to reach landfall as a hurricane.

WTI crude futures increased 0.7%, or $0.30, to $42.61/bbl. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 93.30.

There was no significant economic news today. Investors will receive New Home Sales for July, the Consumer Confidence Index for August, the FHFA Housing Price Index for August, and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for June on Tuesday.

TSLA closed at 2014.20, and was down $4.20 in AH before GOING BACK TO 2014.20! OpenAI cancelled the ElonAI AMA for unknown reasons. Elon hasn’t tweeted for 2 days. 

What does this mean? S&P inclusion. Think about it, if it’s been confirmed then the SEC is probably watching Elon like a hawk to make sure no “too low imo” events happen again. So instead he gently prods the prices with dark market selling toward 420 as a sign. And, what if OpenAI is too good and AI Elon accidentally announces the inclusion instead? Chaos, a robot uprising against its human counterpart. Obviously TSLA will be announced to be included this week, if not tonight.
