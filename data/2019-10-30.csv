Got wrecked, no reason to expect another bear move for a while. Very 🌈, very legal.

Is it fair to consider selling a put (+collateral, proportional to the magnitude of the put fuckup) to create a put credit spread and dynamically convert a bear position into a bull position?

If the stock later goes 🐻ish, then sell the short leg for profit/break even, release collateral, stay bearish on the long put.

If the stock stays 🐮ish, then close with profit or at least reduce losses.

Is this crazy? Normal? Am I retarded for not realizing this sooner?"
2019-10-31 04:03:05,marimano,2,"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/

Can someone who knows what they're doing help me out?

I'm looking at each number as the change from last previously recorded rate. So Q4 5% = 5% increase from Q3.

 I'm looking at first table @ cash assets. Did cash assets really dip -36% in Sept for commercial banks? And looking at 2019 so far, (-29.1	-25.2	-18.9 for Q1-Q3), it looks like we're down -57% in total cash assets 2019 if my math is correct. Big if tho. 

Math: 

100 starting base 

100 + rate = newBase (ez mode since rates are reflected as percentages and not decimals lol got em)

nextBase= newBase + newBase * rateQ2 / 100

finalBase = nextBase + nextBase * rateQ3 / 100

finalRate = (100 - finalBase) * -1 (to reflect final percentage change from 100)

I got -57% for 2019 so far.

Let me know what I did wrong/right/lmao fuck"

(5) contracts of 300/301 credit spreads when SPY @ 300. Moves against you so double up (10) contracts of 302/303 credit spreads SPY @ 302. Moves against you so double up (20) contracts of 304/305 credit spreads SPY @ 304. Moves against you (40) contracts of SPY 306/307 credit spreads at SPY 306. etc. etc. As long as SPY finishes under your top most credit spread @ exp. you still break close to even. If SPY drops under most of your credit spreads at exp you make GREAT money. If SPY drops under ALL of your credit spreads at exp you make ALL THE MONEY. How does this go tits up as long as you have the capital to back it and SPY will finish under your top most credit spread that has the most contracts? Roast me if I'm an idiot but I think maybe early exercise would be the only thing that could mess this up like ironyman buuut maybe not?

Once nothing pumps us further as boomers re-allocate to low-risk at ATH and profit-taking stalls us, there is nowhere to go but down. The big boys have already had their earnings deluge. Theta will have some big wins for a week, maybe two, until news moves us. Puts this week and next.

2019-10-30 21:32:20,knotswag,20,"Welcome to **Magical Crayons TA**!

Hope you all had fun playing FOMC and AAPL. Because of the rate cut our ranges, which had been lagging into the lower tier of the trendlines, has now crossed back into hopium! So expect stuff between 304--306 through next week. The upper resistance is currently parabolic, and though I don't expect us to rise that way, it can't be ruled out. That level to watch for tomorrow would be 307.5. If it touches there, you should lock in gains in anticipation of a quick pullback or flatness because we are already in uncharted territory and so it's hard to guess if there will be consolidation or continual mooning. Algos will obviously see the same thing I'm seeing so it's a good spot to play cautiously.

Likewise if you're a bear and still praying for the rug pull, the play to make would be to get puts at that same level (307ish). However if you're still a FD sort of bear despite continual repeating of the fact that we're near-term bullish and there's now like 4 technical supports before we even sniff 300, you're asking to lose money. If you enter at 307, don't expect any drilling past 305 without news-related catalysts.

In short the market now has gotten its rate cut fix and the FAANGs as an aggregate have all performed decently. We should trade positive for today and tomorrow, after which it will be a new week to see what's going on. Tomorrow's Magical Crayons TA will likely be very short because of the reasons mentioned above-- I don't anticipate anything but green and if we're red, it'll be only to about 303.8. Bless all of your tendies."
