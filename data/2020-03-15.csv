Meanwhile the fed and the president have no fucking idea what's going on, and people are still going out to bars and restaurants. 

The human toll here will be high. I think people expect us to get away unscathed for some reason. The homeless population is going to *suffer* . You think people will be buying stocks when people start dropping dead on the sidewalk? On the bus? No sir. Bottom is even lower than I previously thought. 239 retest is in order at the moment. 200 might break this month or next, dont @ me

Edit: not fearmongering, just keeping it real. Between the data we've seen from other countries, vs how we know our government is/ isn't handling it, and what we know about our own population and the current case count, it's not hard to extrapolate here. That being said, when we come back online when this is all said and done, we will bounce pretty fast I'd assume. The fed will figure out some black magic financial fuckery, like always.

That there ain't one gosh darn part you can beat,

your had no part in WSB, your hands are too weak,

Discussion: With reserve requirements being slashed, when do we think this will affect the market? Obviously this is going to free up *absolutely fucking stupid and obscene* levels of capital, which theoretically should help this liquidity problem that's been rumbling, right? Not necessarily to say it'll help markets directly, but the fed has been doing repo's for six fucking months to no avail. Is it the medicine we need or just another feelgood drug?

I think the release said effective 3/26? I'd say it depends on when the paper is signed. Banks definitely would not want to jump the gun on liquidating their reserve even with fed promises. Even then, it would be fucking retarded of the banks to use them on securities. Is it just to prop up credit servicing in the states? Obviously the global economy is fucked but if we can keep the US afloat then the world should follow - in the Fed's eyes, I think. I'm still short.

/r/all gains look just like gonorrhea, mine so high you can't see 'em,

/r/all feels like they can mimic, yet hands so weak they get hysteric,

/r/all will go underground, but come on and try to follow the trail,

I made so much money, and then Shkreli went to jail,

Made so many gains, I'm never going to fail,

/r/all said let's try to do a u/WSBGod and take our chances or three,

I heard you gotta sell it all and take the whammy,

Before /r/all it was so free, gains so hard with drum tight DD,

That there ain't one gosh darn part you can beat,

your had no part in WSB, your hands are too weak,

Know what God said when he made the first rainbow?,

You're going to throw gold at the end, but you're too late for the intro,

**Ughhhhh, but now I'm just having fun with it,**

**I know that /r/all teenagers are gonna take a hard loss,**

I laugh in my head,

Cause I bet that despite your downvote you're looking back like a pillar of salt,

The market gonna flip the script on your ass and machete you on the spike,

2020-03-16 05:11:36,GypsyPunk,8,"So, I wrote this reply to someone talking up long straddles which I do think is a decent move still for at least 5 more trading days. Possibly 10. Even though I hate 90% of you all I don't think anyone deserves to lose money for simply wanting a less stressful life. Take it for what you will, try to argue with it if you want, but I work in a math heavy field and I don't think people know the complexities behind how much of that math is working against them as patterns because more consistent. 

**Hint: We are already 3 weeks into a consistency pattern. You will not be ahead of the math.**

**Here is what I wrote in hopes to help some of you who see this. P.S. Didn't edit & again, drunk.** 

I think long straddles are fine if you don't hold them to expiry. You have to understand how the Vix works. It prices in predicted movement 30 days, 60 days and 90 days out and how much the price moves away from that standard deviation is the +/- of the VIX. I think we are at the tail end of seeing Vix in the 60s-70s+ given the insanely fast drops almost 30 days ago.

Doing long Straddles seems like the *bad* move this week as the Vix gets closer to a price prediction that is far away from above SPX 3300+. Option premiums are about to start dwindling down imo.

If you have the capital to do ""long"" straddles 2 or 3 weeks out then sell either side at *least* a week before expiry when you are comfortably in the green.

Don't diamond hands your way into minimizing gains or taking potential losses because there is more math behind what's going on than people realize. The gold rush is gonna end at some point and it's not far off."

We can't be consumed by our petty bull/bear differences anymore.  We will be united in our common tendie interests.    


Perhaps it's fate that today is the day after the Fed started QE, and you will once again be fighting for our tendies, not from the fed, theta, or gay mods, but from blowing up your accounts.  We're fighting for our right to profit, to get tendies.  


And should we win the day, the 16th of March will no longer be known as the day before the rates dropped to 0 and QE was started, but as the day when WSB declared in one voice:  


""We will not blow up our accounts quietly into the close.  We will not vanish without madly purchasing FD's.  We are going to actually make money for once!  Our accounts will survive!  Today, we celebrate our Tendies Day!"""

>On Friday, the central bank announced it would cut the amount of cash banks need to hold as reserves by 50 basis points, injecting around 550 billion yuan ($78.6 billion) into the economy. The RRR cut took effect on Monday.

>The PBOC also said it would take other measures to lower borrowing costs to protect the economy that has been damaged by the coronavirus outbreak.

>It comes as fresh data from China today showed the economy has been hit harder than expected by the coronavirus outbreak.

Now it happened again and the rates been cut the dollar is week, all this tells me that its just a great entry. Timing is crucial with Gold it is very difficult to trade with options since it mostly moves sharply and just swings day to day which hurts options, but timing is everything.

If nothing else, this crisis has shown me how useless Seeking Alpha is.  That guy is by no means unique; many others on that site are still pumping various stocks from airlines to energy to tech to whatever.  Sometimes, you wonder if these people either (1) have unlimited money or (2) just talk BS and never actually make trades.  I suspect the latter."

> Mortgage rates had fallen to a record low two weeks ago, but a flood of refinance applications overwhelmed lenders and caused investors in mortgage-backed bonds to back off. That, in turn, caused mortgage rates to jump more than 50 basis points in one day and hit their January high by the end of last week. The Fed‚Äôs move will likely reverse that course yet again.

I MISUNDERSTOOD THE NEWS, BUT THE EFFECT I THINK IS GOING TO BE THE SAME. Heres the update, after better reading -


NEWS:
India imposed a withdrawal limit on YES BANK accounts that will be lifted effectively March 18th 6PM IST

India bailed out YES BANK earlier last week with their biggest bail out ever.

This caused banking deposits in general in india to drop to lowest levels. 

They expect this panic to continue, once the withdrawal limits are taken off on 18th.

You can find the full statement from United Airlines here, but these are a few of the numbers that led to the decision to reduce flight capacity by half for April and May and cut corporate officers‚Äô salaries by 50%

As the leaders of the 100,000 people of United, we feel a deep obligation to each of you to run our company in a way that protects you ‚Äì and your ability to provide for your family at home.

...

We want to share some numbers to help you understand just how bad the impact of the coronavirus has been on our business. As you know, March is typically our busiest month of the year. But this year, in just the first two weeks of March, we have welcomed more than one million fewer customers on board our aircraft than the same period last year. We‚Äôre also currently projecting that revenue in March will be $1.5 billion lower than last March."

They're doing a soft quarantine in stages to make it seem like these were voluntary choices and not top-down directives.

**GET READY FOR FACTS Y'ALL**

Infectious Disease is in a bull market, but I'm bearish on Covid-19. It's an effect of an overblown media circus and social media mouth breathers (yes, *you*) causing mass hysteria and a topic that can't be dropped by anyone.

Had you been watching flu cases every day from October 1, 2019 to March, 07 2019 you'd be seeing freaking out were it called by any other name. The accumulated death total by the end of the year for the Flu in America alone is still exceeding Covid-19 at an amazing rate. Globally, flu is beating the fuck out of it.

**Flu vs. Covid-19:**

* CDC estimates that, from October 1, 2019, through March 7, 2020: 22,000-55,000 people have died ***in the United States*** from the flu. It is on track to kill thousands more with a death rate running rampant globally. ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm))
* There are only **3,043** known cases of Covid-19 ([Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/)) in the United States vs. over 100,000 known cases of influenza from October 1, 2019 through March 7, 2020 ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm))
* From October 1, 2019 to March 2020 Covid-19 has killed roughly 5,973 people ([Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/))
* As of March 7, 2020 - Flu is at a high level of activity in roughly 39 states ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIActivityMap))
* Average Age in Italy is 45.4 with a min-max range of 43-49.1 years old by region. It is the oldest population in Europe. ([Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/569187/average-age-of-the-population-in-italy-by-region/))
* In Flu Season 2013 to 2017, 68,000 deaths were attributable to influenza epidemics in the study period (**Simplistically \~13,600 per year**) . The observed excess of deaths is not completely unexpected, given the high number of fragile very old subjects living in Italy ([Source](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-infectious-diseases))
* Deaths in Italy as of now March 15th, 2020 from Covid-19: **1,441** ([Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries))
* Flu has a ***higher*** death rate for anyone under 65 than Covid-19 so far. ([Covid Death Rate](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) vs. [2018-2019 Death Rate](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html))"

2020-03-16 02:02:22,pssk1988,1,"Hi xoxo, 

We wanted to reach out to you in the midst of what we know to be historic and volatile market conditions, due in part to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In light of recent drops in the S&P 500, there have been market-wide trading halts, triggered by mechanisms put in place by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Market-wide trading halts are designed to help stabilize the financial markets during volatile periods. Halts are issued by US equities, options, and futures exchanges and can last 15 minutes or the remainder of the trading day. 

Here are some good things to know if another trading halt occurs: 
Can I trade during a market-wide halt? You can place new orders during a halt, but they will not be processed until the halt is over and the market reopens. Please note that market orders held or placed during a halt may fill at a very different price once trading resumes.

Can I use Robinhood during a halt? Yes, you will still be able to view your positions, read your newsfeed, and contact support through your Robinhood app.
To learn more about circuit breakers, trading halts, and how they may affect your experience on Robinhood, please read our latest Help Center article. 

As always, thank you for being a Robinhood customer. 

Sincerely, 
The Robinhood Team"

Also seems some people have poor reading comprehension and seem to think it means they will close the markets. I am not getting that idea after reading it. 

Email:



""We wanted to reach out to you in the midst of what we know to be historic and volatile market conditions, due in part to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In light of recent drops in the S&P 500, there have been market-wide trading halts, triggered by mechanisms put in place by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Market-wide trading halts are designed to help stabilize the financial markets during volatile periods. Halts are issued by US equities, options, and futures exchanges and can last 15 minutes or the remainder of the trading day. 

Here are some good things to know if another trading halt occurs: 

Can I trade during a market-wide halt? You can place new orders during a halt, but they will not be processed until the halt is over and the market reopens. Please note that market orders held or placed during a halt may fill at a very different price once trading resumes.


Can I use Robinhood during a halt? Yes, you will still be able to view your positions, read your newsfeed, and contact support through your Robinhood app.

To learn more about circuit breakers, trading halts, and how they may affect your experience on Robinhood, please read our latest Help Center article."""

2020-03-16 01:34:24,rand0mprecisi0n,4,"Updated CDC Guidance: 

""Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.

Therefore, CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers (whether groups or individuals) cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States.

Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing.¬† When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.

This recommendation does not apply to the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses. This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus.¬† This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.""

The Greatest of Down Days. Sung to the tune of [""The Greatest Adventure""](https://youtu.be/JAYoLyO5hCs) from the animated movie The Hobbit.

The greatest of down days is what lies ahead üêª

The futures tomorrow are going to be red üìâ


The chances the contracts are all yours to make ü§ë

The tendies of your life are in your hands to bake. üçó

The boomer remover is here if you're old üßì

Let go of the SPY shares your wife üë© makes you hold

Though joining the üêª gang can make you turn üåà

It's time you stop thinking, buy puts every day.

A man who's in bull gang üêÇ, autistic, naive

Who thinks that the virus is just make believeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Will never know tendies üçó

Will never know gains üìà

Don't jump out the window

Just load puts again

The greatest of down days is what lies ahead üêª

The futures tomorrow are going to be red üìâ

The chances the contracts are all yours to make ü§ë

The tendies of your life are in your hands to bake. üçó

2020-03-16 01:23:05,WestmontOG07,16,"First, I view this move by the FED today and the government (on Friday) as HUGE long term positives for the bulls. I bought the following CALLS on Friday, and plan to hold:

5 LYB Jan 15th 2021 45 at $6.37

20 XOM July 17 2020 40 at $3.64 - plan to close this one in the week ahead if we get a pop. (I bought it after I heard the president talk about buying some of the cheap oil in the market and filling up our coffers)

5 XOM Oct 16th 2020 45 at $4.67. (May hold on to this one longer term as I believe we will see a bounce in oil in the coming months)

Heavily considering buying July Puts on the SPY at the $200 range and Apple at the $225 range as well.

My positions are fluid and are aimed, generally speaking and specifically on the PUT side, to give me downside protection on the nearly $600,000 I have in long positions.

Nervous times, generally speaking, but, with a longer term horizon, likely 12 months, in mind, I believe we have MANY moats that will pull us out of this thing quicker and more robustly than we have seen in the previous bear markets--- lower oil prices, VERY low interest rates, a pro business FED and US GOVT AND, potentially most importantly, PENT up demand that will be fully unleased with a ripe garden of money, loans and oil that are there for the taking!

While I lose about $30,000, give or take, per 2,000 point down day, I also add to positions for the long term, specifically, in Google, Amazon, Facebook, CVS, Cisco, QCOM, Pfizer and SWKS.

I wish everyone the best of luck and will say, generally speaking, be greedy when others are fearful.

I believe we are DAMN close to having a recession AND a corona virus effect fully priced into the market, outside of Apple, which I believe has significantly more downside."

2020-03-16 01:15:12,reddituseranyonymous,-8,"I have etrade and newish to options, preferring to buy and hold individual stocks and some VTSAX. I sold all my stocks 2 weeks ago (kept VTSAX) Starting to play with options. Would like to make a few tendies since my VTSAX is getting punched in the face. I got 22+ years to retirement so I'm not worried, but would love to bandage my wounds with some tendies.

Etrade is suggesting Long PUT SPY April 17, 272 - it's showing me a $2500 bet is a max loss of $1892 and a Gain of $25,308. $10,000 bet has a max loss of $9,431 gain of $126,569

Um isnt the S&P already well under 2700? Why would it offer this to me as a trade? This should be super expensive because it should be printing money faster than a 2 year old scribbles.

2020-03-16 01:11:46,canadian2020,42,"My thoughts on tomorrow from a Canuck stuck on this bald eagle:

1. Market opens in the red and S&P 500 drops 7% by 10:00 am hitting the first circuit breaker resulting in 15 min halt in trading. This is followed by another 6% drop by Noon resulting in another 15 minute halt. We end the day with  \~18% decline close to the third circuit breaker (20% decline for the day). As bear gang I will continue to c hold my SPY puts. I have SPY $240p 3/27. I suspect the market will drop 40% from the peak before the whole stock market is halted for 2 weeks  by Donnie.
2. If you can right at market open get  $TVIX, $VXX,$UVXY, $SQQQ and ride it down and sell before end of the day.
3. Near market close and at the trough for the day buy far out LEAP calls on &SPY to 2021, 2022.
4. I suspect the market will shutdown by friday. Mark my words. If I was donnie that is what I would do to prevent things from getting of hand.
5. US positive cases for COVID-19 will hit 10 0000 in 7 days.
6. In 10 days hospitals will be at capacity
7. Buy supplies to last you and your family for four weeks. I was watching the White house meeting today and they kept on repeating how the supply chain will keep food at the grocery stores. If this is similar to their promise to provide millions of tests last week - you decide for yourself.
8. Enjoy the qurantine. Americans deserve a vacation from their work. Spend time with your SO, kids, hobbies, and pets. Spin this in a positive direction. Ride the market both ways - bear/bull Gang  and get those tendies!

>Alright, for those that believe in TA, I have some DD to share.  
>  
>Before we begin, my current position are /ES shorts @ 2641.25. Which is right around the level where /ES closed at Friday.  
>  
>I took the position because we are still bearish on the 4-hour chart. During the last couple of weeks, we haven't yet broken out to any pattern that would point towards recovery.  
>  
>Let's take a look at this:  
>  
>[https://i.imgur.com/5WA1BzG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5WA1BzG.jpg)  
>  
>We have three things marked out on the chart:  
>  
>Horizontal S/R: Everytime we broke down to new lows, we would rally to previous lows before getting rejected. Well, the Friday rally brought us right back to prior lows. So the bulls have to work extra hard to break out of this bearish pattern.  
>  
>Diagonal S/R: So not only is the current price at a horizontal resistance, but it is also at a diagonal/trendline resistance.  
>  
>Rally Count: I have the rallies marked by %, and it's not for TA, but just to depict the size of the rallies. Friday's rally was the largest we've seen from the bottom to the prior low, but what contributed to it was the Thursday evening session that pushed ES to over -3% down before rallying hardcore.  
>  
>Recap: In my opinion, there will not be another""relief"" rally for S&P on Monday. The only way for S&P to push past two important resistance levels is with really positive news. On the other hand, if we do push out the resistance on Monday, then it would be wise to close your short/put positions for a loss since we would now be bullish on the 4-hour.  
>  
>TLDR: The ball is still in bear's court. If the bulls see a rally on Monday, they've finally broken out of a downtrend ever since Feb 23.

Here we are Sunday night, with the early announcement of a Fed Cut to 0%, and the announcing to the QE program. Even with those two things, the index futures managed to limit down within 15 minutes of open. 

The trend in the chart above continues to be respected, and at this point, we should be testing the lows relatively soon.

Updated chart:

 [https://i.imgur.com/ZGbj9OJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZGbj9OJ.jpg) 

There are two levels that I am looking at for taking profit, @ 2477 & @ 2379.

If you're looking for a quick long play, then wait for the bottom touch. I don't expect for us to cut through it instantly, if anything, we'll see a bounce of 100 points before retesting and breaking through."

2020-03-16 00:56:49,FredWeedMax,30,"With the fed cutting interest rates in a panic move we'll surely see my scenario unfold but on a worse version because of the sheer panic this will cause

the fed is basically spelling it out for all the retards in the back :

>RECESSION IS COMING

So we open session at 2565 and drill to circuit breaker by 9:35

Once market reopens at 9:50 and we're at 2525 we continue to drill until the market finds a support.

Of course there's no fucking support yet as 2500 area is nothing special, we drill past that and look for the next  support areas which happen to be 2440. But this was POC wasn't that strong either so we drill past that onto 2400, if this doesn't hold either we're off to the second circuit breaker where i feel we could see a swing back up as those levels are quite ominous :

If we look at other majors we can see that NDX -13% is right at 7000, Dow -13% is ~20170, so basically 20K, Russel -13% is at 10500, SPX -13% is 2358

Unless we bounce at earlier support mentioned, we'll definitely swing at those levels since they're so significant. IMO we swing back to 2450 or so on tuesday, maybe even tomorrow after the sheer panic make us fall to -13% in full capitulation mode

TL;DR : we going for 2nd circuit breaker, if you buy puts after the -13% dump you're retarded"

That's literally the easiest way to highlight which time periods were when a recession occured. Look at a historical chart for federal reserve interest rates, every time the interest rate was incrementally cut down, a recession occured. It's used to free up the flow of money and to encourage spending so we move out of the recession.

This time we just plummeted from 1.25 down to 0.25, if not lower by the end of this. This honestly seems like the mother of all recessions if this keeps getting worse."

We wanted to reach out to you in the midst of what we know to be historic and volatile market conditions, due in part to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In light of recent drops in the S&P 500, there have been market-wide trading halts, triggered by mechanisms put in place by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Market-wide trading halts are designed to help stabilize the financial markets during volatile periods. Halts are issued by US equities, options, and futures exchanges and can last 15 minutes or the remainder of the trading day. 

Here are some good things to know if another trading halt occurs: 
Can I trade during a market-wide halt? You can place new orders during a halt, but they will not be processed until the halt is over and the market reopens. Please note that market orders held or placed during a halt may fill at a very different price once trading resumes.

Can I use Robinhood during a halt? Yes, you will still be able to view your positions, read your newsfeed, and contact support through your Robinhood app."

If you're thinking about buying a first home, you probably want to wait several months.  Asset prices like real estate collapse during a recession.  Speculators need to liquidate their investments (empty homes they're sitting on) so supply increases. At the same time, the climate of fear drives individuals with otherwise healthy finances to avoid making large purchases, thus reducing demand.

If you've recently borrowed big to buy a home, well what the fuck were you thinking?  You're going to be so very underwater on that mortgage, very soon."

Headlines would only get much worse for at least another month or two. As usual, Trump will try to slow the bleeding (dead cat bounces). Eventually, people will lose faith in his speech and friends/relatives getting sick/dying would mute his optimistic lies.

Don't forget that C19 is just getting started with many other countries that owe US banks a lot of money and many of these loans will default. What will the feds do then, cut .25%?

TLDR; sharp fall to market bottom (won't take many months like 08) and then flat for many months to come. Also, cheap houses available for sale next year."

Really demonstrates how much fear and uncertainty there is in the air right now, with regard to both the market and the coronapocalypse. We‚Äôve never had anything like this happen before (at least in living memory), in terms of either severity or kind. Worse yet, we don‚Äôt know what tomorrow or next week or the next year will have in store for us. For all we know, it could be something far more sinister, tragic and earth-shattering‚Äîeven more so than all that‚Äôs going on now.

After all, who knows if we‚Äôre on a journey to hell? Or, if we are doomed to be, that we can somehow make it back? Who knows if our efforts will be enough, or if they even matter at all?

*No one does.*

Instead, all we know is that *we don‚Äôt know*. We don‚Äôt have answers. We don‚Äôt have data. We don‚Äôt have past examples to follow, and we don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúright‚Äù choices are. We just know that we‚Äôre sailing in uncharted waters here, and that we‚Äôre anxious, doubtful, and maybe even terrified.

And so we sit and wait. And wait. And wait some more, all the while scared shitless that we might be dead by dawn. Still, we desperately hope that we‚Äôll somehow live to see another day, another trade, and another opportunity. And another. And another.

And honestly, that‚Äôs the best we can do‚Äîto stay the course and play the long game, to trust the process and have faith in progress, and to see that we might just be lucky enough to end up on the right side of risk.

So stay invested, lads. Don‚Äôt capitulate. Don‚Äôt panic sell. Not now. Not this time. Not even if Monday trips trips the 20% circuit breaker. We‚Äôve come this far, and we‚Äôre gonna make it through this one too. Somehow, we‚Äôre all gonna be okay."

I'm a physician and not a trump supporter but this hysteria is so overblown and the white house is actually not doing a terrible job.

2020-03-15 23:58:00,it2wi2000,7,"Tried to create a post on this with no luck

Thesis: overall trend still going down, think we have 10% - 20% downward room left before it's time to start buying for the long run. As we saw over the past two weeks, the gov't tried several things to stop the drilling (rate cut, repo, travel ban, another rate cut, teasing us with the stimulus package), and the only news that the market really reacted positively to was Trump's show on Friday of coordination with industry leaders to contain the spread.

I.e., if you are shorting the market, the news you need to really beware of is that related to vaccines / cures / gov't coordination / small biz support / containment success.

Think they are using a tactic of steady news (daily, multiple times a day) to tease the markets and keep us thinking that everything is going to be ok.. Look at the proof:- Pelosi pulled that shit Thursday night at 11:30pm ET, giving an update that the stimulus package negotiations with Mnuchin should clear House approval on Friday- Pelosi gave an update Friday afternoon that she would make sure it gets passed no matter what- Trump schedules his Friday announcement for 3pm to make the market think he is confident in his news enough to announce before market close, then comes out 30 minutes late ON THE DOT so he can control the narrative of the last 30 minutes of trading- Later, house announces that they passed the stimulus package, and that Senate may pass it as early as monday

Market clearly doesn't give a shit about FED actions, it is more focused on the stimulus package and efforts to respond to the virus. Watch out Monday / Tuesday for news of Senate passing the bill, it will cause a spike in the market (which you can ride if you choose)

But also be aware that this steady stream of 'positive' news will now be in full force. Expect minor updates on vaccine testing, cures coming from China, positive news on China supply chain being back up and running, economic impact on China during lockdown, and more Trump announcements with the ""virus taskforce"". I think the point is to keep the market up until they roll out testing as the weather gets warmer, to ""flatten the infection curve"".

**TL;DR: Steady stream of positive news will be in full gear to keep markets going sideways over the next two weeks as they stall testing in hopes for warmer weather. Look out for 'positive' virus containment / stimulus package related news in particular which we will now be seeing very regularly . Still have room left to go down overall. Monday open down, but lookout for news re: Senate approval on Monday / Tuesday, along with China industry sector performance news.**"

* Might sell a lil bit of my UBER 1/15/21 $28p to add to my puts on HYG"

2020-03-15 23:52:12,fancykevin00,9,"What I am doing now

If the market opens green, I will buy a few SPY put options and will sell then by 12:15pm if I am making money then I will immediately buy a few SPY calls and will sell them by no later than 12:45pm

# Why???

Look at the SPY chart:

Thursday March 12th 12:30pm to 12:45pm then 3:30pm to 3:45pm

That is when the Fed added liquidity to the market..continued into Friday and helped spike the market up even further

Tomorrow...watch the market spike from 12:30 to 12:45

# Here is what I did...(Proof at bottom of page)

What I am doing now is towards the bottom

Portfolio was $4K value

I have been reading about the Beer Virus since January on a daily basis for about 15-20 minutes

I ran across Moderna - MRNA on a Monday night 2/24/20 hours after they announced a possible vaccine that they just shipped to the Center of Infectious Diseases

I noticed it had not hit the main stream media yet, CNN, CNBC etc so I bought Call options on early Tuesday morning...sold a few days later

Portfolio Value: $10,500

I started reading and researching 1-2 hours a day

Ran across:

Inovio - INO - Calls (Bought one day sold the next)

AMC Theaters - AMC - Puts (Held a few days then sold)

Ceaser's- CZR - Puts $8 and $10

Carnival - CLL - Puts $15 - still holding

Kroger - KR - Puts $30 $28 $27 $26 $21 $20 - bought sold multiple times & still holding 90 contracts

Portfolio Value: $15k-$16k

Circuit Breaker Day 1

VXX - bought the day before Breaker and sold after

Circuit Breaker Day 2

Bought WWE $25 Puts (Bought right when market reopened looked up last Bid/Ask while halt and somehow it executed the trade .05 above the ask on Yahoo) rocketed up immediately

Current Portfolio Value: $27,929.14

Current Call Holdings:

Citigroup: $55C C$62.50 C$72.50 ALL with a 1/22/2022 EXP

GUSH: ETF C$1.00 1/15/2021 EXP

GLD: C$160 - 6/19/2020 EXP

Puts:

CCL - P$15 -4/17/20

KR - P$24 - 4/17/20

WMT - P$95 - 4/17/20

# The take away:

Read, Read, Read, Read, Read

If you have $25kBuy a basket of VERY long calls EXP in 2021 or 2022 and short puts - $10k worth total

If you think the market is going down, then buy 70%-80% Puts and the rest calls with the $10k

The calls are insurance incase the market swings the other way

You dont wake up in morning and start driving while planning to have a wrecking...investing in volatility is the same!

Average down if you have to until you get to $15k-$18k Max

ALWAYS keep some liquidity just in case, dont go all in unless you HAVE to

Stocks mostly go up over time - dont buy very short calls unless you plan to get out quickly or know something

Dont buy long VXX calls, they go down over time, about 1/2 their value in a year...it's an inverse of the market - if you dont know what that is...READ UP

Best of luck Everyone!

I'm waiting to see what's coming down the pike. Pence at today's presser: ""We'll have more broad-based recommendations for the American public tomorrow."" I think the Fed's early action today was all about getting ahead of whatever Pence is talking about. Probably severe restrictions on gathering and travel.

We are in a really bad spot economically. We have only seen the beginning of the economic chilling that's going to set in over the coming weeks and months. Lots of boomers are relying on 401k's. People need cash. Layoffs have begun. Corporate bankruptcies will begin.

That's not to even mention the pain coming for the medical system. So much is so fucked. The really smart money repositioned in January.

I'll be looking to scalp the volatility over the spring and summer while pumping the absolute fuck out of my 401k to take advantage of perhaps the best buying opportunity of my life."

The situation has PLENTY more room to go down.

I‚Äôd rather help someone understand my point of view rather than ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucked tomorrow‚Äù.

Friends who work in the health care system say it's a shit storm and it's going to get much worse. They're struggling now and we're nowhere near the peak. The media is underreporting deaths and cases.

This whole testing is available thing is bullshit. You can't really get tested unless you present severe symptoms (at least in my state). At that point it's too late. You're potentially carrying it for up to two weeks. People took it as a joke and this thing will most likely spread like wildfire. Give this another week or two.

I might provide an update on my situation later. Our fire department had potential exposure to COVID-19. We can't get tested. Members who had direct patient contact were told to self-quarantine and wait for symptoms to present to get tested."

Gov. Newsom about to go live about current status of California. Please use this for discussion.

Edit:

- Rolling out mobile testing centers and test kits.

- ‚Äú47,000‚Äù hospital beds, ‚Äú11,500‚Äù ICU beds, ‚Äú7500‚Äù ventilators (900 more on their way)

- 5.3mil Californians over 65 - prioritizing age, pre existing conditions, homeless 

- requesting home isolation of all individuals over 65 and with preexisting conditions.

- task force focusing on food, water and the workforce.

- ‚Äúlean in and own this moment‚Äù 

- requesting all ‚Äúnon essential‚Äù businesses - winery, bars, breweries, nightclubs to CLOSE. Not a law but an expectation. Currently it‚Äôs ‚Äúguidance‚Äù and are not using ‚Äúmartial law‚Äù.

- restaurants to stay open under different rules. ‚ÄúReduce occupancy by half‚Äù. ‚Äúnot concerned‚Äù about enforcement because businesses are already making changes

- 108k unsheltered homeless. Teams working on getting people out of encampments. CA procuring hotels and motels.

- ‚Äúappropriate social distancing‚Äù is the priority

- Currently working on California finances. Have to focus on workers more than ‚Äú2008-2009‚Äù.

- current number of schools currently shut down 80-85% of children (51% of districts). Smaller districts staying open. 

- On Tuesday, detailed guidelines for schools will be released regarding feeding children. Working with private sector to provide nutritious meal alternatives throughout CA. Focusing on children with disabilities and special needs.

- Still making decisions on how to handle the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù rise in cases. 

- ‚Äúsignificant capacity‚Äù in current negotiations for large hospitals to be announced this week. Not every community has adequate # of beds. Minimum 700 new hospital beds to open this week.

- Newsom believes there‚Äôs many workers that can still be productive by using social distancing. That‚Äôs why restaurants and other businesses should stay open.

- question: ‚Äúhow bad with the recession be?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never been in a better position to stop a recession. Didn‚Äôt have the same liquidity, etc.‚Äù CA modeled a mild recession, 3 year impact of $70bil in revenue. Worse than 2001, better than 2008."
