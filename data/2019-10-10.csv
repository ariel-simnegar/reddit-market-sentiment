2019-10-11 07:01:47,GodOfDarknessWine,-6,"You austists keep falling for the same bullshit over and over again.
It's either a nothingburger, or trade talks will collapse.
If it's a nothingburger, Mango will fuck it up this weekend.
There's rising pressure to fight back against China, people are pissed about Hong Kong and American Corporations ass kissing President Winnie.

Mango will fuck it up either way, Bears will have their revenge, and most of you will cry over your puts.
China and the USA are fighting over domination.
The Pentagon would rather stage a mutiny then allow China to dominate the USA. Would be nice seeing more public pressure towards Congress to pass bills, even override Mango to really crack down on China, weaken them economically and militarily."

2019-10-11 06:41:13,Hanz-Wermhat,13,"You autists really think mango and Winnie are gonna stand up at the fucking press conference and say ""ya we fucked it, tariffs to 100%, we will never make a deal because we both want deals that are fucking diametrically opposite to each other's geopolitical goals""

No, Winnie will give Donny a hamburder and donny Will give Winnie a pot of honey and they will agree to ""framework"" for ongoing talks or some other bullshit and reconvene in November with a truce to tariffs in the mean time. 

Donny pumps the fuck out of stocks and xi drags it out giving him more leverage whilst getting closer to elections and putting more pressure on mango via the slowly tanking economy.

Or version 2.0 without a tariff truce sees Mango ratchet up the pressure via increased tariffs in a few weeks tweeted from the toilet on a Sunday night right after you bought calls"
