2019-10-11 05:56:54,Kc_Ryback,6,"First things first, I've been waking up before the bell to check indicators and decide on the positions that will probably end up making everything I work for totally worthless by noon. Given the hype behind trade talks and implied volatility, I'll probably get the lady to dome me up before I start the day. Then, it's straight to the hospital for me bros....to  get the mega dildo that rammed my ass earlier today medically cleared before the one that's probably going to haze me tomorrow shows up.

Bummed to hear that the President will meet for talks in the afternoon. Hopefully the outcome becomes news w/ more than an hour left in trading, leaving enough time for the panic traders to boost me into cover on either side. Earlier in the week, bears blocked bulls at the 297.5 resistance level in epic fashion (for the entire session) propagating a steep bearish reversal at close. That key level will have my attention, representing the strongest bearish resistance before 298.75 (297.5 is the most critical.) If it breaches, a report indicating trade progress - not necessary a deal but + sentiment from both sides - may provide an opportunity for the 300 lotto calls to possibly clear. On the bearish position, 292.4 is my key support even though it wasn't tested to the extent that 297.5 was. If it breaks, further support may present in the 291s before a 290 break becomes even a possibility. I feel that there has to be some relatively negative news for a drop < 288, but market position on the report will be a significant factor here. My wildcard for the session will be the active volume that has failed to materialize most this week, as I feel it will be necessary for a breach of either strong resistance or support levels.

I don't believe the market expects a breakthrough deal tomorrow, but rather, simple progress. Curious to see if the outcome gives the market enough gas to breakout. Lastly, if any of my positions fall writable within reason at any point throughout the session, I will write them and avoid a .01 vs lotto gamble late in the day. If talks happen to extend past the closing bell, that would be mega turbo gay. At that point, I will most likely be found en route back to the hospital for the diagnosis of ass haze #2.

Good luck fellas. Action tomorrow is going to be awesome."

Right now it‚Äôs quantitative easing. I like what he‚Äôs doing because until China is thoroughly crushed a recession right now would probably destroy us. He can sound wishy washy but he will stop a recession at all costs. QE was supposed to end in September then October now it‚Äôs November. He‚Äôs trying to make up for raising rates at the worse possible moment.

If something is going wrong you don‚Äôt tell your boss it‚Äôs bad you say things are going great. Then on Friday at 4pm right when you‚Äôre both walking out the door you say yea about that.. it didn‚Äôt go so well. See ya Monday

Personally I think we won‚Äôt get a deal, cause trump and his goons are looking at other escalators to hurt China. China has no reason to make a deal, especially with how it acts with unfairly disadvantage by us companies as trump wants them to stop doing but China said they won‚Äôt negotiate on that.

Trumps got the Kurd and Turkey fall out. The impeachment fallout. The weakening economy.

China frankly could see roughing it a bit more on the trade war and wait till the orange in chief is impeached, resigns or something else, then get back to the table with someone they can stand and who doesn‚Äôt froth at the mouth when his name isn‚Äôt spoken every five seconds."

Nothing impressive about the crayons that doesn't tell you what you already know. The market is just sitting around waiting for trade deal, but has moved in a largely bullish manner and broke the weekly down trendlines. SPY has two bullish resistances, at 294 and 296. If you look at the charts for this year, 294 is a *very* strong testing zone-- throughout the swings of April and August it was largely the line to watch, and we're back to testing it again. Thus a break up to 296 will remove bearish divergences and reaction highs, potentially leaving the days of the near-term bearish case behind us and shifting to a near-term bullish market."
