Why am I addicted? Well, I can't sleep thinking about Tesla's stock price. Literally woke up just from numbers going off in my head.

The worst part? I have no Tesla position. I can't sleep because I'm stressed I have no position. I only have $200 in options right now and I'm stressed because I feel like I'm missing out. This sucks."
