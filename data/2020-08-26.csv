2020-08-27 06:29:57,Howard_510,8,"I did some quick research comparing the Spanish Flu vs. Covid-19. During the first wave of the Spanish flu in early 1918, flu related deaths numbered 75k in the US, which was only 12k more than the same time period in 1915. It was the second wave in Sept-Dec 1918 that was the deadliest, killing 292k vs the 26k that occurred in the corresponding time period in 1915.

When compared to CoVid, I couldn’t find statistics specifically on flu related deaths, but the excess deaths for this year compared to average years as reported by the CDC numbers between 180k-240k.
Of course, this excess can’t be entirely attributed to Covid as other causes of deaths may be associated to the lockdown we had, but it is safe to say that most of the deaths can be attributed to Covid.

A claim may be made can be made that Covid is worse than the Spanish Flu at this corresponding stage. Of course, our population is much higher today than in 1918 which gives us a lower proportional death count, but our medical capabilities have improved as well. A crucial point of re-evaluation will be during September to December months. If we are to make a synchronic comparison, that is when the deadliest second wave of the Spanish Flu occurred."

In the last 5-6 months literally everyone and their grandma learned the basics of how stonks work

So there is a lot more awareness out there now and because of that a lot of people think: this is a bubble!

But at the same time we shrug it off because we know JPow and Trump got our backs no matter what until election day

NOTHING can tank this market right now because the people who actually have the power to tank it (the MMs and large financial institutions) have nowhere else to park the cash but into stonks

You saw today how they tried to move out of FB on some dumb zuck tweet but others came in and gobbled it all up immediately

People are literally HUNTING FOR DIPS TO BUY NO MATTER WHAT

This is what 0 interest rates and promises of using ""full range of tools"" does to the markets

This is not even irrational exuberance. We are all fully aware we are inflating a bubble into the Mars but we are doing it anyway.

We literally have no choice but to dump money into stonks because of no other options.

Before March, we had free will and the option to choose different financial instruments.

Trump took away our free will and forced all of us to put our money into stonks by taking away from us any other financial instruments that used to have returns on investment.

Trumps knows that stonks MUST BE UP in order for the incumbent president to be reelected. So he's doing EVERYTHING in his power to keep stonks up to ensure his reelection."

2020-08-27 05:22:43,fastnlite,3,"im just gonna write this down and see how it feels, kinda like kanye on the jackson hole album.

I think tech is now overvalued. a month ago I wouldnta said that but today I am.

tech shot up on the supposition that covid-19 is here to stay for another 2-5 years. But that appears to not be the case. evidence coming out, even in heavily liberal-bias sources such as WaPo, that herd immunity may actually be closer to 20-30% rather than the expected 50-60%. even where I live the extremely liberal big-city school district is talking about in-person classes in the fall, which would have been heresy even 1 month ago. middle-aged moms are going outside without full chemical suits.

I find it difficult to believe that big cities such as NYC and Milano would not have already reached 20% infection rates, which would explain the big downturn in cases, and all other terrifying indicators of a ""rampant"" pandemic.

now all this tech will have their newly won customers competing with potentially cheaper competitors who are thirsty to retain market share. this is the competitive marketplace.

yes, interest rates will remain low and liquidity high but I think money will slowly begin to drip out of tech and back into impacted sectors such as banking, energy, airlines, and eventually, entertainment and cruises. fundamentals will begin to matter again, and the upcoming earnings season in october will be a bloodbath for any tech that cannot prove it's growth.

im not ready to buy puts, but I am already cutting back on my tech calls, holding more cash, and beginning to hold some leaps in areas of the market that have not returned.

call me a gay bear if you must, but do spend a moment using that retard brain of yours to consider the possibility of what I am saying."

You already lived a lavish live looting the poor. Now you want your kids to be the same but there's this you know problem of the Poor's not bending over and taking it like their parents generation. 

So you and your buddies at the fed decide let's pull one final con. Pump everything and let it crash. 

Then tell everyone hey man now we can rebuild. But we need the poor to front their labor for a little bit while we rebuild. Don't worry Poor's, we will manage and oversee the rebuild and we promise that we will factor in all the labor you expended last time. We promise. Pinky promise, no take backsises. 

And that's how their kids generation will fleece another generation.

The inflation rumor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of TA, most of the trades will go over a typical retard's head. There's also **Jerome Powell's** nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The retards understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these trades, to realize that they're not just plays- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike **Silver & Gold** truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Jerome Powell's existential catchphrase ""We have tools,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jerome Powell's genius wit unfolds itself on their Bloomberg terminals. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  
  
And yes, by the way, I DO have **Silver and Gold calls**. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

Bears who short the broad market or momentum driven tech, especially with FDs, are 100% rich kids who’s parents gave them everything they’ve ever had so they spend their money hoping to find the one time they can point at the rest of us saying “I told u so” 

Scared of a crash ? Trailing stop loss and don’t get back in till you feel confident an equity will go up. 

Even a kindergartener could tell you this is a bull market- trend is your friend till it’s not. When it’s not, take your small *(as long as you don’t yolo on FDs)* loss and then short the fuck out of tech. I’m not a bull or a bear- I’m just another cocksucka trying to make some money on the internet"

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like **fifteen bars of Silver** in his hands without paying.  
  
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  
  
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually. He then asked the girl to come closer and whispered **4% Inflation** into her ear, then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that was possible. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

1) Stop trying to make sense of it

2) Don't short tickers at ATHs

3) Don't try and time the correction

4) Buy ATM calls on most tech tickers on the days low any expiry

5) Don't think DD matters beyond narrative.  Look for good stories.

6) Cash is the best hedge.

7) Do not risk more than 10% of your account on a FD, it won't work.  Even in this market.

8) Stop thinking you're smarter than the crowd.  There is wisdom in the crowd.

9) If you're going to buy puts, just buy shares and sell secured puts instead.  Join theta gang before rug pull game.

2020-08-27 03:31:40,YoYo_Da,13,"Everyone’s asking what time JPow speaks because they forgot to adjust for Fed rate savings time (FST). 

For those who don’t know, in order to save costs on employment, the Fed launched FST, triggering time inflation every year from (a bit before) Labor Day to Memorial Day.

While there are still the same amount of minutes in a day, each hour is now eighty minutes long, meaning the work day is only six hours (and thus only compensated as such).

Under this system, which critics have called “like that scene from Inception but less fun and not a movie,” JPow is scheduled to speak at noon tomorrow, FST.

At this time, many are expecting Chair Powell to announce the continuation of this policy for another four years, possibly at a heightened rate. To accomplish this, the Federal Reserve is currently negotiating with Father Time to secure more lenient rates on the Fed’s ongoing Chrono-lending program. Analysts do not expect this to be a large hurdle, though, as Father Time has been increasingly willing to bloat the time supply, with a record addition of 1,000,000,000 years added between now and the heat death of the universe just last week alone.

While we know this is all a bit confusing, an analogy to DST may help.

Technology has permeated every single sector in the market. 

Financials? Fintech will make banks go extinct


Energy? Gas is dead, long live the battery age


Healthcare? tech


Industrials? tech


Real Estate? tech



are you getting the picture? the entire market is rotating in to tech. there will be no more dot com bubbles, people will not invest their life savings on shit like PET.COM. Investors - both algos and humans - have become smarter. Why do people keep investing in Apple and Tesla despite ""the fundamentals""? Because these are the only companies that will matter in 15 years and their growth is only exponential from here. This is a runaway train and there is no stopping it, the only people that are going to be left behind are the 🌈🐻 and their only legacy in this world will be their epithets' that will all read ""TSLA still too high imo""

2020-08-26 22:18:15,dwdsquared2,11,"My brothers, quick market lesson.  There are a few more important indicators than VIX and VXX.  If you ever wondered what someone means by ""market internals are looking \_\_\_\_\_"" here are some of the things they look at:

* **VIX**
   * The VIX index gauges 30-day implied volatility in SPX and the options on the VIX allow investors to trade their volatility assumptions, whether it is to speculate or hedge portfolio positions.
* **VXX**
   * Tracks the daily percent return of a portfolio comprised of the two front-month VIX futures contracts.
   * VXX is much more liquid than UVXY
* **UVXY**
   * UVXY is slightly different than VXX because it is 2x leveraged. This means that UVXY will return twice the percentage of VXX on a given day. 
   * UVXY is designed for those who understand volatility products and want to profit from increases in the 30-day expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index. 
* **VXN**
   * CBOE Nasdaq Volatility Index (VXN) is a measure of market expectations of 30-day volatility for the Nasdaq-100 index
* **Market Internals on TradingView**
   *  **NYSE $ADV MINUS $DECL (Advance/Decline Line)**
      * The Advance/Decline Line is a market breadth indicator that shows the degree of participation of individual stocks in a markets rise or fall. It does so by subtracting the number of declining stocks from the number of advancing stocks.
   * **NYSE VOLD (UVOL MINUS DVOL)**
      * The difference between the up volume and down volume on the NYSE. 
   * **NYSE CUMULATIVE TICK**
      * The index measures stocks making an uptick and subtracts stocks making a downtick."

One of main requirements to join the S&P 500 is:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500 

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

S&P can't go down by design! Retail ravaged by Covid? Delist Macy's.

Daily Synopsis

The S&P 500 (+1.0%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.7%) rallied to fresh record highs on Wednesday, propelled higher by some eye-popping gains in the mega-cap stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 was left in the dust with a 0.7% decline.

Highlighting a few of the moves: Salesforce (CRM 272.32, +56.27, +26.0%) surged 26% following its earnings report, Facebook (FB 303.91, +23.09, +8.2%) rose 8% on no news, and Netflix (NFLX 547.53, +56.95, +11.6%) rose 11% on no news. Apple (AAPL 506.09, +6.79, +1.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 2153.17, +129.83, +6.4%) were fueled by a pair of Street-high price-target increases.

Consequently, today's leadership came from the S&P 500 communication services (+3.7%), information technology (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+1.5%) sectors, which are home to many of the mega-caps. In the afternoon, the gains broadened out to the materials (+1.0%), industrials (+0.1%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors.

Notably, the market internals weren't as bullish. Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq by a comfortable margin. The biggest laggards were found within the energy (-2.2%), utilities (-1.2%), and real estate (-0.7%) sectors.

In other developments, durable goods orders increased 11.2% m/m in July (consensus +3.9%), and Moderna (MRNA 70.50, +4.25, +6.4%) said its COVID-19 vaccine generated a promising immune response in ten elderly patients.

For some perspective on today's record-setting performance, the S&P 500 finished the day up 58.7% from its March 23 low, up 7.7% for the year, and 13.0% above its 200-day moving average (3079). The latter raises the risk for a technical correction, although the momentum in the market can go on for longer than expected.

U.S. Treasuries finished the day little changed. The 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 92.91. WTI crude futures increased by 0.1% to $43.39/bbl.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the second estimate for Q2 GDP, and Pending Home Sales for July on Thursday.

2020-08-26 21:06:58,B_Bohn,6,"Okay is this correct or no: TSLA split was done to prevent a huge short squeeze. They are paying everyone a 4/5th divi at this Friday. The current float is \~150M. They are essentially adding 600M shares that are ""unbought"" to the market. The only shares that have been bought from the 600M that they are adding are the from the people who purchased shares this week (aug 24-28). This leads me to believe the S&P500 inclusion will be tomorrow or Friday - giving institutional buyers a chance at the ""unbought"" 600M of new shares.

Please rate my autism on a scale of 1-10

2020-08-26 21:03:32,Jaydon1,-19,"I just left from Visiting a new Asian whorehouse for the first time, and this will be the one that I primarily go to. The reviews online say that they switched the girls out every 10 days, so I will always have some fresh talent to see. When I walked up to the gate, I was greeted by a man in his late 30s. He open the gate and let me into the house, I walked upstairs and I was greeted by a small Asian woman about 4’11  and 90 around pounds. I could tell she was in her 20s, and this was the youngest Asian girl I’ve seen during my time in this hobby. The reviews online said that this whorehouse normally has young Asian girls, so that’s a plus. I asked her if I could use the bathroom before we get started. After peeing, I was washing my hands when she opened the door on me. At the time I didn’t think much of it, but now I’m wondering if she thought I was putting on a wire, about to call my fellow officers or something lol. Anyways I like her energy and how she would put the whole dick inside her. Those other Asian girls would halfway ride my dick or only ride the tip, and that was pretty annoying..... The only thing I didn’t like about her was that her feet smelled kind of musty, like some under arms. I still sucked on them for a little while and played with her toes. But I didn’t put them in my face after that. One thing about the Asian girls, is that they like to use a lot of lube during sex. You can barely feel the vagina with all that lube, so you have to start fucking them on an angle so you can feel the pussy. I had to of had been fucking her for like 20 minutes before Realizing that I wouldn’t be able to finish if I didn’t start hitting on the angle. When I was about to finish, I asked her if I could cum on her back. Every time I’ve had sex, it was with a condom. And I always nutted in the girl because why not🤷🏾‍♂️. But I wanted to cum on her for some reason. Anyways I’ve realized that ejaculating in the condom inside the girl feels better physically, but ejaculating ON the girl feels better mentally/psychologically. After I was finished, I asked her if she could scan my WeChat code. If you don’t know, we Chad is basically a Chinese chat app that you have to be approved by another user to join. I asked her to scan my code, but when she did it it wouldn’t let her. I am assuming she just hasn’t been a member of the App long enough. I asked the guy downstairs when I was leaving if he could scan me in, but he said no. He told me to call a phone number that was “the boss” and ask them if they could accept me. 


The reason why I want to be approved on WeChat, is because the Asian whore houses use stock photos when posting ads of the girls online, but this particular whorehouse uses real pictures of the girls on WeChat. I’m not entirely sure how the app works, but if a Chinese person on here could message me to scan my code I would really appreciate it."

Hey Yall, my account is worth a little less than 1k. I have done a lot of dd and feel that AMZN is going to go up(LIKE A LOT) and want to buy leaps. Obviously, they are 2 expensive. Is there any strategy for me that is cheap enough(Looking for around $300 dollars). I don't care about risk, but want there to be good potential. Not just a debit spread with $500 potential max or something."

The Fed is expected to use the annual Jackson Hole symposium this year to change the way it addresses inflation, after it has taken numerous extraordinary measures to fight the impact of the coronavirus on the economy.

Treasury yields have been rising ahead of a Thursday morning speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who addresses the virtual conference at 9:10 a.m. ET.

Powell is expected to discuss a policy of allowing inflation to range on both sides of a target, letting it rise more than the Fed might normally do to help keep the economy from being trapped in low growth."

Turns out even retards can get Nobel prizes, according to their fancy mathematical model the chance that all their positions could be down, triggering massive margin calls, was close to 0%. Trusting this retarded math they kept taking on more and more leverage.

The first few years they were making bank. First year over 20% return, second year over 40% return, third year over 40% return.

Guess what happened next? Market doesn't care about your Nobel Prize math. First in 1997 Asian financial crisis hits they lose millions. Their models convince them to DOUBLE DOWN, take on even more leverage and risk.

You can already guess what happened next, in 1998 Russia decided to default out of nowhere causing massive shock and huge market volatility spike all over the world, they lost $5 billion in 1990 dollars that year.

Moral of the story = If Noble prize winning mathematicians, creators of the options formula, fail at TA and DD this hard, what's the point?
