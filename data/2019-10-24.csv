"" Our main result, which is independent of the market considered, is that standard trading strategies and their algorithms, based on the past history of the time series, although have occasionally the chance to be successful inside small temporal windows, on a large temporal scale perform on average not better than the purely random strategy, which, on the other hand, is also much less volatile. In this respect, for the individual trader, a purely random strategy represents a costless alternative to expensive professional financial consulting, being at the same time also much less risky, if compared to the other trading strategies."""

NO REALLY PRO Strategy!!!

Ok guys I have a friend who has been trying a new strategy

It works for him kinda 

Lets say stock v$ is trading at 100$ 

He buys 100 shares at 100$ 

BEFORE EARNINGS

And sets a limit sell order AKA STOP LOSS of 99.90 thus his max loss is 10$ 


If the stock tanks and fails earnings it goes down and he sells out limit sell algo order of max loss 10$ 

If it rockets  and never goes down as it beats earnings then he  collects the profit as the stock is above his average price ?


Tell me why this won’t work

The stock market might be still going but the real economy is weakening - freight movement down to 2009 levels, retailers dropping like flys (the sector that employs the most people), unicorn IPOs flopping at the top (don’t even get me started on WeWork, if they declare bankruptcy we could see commercial real estate market tank overnight) manufacturing in a recession, other economies around the world, notably Germany, are in recession and our numbers are starting to follow and now Amazon, biggest retailer on the planet just had to downgrade its guidance going into the holiday season. 



Lets not even mention the Fed unofficially announcing permanent open market operations after saying the repo market liquidity problem was a “temporary” thing.


Edit: The fact that the stock market is so out of touch with the real economy is a red flag to me, CAT is another leading indicator company and missed bigly and the stock barely moved. Now people are actively saying “don’t bet against the Fed just buy” is scary too, literally the kind of thing you see in market tops, don’t ask questions just buy it goes up forever..."

2019-10-24 22:53:31,wordscaneverhurtme,3,Need tax wisdom from some real ones on here. Here's my plan. I'm down 7k. I'm yoloing the rest of my account on ~110 contracts of SPY 300 1/17/2020 credit spreads that give me around a 7k credit. Riding this to either my breakeven or almost doubling my losses. Say the heavens gift me this win and SPY is way down before 12/31/19 and it looks like I'll have close to a max gain. Is the right play to 1) hold until 1/1/20 and then close them all so that I can still write off 3k of losses for '19? 2) Lock in profits by closing out ~4k worth of contracts before the new year so I only have 3k in losses? or 3) Sell the win at any point on or before 12/31/19 because I have no idea what I'm talking about?

INTC up 3 percent on crushing and guiding up is lol

I think market actually wants to go down but a few good ER from the blue chips boys are keeping it from getting absolutely fucked, but it also seems that nobody is buying any ATH anytime soon unless we get some good macro news I’m buying puts tomorrow.

I don’t expect blue chips to move 20% on an ER but not moving up at all is a telling sign that I would assume nobody trusts anything and even though those stocks are solid, the indexes will rape them down regardless of their performance, they may just lose LESS when it all shits itself."

My conspiracy theory is that this whole thing has never been about Caterpillar. It's about its competitor, Cummins, as their stocks are tied together. Cummins is one of the largest employers in Indiana, Mike Pence's home state. Half of its revenue and half of its investments are from/in China, and it is supposed to be hit hardest by the trade war. You can imagine that if China wants to pressure the administration about trade, Cummins will be the kid to be bullied. But so far they have been doing ok. Which means that Caterpillar should be doing ok. In retrospect, Mike Pence's Caterpillar visit three weeks ago made more sense now.
