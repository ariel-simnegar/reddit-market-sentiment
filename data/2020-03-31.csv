2020-04-01 11:22:42,Leucadian,15,"""The market is bracing for the release of the ADP private payrolls report for March, which will shed more light on how far and how fast the labor market is deteriorating.""

The March 2020 ADP National Employment Report will be released at 8:15 a.m. ET on April 1, 2020. - View [here](http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/)

Long Put Holders: 

This is in conjunction with tomorrows Weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims report (w/e March 27th) - view [here](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases) \- and Friday's March jobs report being released by US department of Labor - view [here](https://www.bls.gov/bls/newsrels.htm#OEUS) \- should be highly considered and anticipated before selling on any pumps today. 

Updated article from yesterday on Unemployment Predictions - [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/31/how-bad-will-unemployment-get-heres-what-the-experts-predict/#77cbec3c4f16)

Side Note: Keep a close on this -

"" Various reports suggest the White House is poised to announce the suspension of more U.S. import tariffs in the coming days to ease conditions for importers already struggling with a drop in demand from consumers."" 

High probability that markets react favorably to this, especially when considering the reported forward momentum of China's manufacturing PMI bouncing from record lows, and moving above the 50 mark which separates contraction from expansion. 

That is all. 

TL;DR - SPY 240p 5/15"

1. It was the most obvious dead cat bounce ever and we're finally going lower
2. SPY quadrupple topped at 263-264 without being able to break resistance
3. Volume was dying down so rally was losing momentum
4. End-of-quarter portfolio rebalancing propped up the final days but is now done
5. China lied about having corona contained
6. Constant news of worse and worse outlooks and the fact that this is far from over. Specifically you had the after-hours press conference by the whitehouse where they were estimating at least 100k american deaths.
7. New york state unemployment office got 8 million calls last week (up from an average of 50k). Markets are expecting 4 million claims nationally on thursday.
8. Friday we get survey number of unemployment (rather than benefits number) which may make this whole outlook look even worse

The market makers know how fucking bad Q2 is going to get. The next 2 months will be shelter in place, meaning massive loss of revenue/earnings for Q2. So over the next couple months, the market is going down, guaranteed regardless of how fast or slow it does.

Decent findings. Small group, nothing insanely positive about it however it does lower the days of sickness and limits the likelihood of forwarding from a more mild to a more severe case. Newer studies will need to see if they can limit the cases that progress from mild to severe through this on varying age groups and in comparison to a control group. Placebo should also be studied alongside these other groups. You would want the control group to be with people who have high blood pressure or issues with their heart because they wouldn't be able to take chloroquine anyways due to the strain it puts on the heart. Interesting stuff. Italy has been saying it works but no such studies from them yet made available to the public. 

Then you also have the moral standpoint of using this drug and hoarding these. People actually need this stuff in several debilitating diseases who will most likely see less if any of normal prescription with shortages.

And downvoted, bears seriously make it so easy to hate them. No let‚Äôs have a ton of people die so I can make a few worthless bucks. Sub is literally straight trash now. No real discussion, no real DD, just the same dumb ass jokes. Grow up. Must be some depressed ass people, need economy to collapse to feel good bout themselves."

In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face."

Fauci has been saying 200k deaths in US since last week. It‚Äôs bad...but given that stocks have retraced 60-70 percent from ATH, how much fucking lower do you really expect to go? 

How much more is there to sell off? Does a 80 percent retrace price in a global recession? Does 90?

I feel like a lot of people want to be attached to a unique event, trading on emotion, wanting to be a part of a sort phenomena: circuit breakers, historic lows, Great Depression, dystopian fantasy! But that‚Äôs not really how humanity works. Survival is in our genetic code. SPY isn‚Äôt going to fucking 0.

What has changed? Why will people sell now as opposed to weeks ago? Now we even have an estimate of deaths and timeline that seems realistic, and have implemented measures to help (yes, maybe these measures will prove somewhat ineffective and well have to adjust and this will cause some tumult).

But I‚Äôm genuinely curious why people think stocks will plummet now? I feel like there‚Äôs a stronger case for range-bound trading."

I think there's like 200 treatments in the pipeline just for beer flu.

again, the fed literally gives 2 shits about the stonk market going to ATH.  they need to prevent a liquidity crisis in the banks, which is why they are doing crazy repo and buying up all these assets that have taken a hit in the (what they perceive) short term.  

stonks might rise or be propped by their actions, but even as a last ditch buying equities directly isn't just so they can fuck you out of your option lol.  look at what happened to japan.  the fed has no intention of brrring your precious SPY to 500 if it will fuck over the global economy.

""imagine betting against the fed"" is the dumbest hot take on this sub, perpetuated by people who can't comprehend that they could have guessed wrong and dumb bulls that live with their wife's bf.

2020-03-31 21:37:20,somanychins,1,"Today was the first day in a while that gave the bears a bit of encouragement. We're even a light shade of pink AHs. The low volume on the pump also did not inspire confidence.

I think we're entering the next chapter on COVID. The first chapter was understanding how bad the disease is and what it would take to get under control. We know that now, and we know what it's going to take to get the pandemic down to manageable numbers, and are well down that path in the big economies. VIX has been dropping as a result. Your average 401K has gotten back to DCAing.

The next chapter is what recovery looks like. There are a lot of people out there that are unaware that you don't move from containment back to life as it was before COVID. Most of what I've seen points towards fairly severe measures until you have a vaccine. The disease is still fundamentally dangerous to those in higher risk groups (anyone over 60 plus other risk groups), and those populations may need to continue social distancing. High scale mixing of people likely needs to be limited, such as continued WFH for those that can, and cancelling of large scale events (sports, performances). Healthy individuals will need to begin wearing masks in public as part of daily life. Where restaurants and the like fit in, I'm not sure.

To me there's still substantial uncertainty in how the second chapter plays out, what policy stances we will take, and what the economic consequences are. How will consumer confidence respond with continued isolating measures? How does discretionary spending for those 60+ weigh in to overall economic output? What jobs don't actually come back during chapter 2? The biggest unknown is how long it will take us to implement the measures required to move from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. One Month? Two Months? Unwilling to take these steps due to cultural norms? VIX will be back up as we come to grips with this, and we saw the first signs of that today.

Chapter 3 is the path towards a vaccine. We don't know how much economic damage will be done during chapters 1 and 2, and how easily it can be undone. We could be headed towards a recession or a depression, so it's very hard to know the shape of the recovery."

I've been buying and selling my options and making gains but I'm wondering if the people making big gains are day trading their options or holding them long term I have around 30 contracts to expire in Jan 2021 and they're making me a decent percentage everyday. I just wonder is should I sell my option when it peaks on the same day or week and buy back three option at a dip? Or should I just hold till a month before my expiration in Jan. Thanks!"
