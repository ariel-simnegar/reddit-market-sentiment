2020-04-01 11:22:42,Leucadian,13,"""The market is bracing for the release of the ADP private payrolls report for March, which will shed more light on how far and how fast the labor market is deteriorating.""

The March 2020 ADP National Employment Report will be released at 8:15 a.m. ET on April 1, 2020. - View [here](http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/)

Long Put Holders: 

This is in conjunction with tomorrows Weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims report (w/e March 27th) - view [here](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases) \- and Friday's March jobs report being released by US department of Labor - view [here](https://www.bls.gov/bls/newsrels.htm#OEUS) \- should be highly considered and anticipated before selling on any pumps today. 

Updated article from yesterday on Unemployment Predictions - [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/31/how-bad-will-unemployment-get-heres-what-the-experts-predict/#77cbec3c4f16)

Side Note: Keep a close on this -

"" Various reports suggest the White House is poised to announce the suspension of more U.S. import tariffs in the coming days to ease conditions for importers already struggling with a drop in demand from consumers."" 

High probability that markets react favorably to this, especially when considering the reported forward momentum of China's manufacturing PMI bouncing from record lows, and moving above the 50 mark which separates contraction from expansion. 

That is all. 

TL;DR - SPY 240p 5/15"
