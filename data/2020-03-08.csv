I was 60% PUTS up until Friday and ended the week nearly even after those killer upswings ripped through my paper hands. I sold all and I left one yolo on the table for fun.

If anything, sell longer dated (not < 2-3 weeks) spreads and collect money twice on a potential bounce and on the theta. Most likely oil will stabilize and the Russians will cut a deal with OPEC.

TLDR; if you have puts take some profits at this level of IV... if you don‚Äôt have a position be careful entering long options as IV will literally crush you IF the market stabilizes (somewhat in next few days).

1) We reached 2819 on the downward trend and I feel that the contracts are algo driven 

2) Because its algo driven stupid ass algo they dont understand that the orders below 2819 would not be executed 

3) As such the number of contracts for offer increasing with the time in fact it increased from 300 to almost 4k I checked last time 

4) Actual humans cannot buy as much and provide the liquidity to move from 2819 price that is pinned now and algos wont buy it any higher than 2819 due to spreads thats programmed into them 

5) The only way for us to bounce back now if anyone actually like a human taps to buy 4k contracts at 2819 which wouldnt happen

6) With the amount of contracts on offer at 2819 at open this would put a downward pressure and we are going to open down 6-7% unless FED bails us out in pre market operations.

Once the market opens, NYSE circuit breakers work like this: trading halts for 15 minutes if the S&P 500 falls 7% (to 2,764) at any time before 3:25 p.m. ET. Another 15-minute pause is triggered if losses reaches 13% (2,586). If the decline hits 20% (2,377.9), markets will close for the day. **With the exception of the final rule, circuit breakers are suspended during the final 35 minutes of trading.**"

Columbia University has suspended classes on Monday and Tuesday:

""Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I am writing this evening to notify everyone that, because a member of our community has been quarantined as a result of exposure to the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have decided to suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday. This suspension of activities will allow us to prepare to shift to remote classes for the remainder of the week. I want to emphasize that the individual who has been quarantined has not been diagnosed at this point with the virus."

2020-03-09 01:44:06,Lothire,9,"Trump is bros with Saudia Arabia. There are so many rumors and conspiracy theories surrounding them, including Bezos' phone hack that cost him *half* of his net worth in a divorce (and we all know how much Trump hates Bezos).

...but I digress. 

The deal signed in January between America and China requires that China import an agreed upon dollar amount of oil, not volume. Therefore, China is going to be absolutely flooded with oil - all from America. This is most likely an intentional strategy between America and the Saudis to 

1) shift the narrative from Corona, and 

2) create an artificial ""bull"" trigger, as this OPEC-shale war is nothing more than a man-made issue that could be solved in a second. If that ends or a deal is made, then expect a massive rebound.

Love this shit."

**If the Primary futures contract is limit bid or limit offered at 8:23 a.m.** and remains limit bid or limit offered at 8:25 a.m., then trading will be halted until 8:30 a.m. During the halt, the Exchange will provide an indicative opening with price limits expanded to 7% down."

2020-03-09 01:25:03,mackoviak,10,"(Bloomberg) -- Waves of selling in U.S. stock index futures triggered Chicago Mercantile Exchange limits that prevent declines from surpassing 5% from a closing reference price, as the spreading coronavirus rattled investors and crude oil plunged.

E-mini futures on the S&P 500 Index sank 5% to 2,819 as of 8:05 p.m. in New York, hitting a limit triggered when the measure falls 5% from the price calculated in the last 30 seconds of trading Friday. The curb means the contract can‚Äôt trade at a lower price for the remainder of the overnight session, although transactions at or above the threshold are allowed."

Thoughts on buying bearish position at open? Thinking **SQQQ calls** or maybe **UVXY calls** for that volatility. Feel it's ***too late for that*** though... maybe just a small position to hedge against the possibility of completely missing out on THE BIG DROP. But then ***isn't that just FOMO***? And the IV would be so high... What a shitty buy that would be.

Thinking also this might **not be THE BIG ONE** (looking like a slightly more dramatic version of last week). Could be a better time to open a part of a nice bullish hedge, **TQQQ March monthlies** or **VIX puts for next Wednesday**.

2020-03-08 22:23:31,Tirikemen,8,"For those of you wondering about oil tanking, Saudia Arabia is pissed that Russia didn't agree to further cuts with OPEC and so they are starting a price war. Saudi oil is directly targeting Russia's market share by lowering prices on its oil sold into northwest Europe and the Mediterranean region by $6-8/bbl, and it is also lowering prices for oil sold to Asia and the US.

After the current OPEC+ production cuts fall off at the end of March, SA will ramp up their production to make up for lower prices. They currently produce about 9.7 MMbo/d under the cuts, and have 12.5 MMbo/d of capacity. Iraq, UAE and Kuwait can add another 1 MMbo/d onto the markets.

It's definitely possible that oil could fall into the $20-30/bbl range like it did during the last price war in 2014 (meant to challenge US shale, which didn't work). However, this could also be a short-term play to force Russia back to the table by applying a lot of pain, or at least threatening it."
