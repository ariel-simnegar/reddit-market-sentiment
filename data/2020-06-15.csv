2. It‚Äôs Donald Fucking Trump. He will do anything to get re-elected. He‚Äôs not gonna let the economy be in the shitter come November 3rd.

The European Commission announced on Tuesday it has opened anti-trust regulations into Apple's App Store and Apple Pay service in order to establish whether the tech giant has violated European Union competition rules.

Regarding the App Store rules, Brussels is interested in the mandatory use of Apple's own proprietary in-app purchase system and restrictions on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.

On the issue of Apple Pay, the Commission said it is looking into ""Apple's terms, conditions and other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple's limitation of access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality ('tap and go') on iPhones for payments in stores, and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay."""

2020-06-16 10:12:41,Kenshinsasa,0,Question I‚Äôm new. I have less than 25k on my account and I have 2 day trades available tomorrow. Do the trades I sell tomorrow that I held from tonight count towards it? As 3 trades per day or can I sell those positions and also do the 2 days trades?

Just for clarity tho, I have inversed my own logic and I‚Äôm currently short 250 HTZ on 212."
