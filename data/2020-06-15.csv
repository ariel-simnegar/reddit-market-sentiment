2. It‚Äôs Donald Fucking Trump. He will do anything to get re-elected. He‚Äôs not gonna let the economy be in the shitter come November 3rd.

The European Commission announced on Tuesday it has opened anti-trust regulations into Apple's App Store and Apple Pay service in order to establish whether the tech giant has violated European Union competition rules.

Regarding the App Store rules, Brussels is interested in the mandatory use of Apple's own proprietary in-app purchase system and restrictions on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.

On the issue of Apple Pay, the Commission said it is looking into ""Apple's terms, conditions and other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple's limitation of access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality ('tap and go') on iPhones for payments in stores, and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay."""

Curbside service isn't a new idea for Target,Walmart, or Best Buy. They've been spending money becoming more efficient. 

On a different note, search for articles about large investments into handling DATA. At this point, our shopping histories might be more valuable than what we would ever spend in the store.

what was the delta on the SPY call i bought?  and that's if it goes up by a dollar?  so if i bought an SPY call eod yesterday believing bears to be fully fucked, it's gone up by 3 dollars.  so Delta times 3 is my expected profit, seems easy enough....

wait a minute.....WHAT was the theta on that contract again?  so Delta * 3 MINUS the theta and any IV crush is what i can expect to make on this tomorrow?

how much is that....?

edit: gamma is like .04 on 6/19 SPY calls.  ain't gonna save ya.  again you'll still profit.  just like a 30% gain, not the tendie town you might envisage.  and that's if we stay at this level all the way until you sell.  good luck!"

Waited 12 years for another recession opportunity and this is the bullshit we get... A fucking 19 day bear market. Then, inflated market, inflated assets, trillions printed, stonks only go up...

No fucking way I'm gonna FOMO into this overbought bullshit. If the market refuses to drop to a reasonable level, I'm cash gang until it does.

I may be cash gang the rest of my fucking life. So be it. I refuse to buy this inflated, overbought bubble bullshit. If the market is going to be stuck in a bubble forever, it can do so without my money.

2020-06-16 04:13:40,SensibleReply,23,"Last night when everyone was talking ‚Äúbull r fuk‚Äù and ‚ÄúCB incoming‚Äù I posted the following:

‚ÄúI did one thing wrong during the pandemic shutdown and subsequent recovery. 

I bought puts too late. We‚Äôd already hit the bottom. Every circuit breaker day I thought it couldn‚Äôt keep plunging, but it did. Finally got in and the recovery took off immediately and didn‚Äôt stop. But that didn‚Äôt hurt much because of the thing I did right - bought the fuckin dip. Watched my poots go to zero and didn‚Äôt give a single fuck because that rally was face ripping. 

SHOP shares doubled in 3 weeks. Shares, not calls. Lots of shit like that. Anyway, you can be wrong in one direction here and be fine. But what you can‚Äôt do is be late to be a bear and then late to be a bull. Don‚Äôt chase. Buying puts tomorrow is a sucker bet. IV and theta will eat your ass. Hold a little bit, watch some things develop. FOMO is the enemy.‚Äù

Calls are going to be like that tomorrow. If you held calls overnight tonight, good job! You‚Äôre winning, maybe take some profit. If you didn‚Äôt, no fucking sweat, you‚Äôll get the next one. Buying calls tomorrow is chasing. Resist the FOMO. FOMO is the mind killer."

2020-06-16 03:12:34,ThePeoplesBard,19,"An excerpt from my upcoming novel for gay Bears, *50 Shades of Red*:  

""What's wrong? You haven't touched your coffee.""  

""Oh, nothing."" And that was true. Nothing is wrong in the world. Because in an unexpected moment, rare and mystical as a circuit breaker, I met another man.  

Well, maybe *met* isn't accurate. I didn't even get his name. When he left after our encounter, I realized I could say his name as well as I could the name of Elon Musk's children.  

But somehow I know I'll see him again. I can feel him out there. We now have an invisible connection that is somehow tangible, like the connection between an option's seller and its buyer. My heart's needle turns in his direction like a compass finding the magnetized liquid iron near the north pole.   

Heh. Iron. *Iron condor.*  

He was long-armed like a condor was long-winged. I could still feel those arms around me. Did you know condors mate for life?  

But, no, he was nothing like an iron condor. As a play, he was something much more dangerous. There was no limit to his upside...or downside. He had the physicality, bouncing intensity, and exoticism of a kangaroo. Moments of intense intimacy quickly met with moments of true terror. No phase lasted long enough to fully set in and allow my lizard brain to rest or take flight. I was always on edge, always *alive*.  

And to think it all happened in a flash, in a parking lot, just before returning my Hertz rental car. News reports claim they are going bankrupt, but I am buying calls. Because I know they'll have my business until they are closed for good. I'll rent a car every day, following my compass, until I bump into my nameless man again.

Put a pile of shredded three cheese mexican blend on one half

Put three packets of Taco Bell hot sauce on top of cheese

Fold tortilla in half and brown on each side.

If done right the pan will stay completely clean and you can flip the tortilla either with your hand or use a spatula and throw it back in the drawer (it wont be dirty).

Sick of everybody giving J pow 100% credit. America just has the best brands, products and most importantly technology and security in the world. That is why the US stocks are nowhere near where they deserve to be. Most of the people in the world are outside the US and they all want American products, services, and tech. This is only enhanced by China being shady af and losing everybody‚Äôs trust. You might not trust Apple 100% but you trust them a whole lot more than any Chinese copycat company trying to make the same product for pennies on the dollar cutting corners every step of the way. Chinese companies are super overvalued, but US companies (especially tech companies) are so Undervalued it is stupid! Take Shopify for example. They have proven data with statistical significance showing their Shop Pay payment method has 2X conversion rates of any other payment option. They will literally get 2% of most online transactions maybe FOREVER. How do you even begin to model the future value of that?? Bless up"

2020-06-16 02:04:40,ThePeoplesBard,9,"An excerpt from my upcoming novel for gay Bears, *50 Shades of Red*:  

""What's wrong? You haven't touched your coffee.""  

""Oh, nothing."" And that was true. Nothing is wrong in the world. Because in an unexpected moment, rare and mystical as a circuit breaker, I met another man.  

Well, maybe *met* isn't accurate. I didn't even get his name. When he left after our encounter, I realized I could say his name as well as I could the name of Elon Musk's children.  

But somehow I know I'll see him again. I can feel him out there. We now have an invisible connection that is somehow tangible, like the connection between an option's seller and its buyer. My heart's needle turns in his direction like a compass finding the magnetized liquid iron near the north pole.   

Heh. Iron. *Iron condor.*  

He was long-armed like a condor was long-winged. I could still feel those arms around me. Did you know condors mate for life?  

But, no, he was nothing like an iron condor. As a play, he was something much more dangerous. There was no limit to his upside...or downside. He had the physicality, bouncing intensity, and exoticism of a kangaroo. Moments of intense intimacy quickly met with moments of true terror. No phase lasted long enough to fully set in and allow my lizard brain to rest or take flight. I was always on edge, always *alive*.  

And to think it all happened in a flash, in a parking lot, just before returning my Hertz rental car. News reports claim they are going bankrupt, but I am buying calls. Because I know they'll have my business until they are closed for good. I'll rent a car every day, following my compass, until I bump into my nameless man again.

The hardest part is the emotional pain; I can‚Äôt take losing any more money, not even a $1k, so I  constantly have decision paralysis when trading. Most of the trades I made were initially successful but I eventually screw them up by being too greedy, fearful or getting too complacent. I feel my biggest problem is managing my emotions.  Anyone crawled out of a hole here tell us how they did it?

Whether that ultimately matters with the Robinhood traders bidding up dead companies and throwing money at every meme stock they hear about, or JPOW holding emergency printer ink replenishment meetings, remains to be seen. 

At this stage, I refuse to be a bull because there's a difference between a real market and one that is propped up. This is not a real market, this is running on fumes and sheer determination to win an election. 

Do you fight it? IDK. You shouldn't ever fight the Fed, but the flip side is this: JPOW isn't moving the markets like he once he did. Much like COVID news the market is becoming immune to these meetings.

Tomorrow will be green, **Tuesday is National** ***Buy Fucking Puts Day*** and I will, because it's better than paying premiums on a $320c and hoping to god we trickle up the stairs like an old person on a wheelchair stairlift.

2020-06-16 01:06:43,LiveNDiiirect,15,"Alright. I spent a lot of time this weekend researching recession trend patterns. 1929, 2000, 2009 all showed the same pattern: Crash, rally up to 1/2-2/3ish compared to what the market was at before the crash, and then full blown bear market. I watched videos of Island top patterns, which we just saw last week, that have historically pointed to reversals in market sentiment. Everything that's occurred in these past market meltdowns looks incredibly similar to what we're seeing now.  


Yet, there's one major difference between now and then. The Federal Reserve has never taken so much action in order to prop up the markets as it's doing right now. This is the key variable. This is a bubble, there's no doubt. And eventually there will be a major correction. But people were calling out the dot com bubble in 1997, it didn't burst until 2000. This is going to keep going, and Mango Pump and JPOW will clearly do whatever it takes to prop it up and keep it going. This is a more detrimental time to be a bear than a bull, at least for the next few weeks at minimum and probably at least until the election in Novembrrr.

As someone who got slightly cucked before I exited my puts today, don't fight the fed. Don't fight the trend. Big money's gotta park it somewhere, and nowhere else is giving returns besides the stock market. If you don't trust this retarded fucking market, I don't blame you. But you're better hedging with a full cash account than betting on puts, where you'll probably lose it all. Plus it's honestly wack hoping for a market crash that'll wipe out your parents retirement accounts just so you can make a couple grand."

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the the market today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are my puts bleeding? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want SPY at 200 and a black transgender president to fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought SPY would be under 280 this week??? This is so fucked."

2020-06-15 23:55:50,SolitaryEgg,5,"Tomorrow red? Green? Who knows.

But for anyone wondering what the bear case is, this is it:

On thursday, we dropped from 321 to 300. Big red day. 

That night's futures, SPY ran up to 3087. That 3087 signaled a reverse, and we we had a downward day.

That downtrend continued until we bottomed out Sunday night's futures at 2937. Then we reversed again and ran up all day today.

And guess where we are now? 3084 as I type this. The point where we hit a ceiling and reversed all the way down to 2927 last week.

Does that mean we're going to bounce off 308 again and reverse? Well, no. But it's filled in that gap, and the resistance will be there. So if we were going to reverse back down, it's literally right now that it's going to happen (as futures are currently bouncing off ~308X).

So, that's why some people are bearish. Doesn't mean we are right, but there is actually some logic there beyond the retards spouting ""market rigged!""

EDIT: Also I know we like to joke about crayons and TA being bullshit, but this market has actually been bouncing off support and resistances pretty normally. The algos make TA real.

The only anomaly is how often they have been broken by huge rallies and selloffs. That's why I would never say with huge confidence that it *will* bounce off 308, just that this is the point in which it very well could."

They just did a 20:1 reverse split last week so their stock would be at about $1.20. Look at their balance sheet. Lots of cash and they were making small profits pre-covid so they were managing cash. They fired their founder/CEO and announced a restructuring early in the year. They laid off a ton of people during covid so they should go into restructuring very lean. Timing on that could actually prove to be lucky. It‚Äôs a $1.2 pre split stock that has little chance of going to zero due to cash and low debt ratio. 

They are dumping their physical products business to focus on the service and experience sector. There should be pent up demand for that and also plenty of business that are starving for revenue that will look toward offering discounts through Groupon to pre-sell some revenue.

He was an options trader in the towers and was walking into work when the planes hit. He couldn't go back after that day without trauma, so he decided to move his family here to where his spouse is from and try to become a teacher.

I remember back then being interested in the markets and he tried a few times to explain options, and Greeks and boy was I just not able to grasp the now simple concept. YouTube wasn't around yet in 2004.

Anyway I tried looking him up because I wondered how he might feel about all this going on, and found some cool OP-EDs he wrote in the paper on anniversary's of 9/11, and a city paper piece about his career as a teacher. He was the nicest guy, and I'm sure he's affected a lot of kid's lives well. I figured why even reach out about this shit if he didn't want to deal with it back then. Selfish of me probably. So I'll just remember fondly his poor difficulty with my smooth brain wondering how options worked, and how nice a guy he was. Plus he'd probably tell me I'm retarded for buying OTM shit with 80% of my balance"

For context, I am 130k cash, 25k bear Brazil etf, 45k puts total (mgm, UAL, and ccl for 7/17) and 100k in vanguard ETF.

I went cash on Tuesday, sold even more Wednesday to reach $130k. So I avoided big damage Thursday (edit) (plus had Brazil etf so I was basically flat). Then, Friday, I said if there wasn‚Äôt a big bounce, markets would tank Monday. Markets were going to tank Monday but jpow buying more bonds was definitely known by some.

I made the right play, but the marker is manipulated. It‚Äôs sad at the same time because the American people, like in 08, are going to foot the bill to bail out these corporations. We‚Äôre near all time highs because of the belief in the fed. We have a credit crisis, 20% unemployment, no international travel, supply line issues, and a global pandemic.

I will happily let the bulls march over me. They win. Money doesn‚Äôt lie. But I‚Äôm still proud. Sometimes, the right decision doesn‚Äôt lead to the best outcome.

I've promised myself time and again that I'll dump him like a penny stock over-inflated by its crooked CEO. But here I am again, in his bedroom. Bag holding.

*Well, actually, he's holding my bag.* After my Dockers drop faster than the market after the President Tweets about China, he cups my satchel in his hands. Gravity explains the speed, not hunger. I can feel his heartbeat in his wrist, pulsating slow and steady--like a flat day.

There's no excitement in his movements. And that's the problem with this man. It's always cool indifference. Yes, he's never angry or cruel, but he's also never impassioned. It's safe. Too safe. I can feel my love and my youth losing value, like an OTM option trapped in the purgatory of Theta. If something doesn't change soon, I'm going to expire worthless."

I look out the window. What was once fantasy in video games like Fallout: New Vegas have now become reality. Nuclear war. Trade wars and resource tensions have escalated to the point of no return. The bombs have fallen. I take shelter in my bunker.

I consume spam and eggs for dinner, for the upteenth time for over three decades. Is this finally the bear market rally? Surely, the market cannot survive a nuclear apocalypse. I open my Robinhood to check up on my puts, which I luckily dated for 2050, having bought them in the late 2000s.

..it couldn't be. SPY, at all time highs? But, how? It was foretold, a market crash during an apocalypse! I check the news to see why.

""Markets are forward-looking,"" said Cramer. ""The market is currently pricing in a full recovery by the 31st century.""

Thirty first..what? The 31st century? Surely, he was joking? The markets were pricing in a recovery of the human race over a thousand years from now?

I sell my puts. It is time to throw in the towel. I look down at my spam and eggs, consuming them, tears rolling down my face.

I'd say this looks more like the V from 220. Market was limit down in nighttime futures, then  Powell announced unlimited QE in the morning to the biggest shrek dick in history. We basically never looked back from there. I can't imagine anything that signals a move back to risk on more clearly than the fed buying corporate debt.

I guess we won't know until tomorrow what this really means, but algos could go insane tomorrow. I'm probably overhyped, but depending on what Jerome says we could realistically be 320 by end of tomorrow."

At first glance it doesn't look like much has changed in terms of scale of the program. Perhaps it's more general stimulus rather than a backstop? Can anyone explain? Did I miss something?

In terms of implications for stocks, if the Fed has a meaningful impact on lowering credit spreads, this should impact the Equity Risk Premium in the short term further supporting elevated valuations. Ultimately liquidity will probably flow into the equity market as well.

The long term zombie company argument is certainly a risk, will have to wait and see on that one."

Thirty first..what? The 31st century? Surely, he was joking? The markets were pricing in a recovery of the human race over a thousand years from now?

* VVIX went from 160 to 140, but that is still VERY VERY high. Smart money is hedging with VIX, they smell something big coming
* TLT and XLF are in inverse relationship. When TLT rallies, XLF tanks (see thursday) however, XLF went from -2.5 to +1.5 today and *TLT stayed very very strong* I expect further hurt rest of week
* for me to change my mind that this is not a bull trap, I would want VIX under 30 and TLT dropping like a rock

Net bookings for the remainder of the second quarter and the third quarter have remained positive since the end of May.
As such, for  July 2020  the Company expects consolidated capacity to be down approximately 75%, and domestic capacity to be down approximately 70%, which is almost double the  June 2020  schedule. The Company also expects July passenger revenue to be up between 50% and 100% versus the Company's  June 2020  passenger revenue estimate.

Would it be pants-on-head retarded to just buy a bunch of TIVX shares instead of buying puts?  This is assuming my gay bear dreams come true. My thought process is that TIVX shares will have decent return into heavy volatility where options would get ass blasted every day until they're worthless if I'm wrong or early. Also easier to unload in a pinch.

I own 500 shares of AAL (19.46$ avg cost--I FOMOed, got greedy, and had a lim sell order just above its peak last week). I don't view it as a long term hold.

If I, say, sell 5 call contracts *that get bought* at strike $20 for $1 per contract expiring June 26, the options appear to me to be:

1) they expire ITM, and I profit $500+.05*500=$750.

2) They expire OTM, and I profit $500 and still keep my shares.

The only downside appears to me to be if the stock were to expire at anything above $20.5, I'd miss out on potential further profit. This is an exchange I would happily make.

Are there any other downsides here? This is using shithole meme broker RH, not a real one."

And the list goes on. Yes we have massive volatility so a few -5% days that slowly get bought back will happen but 6 months+ term I can‚Äôt see a bear case. Please enlighten me. 

Edit: One point to add is that bears think market and economy are linked tightly. Massive money printing is really good for asset inflation to keep house prices and equities up but not necessarily good for people, people could be suffering and stocks could be booming due to a massively increased supply of the dollar."

The news changes its narrative every five minutes. One minute it's second wave, the second it's buying bonds, the third it's vaccines, the fourth it's another shutdown.

Don't buy any of it. Make secure strategies and don't trade on emotions. Cash is a very powerful position to have, don't get high on gain euphoria like I did. All it takes is one random, out-of-the-blue day to kill us all.

Be wary, and trade intelligently."

2020-06-15 20:36:34,zsx00,13,"These price actions remind me of late february. Spy hit 332s and dropped to 321s, but quickly recovered past 332 into 338 before the big drop.

This time spy was at the 323s before that big pullback, but it seems to be recovery quickly and will probably pass 323. I think the same thing will happen, it will get past 330s, maybe even close to 340, and volatility will come back, specially if we have a negative catalyst like:

- 2nd COVID wave
- mortgage crisis once all the mortgage freezes are lifted and people still don't have jobs
- unemployment
- supply lines
- less consumer spending

I think once we are back to the 320s level, any bad catalyst will trigger a big sell off. Not to mention, there is no much upside to buying past 320. Seriously, if you buy at 320, where are you selling? 330? What if we don't reach 330?

You need to be in before they announce (if it even gets to that point). Dont expect CBs though. Earliest i can see a CB is when after July unemployment benefits end + the burden becomes too much for the consumer, even then unlikely for a CB as it will probably just be slow but decisive bleed down.  That could be August but most likely will occur after November (elections). I'll be cash gang tomorrow but will go in on puts if SPY break 315 and average down at 320, 325 if necessary.
