Not sure if it’s a rat race to unload at this point or if all parties (they are obviously all doing it) keep the party going. At this point if they all unload the losses they are going to take will be huge. Might see a pop Tuesday and we trade sideways for a while. Big boys need to unload profits.

2020-09-07 08:03:24,scopolamine,6,"Reminder, in case of a short crash or correction (15% to 20%), Fed already has a plan with BlackRock.

In August 2019, BlackRock published a playbook for Fed to deal with the next downturn. [Source](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019.pdf).

Fed is acting each step according to this playbook. Everybody is asking what is next for Fed.

One feature of the BlackRock plan is the proposal **for central banks to buy stocks (equities).**

>Any additional measures to stimulate economic growth will have to go beyond the interest rate channel and ‘go direct’ – \[with\] a central bank crediting private or public sector accounts directly with money. One way or another, this will mean subsidizing spending – and such a measure would be fiscal rather than monetary by design. This can be done directly through fiscal policy or by expanding the monetary policy toolkit with an instrument that will be fiscal in nature, such as credit easing **by way of buying equities**. This implies that an effective stimulus would require coordination between monetary and fiscal policy –**be it implicitly or explicitly.**

I am expecting Fed to buy stocks in the next crash."

For some reason some part of my brain thought how weird it would be if some guy in a suit was outside my window. I had the urge to get out the bed and look out the window just to reassure myself and my fucking heart dropped. There was a random ass guy in a fucking suit and hat outside my fucking house checking his phone. I closed the curtains and was literally sweating. I peek out the window a second later and the guy fucking vanished. I try to look outside from a different angle to get a view of the street and gone, vanished.

Like I became a chad and dont even know it.

During these 4 Month of COVID I started cooking my food and not eat outside lunch like I used to 

Also doing 200 push ups 4 day’s a week 

This made me lose all my gut 

My stomach went down drastically now 

When I go to the park I have random woman talking to me and I’m like wtf?   Is eveyone lonly now 

But I saw a friend today male and all he can talk about is tips I can give him to get a small waist like me.


I’m just like dude all I did was cook my own food 

And stop eating out for lunch and dinner"

We are stuck in a Broadening Formation and likely 3600 is god tier resistance that would be difficult to crack and establish support above even if tomorrow a vaccine is magically discovered, tested, and ready to get distributed to every American.

SPY 200 is actually a real technical possibility within the next two years. But so is breaking above 3600 to new heights. That however might take more time.

Tuesday (in my humble opinion) will be bigly green. I doubt it holds though. Not sure on that timing yet, might dump eod, or we string a few green sessions for this week. 

No matter what though (and once again in my humble opinion) we are going down over the next few months. I 100% think we will be selling on good news and will test the put installed by the FED. This is both because of the unknown (presidential election) and the known (the economy is no where near the levels we saw in 2019) and won’t be getting back there anytime soon.

Once that Powell put is tested and the market literally moves the Fed to act, it won’t matter as we will then be pricing in the true damage to the economy and the time it will take to return to normal."

It’d be about blue collar worker who buys stock in AAPL when he’s super young after seeing an ad in his newspaper, and then the stock goes up over 20 years and he’s made more money and moved to a big house.

It would literally just be just him aging and watching TV ads about Apple and then watching more stuff like YouTube streams about the iPod, iPad, and smart watch.  

Camera fades out with him using an old school record player, a Samsung phone, and no Apple product in sight

2020-09-06 22:22:02,abogado-de-aves,8,"First of all Tuesday’s probably green but more importantly if you are panicking u shoulda fucking hedged what are u doin. Here’s how

Hedge ~10% fd puts in the same sector you have calls in for example, I have about 6k in tech calls across various tickers mostly 2 weeks out. So I bought 700 in QQQ puts expiring this Friday. When the puts print they print so much that it makes up for most if not all of your call losses

So if Tuesday opens green, the puts will be down ~40% at open, no big deal I sell them and let the calls ride. If Tuesday opens red, you day trade more puts to make money on both sides. At the end of a green day you buy 10% puts again to hold overnight, rinse repeat"

First of all

9/25- 440c

So as I sit here and begin to think deeply of my love the incomparable Mr Musk,  I can’t help but think that I am fucked. 
So we basically ran up from 1340 to over 2500 based on a stock split,  “POSSIBLE” S&P inclusion and the “HOPES” of great battery news.    So massive FOMO took over and took up to great heights. Everyone from big money to retail to degens like us even the ticktok and instagram thots started piling in. My 65 yr old dad was buyiny deep otm yolos and life was good.  But I ask you now.......

Who is left to buy? Honestly?  Who out there that’s not all ready in, is left to buy?  On top of that we have basically already priced in S&P and a million mile battery.   Anything less then everything going perfect and I feel like $300 is far more likely then $500.  And with the s&p seeming like an extremely doubtful thing it seems troubling My account prays I’m wrong.  But well we know every ride ends sometime"

We have reservations at a Michelin star restaurant in the city that has a 4 month waiting list. I used to sleep with the hostest so there's no need to book.

After dinner we might head over to one of the nightclubs nearby for some more drinks and coke. Brad is a shit trader but he does have a trust fund, otherwise I wouldn't be able to stand him.

There is an idea of a long weekend. But it simply is not there."
