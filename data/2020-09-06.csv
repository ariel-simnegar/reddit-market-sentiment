The pursuit of a big titty autist waifu should motivate any man to do his DD and make big moves in the market this week."

I used to wipe my ass with the tissue and leave it on the side of the stall.

Then I would wait and watch as the next guy came in and made a scene about it.

The whole office was mad and it was a mystery of who left shitty tissues in the bathroom.



That’s is my asshole confession 

What is yours ?"

2020-09-07 09:37:47,dajochi,3,Read the zero hedge article on SoftBank. Actually a bit scared now if the MMs decide to unload their shares. Not sure if it’s a rat race to unload at this point or if all parties (they are obviously all doing it) keep the party going. At this point if they all unload the losses they are going to take will be huge. Might see a pop Tuesday and we trade sideways for a while. Big boys need to unload profits.
