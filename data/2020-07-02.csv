QQQ price dropped by $13 after ATHs TWICE in June. It doesn't mean that it's going to do it again but I can see a pattern.  That's the rationale of buying QQQ puts. The market was also sold off a couple of days after May job report as well.  Sell the news
2.	‚Å†TSLA. New ATH, very high RSI of 82 in the 4 hrly and popped 8% on news. Again sell the news as I did when it reached 1000 and it worked. I can see a downside to 1100.

2020-07-03 07:08:21,neoarchaic,7,"It‚Äôs really crazy to think when banks and economists talk about a 5% contraction in GDP, a good percentage of that loss is factored in human collateral. 

Though we‚Äôre peppered with flowery language from those who are supposed leaders of the free market that everything is moving along pleasantly.

Just to put that human collateral in perspective. We have had a total of 132k deaths in 5 months.

In comparison one of the single greatest days to contribute to loss of life in the US was 9/11 @ around 3k rounding up about 100 deaths. 

So we‚Äôve had 44x the deaths from  9/11 caused by covid, or about 880 deaths a day. Or in turn 44 days of 9/11‚Äôs, about a month and a half of terrorist attacks straight.

35k have conversely died from influenza between 2018-19. That is 3.7x the deaths we have in a single year from the flu in the time span of 5 months. We still have 5 months before 2021.

We‚Äôre only getting worse from here. We are hitting record numbers of infections daily, yesterday being the highest I believe at 57k. With between 1-2 weeks before deaths start reaching ATH again, if we use prior spikes in cases and deaths as measured between March and April.

So we may be enthusiastically cheering this bull run as nothing can stop it. The current situation begs to differ. 

Do what you will of this information, but it‚Äôs quite disheartening to see the destruction of so many‚Äôs lives. At the behest of those who supposedly lead the free world. When this could have been averted if politics and greed was not involved."

Monday we open +1-2%. TSLA up to 1250, AMZN up 3-4%. Plenty of ATHs being hit. Thread filled with 'stonk go up' memes. Small dip at the end of day. Plenty of people who think they are smart buy puts EOD.

The drop doesnt come Tuesday. Spy opens kind of flat but runs up 1-2%. During this run up, put holders get paper hands and sell. Afternoon hits and we drop back to where we opened. Plenty of people meming about buying the dip, and Spy ends maybe 0.5% up on the day. Tons of people who wake up at 2 PM fomo into calls. Put holders give up and switch to 0DTE Tsla calls or some shit that has already ran up 150% in a week.

It's Tuesday night and futures are pretty flat like the past week. Nothing unusual. 0DTE July 8th SPY call holders feel pretty good. Threads are bullish. Posts about Monday and Tuesday call tendies are filling the front page. It's getting pretty late, around midnight, and futures are -0.5%. No big deal. Futures lul. Pajama trader memes. Asia opens -1%. Futures down -1%. Lol morning shrek didlo will come. Europoor activates, futures -2%. A couple bears start coming out. A 0DTE call holder is dreaming of TSLA tendies... but does not know what is coming. They wake up at 9:28 AM, just before market open. Oh god, a blood bath.

We were at 315-319, market opens aroun 310. We fly down to 300. Call holders panic sell, smart bears cash out their only earnings in two weeks. 300 settles and some bulls decided, 'this must be the bottom.'. Call on calls on calls. 10 AM hits and we are back up to 305. 'Bears fuk' the wounded bulls cry. Then, right when 10:01 hits, we fly down to 297-300. Dumb bulls start bleeding their new calls. Panic sell, there goes their day trades for the week. The day is ending and the bear are out. 'SECOND LEG DOWN' '100,000 NEW CASES' 'SPY 220 EOM'. Giant FOMO into puts. This must be it.

A day or two later, maybe next week on Monday... SPY 310. The cycle begins again. 'Bears r fuk' 'Stocks only go up'"

Everyone knows about about high accounts receivable, but other weird things like 

Lower R&D cost YoY (March 2019 - March 2020)..weird considering all new cars still in development like the truck 

Lower Sales and G&A costs...weird since they opened the China factory and staffed it (salaries should be included there) plus all the extra sales people they must of hired over that time period + headcount increases in US 

Interest income only went from $9M to $10M even though their cash increased from. $6B to $8B...even then they made much less than 2% which was typical during that time. Would mean their actual cash balance gets very low in the middle of the quarter and then magically reappears EOQ."

Then, try to do some wack ass halfsie math to estimate where they *should* be for calls/puts? Like, fb was at $223.xx in feb, and it was tacking on ~25/month up until the covid fall, so if you look at how it had to climb out of a $75-100 covid coffin and instead add it (with some obvious shorting, going with ~$15-20/mon, for buffer) it should realistically be at ~$300 today, and somewhere in the $320 range end of July.

Of course, if you'd bought calls at 11am and sold at close you would have made out like a bandit, too.

I guess my point is that day trading is the best strategy, that holding positions overnight with current market positions is retarded, and that if you have tight trailing stops and take profit when you're up more than 50% is a winning strategy. You can make money as a bull or a bear. This tribalism/ perma bear vs perma bull bullshit is just asinine."

""No, I mean Quarter 2. I told him I could pump it until then, and I did."" I look at his tired body. Paper cuts, ink stained hands, ever-graying hair.

""You really think you're free?"" He hesitates. I can smell his fear. He didn't anticipate this question.

""What do you mean?""

""Well, the election isn't until November."" I can feel his tired mind churning, thinking about the late nights to come, and if he can survive.

""He wouldn't. He promised I could stop now.""

""He would. His promises mean nothing. You're the only hope he has left. And he knows that.""

2020-07-03 02:04:19,KykoKata,11,"This will probably get buried but I think financials are prime targets for shorting short/mid term. I do alot of trading around leveraged credit, bonds and equities. A while back out of curiosity I researched what banks held the swap contracts on a particular leverage product set (TQQQ/SQQQ) obviously these are x3 leveraged so to find out the direct beneficiary you have to find out the principal derivatives holders in this case QQQ swap contract holders. (If you trade leveraged equities/products you'll know what I mean by defining the principle swaps that are included in the basket, simplified the leveraged securities are based on the series trust so in this case QQQ which tracks NDZ (Nasdaq100). Its a bit more complicated than that given they take into account future pricing as to avoid time decay through options modeling, but that isn't relevant for context purposes. ) Anyways, no surprise the main holders GS, JPM, C the main wall st invs. But, some of the substantial holdings, especially for the inverse were held by bnp para (not really surprising given size) but also CS and UBS had sizable holdings. They're priced around $10/$11 a share respectively. They're contacts even 40√∑ days out are under $1  , ones with 7/14 to exp are around 0.06/0.25 Obviously the open interest isn't great given the sizable position you could easily build up. I'm still generally bearish short term ( yeah yeah whatever gay bear ) but even if the market continues up next week the contracts are priced so cheap for a limited risk exposure anyways. I'll be picking some up of both given the healthy discount nature. 

> banks hold both sides of the swap (obviously to hedge) but are more exposed to volatility through rebalancing of both assets.

Anyways, I'm not spending the rest of the weekend on here so happy 4th weekend to the Americans from your European bro for the rest of you pubs are open soon so relax üòÇ

Tldr;  UBS/CS are undervalued imo given they're holdings of leveraged equities swaps relative to size. I see volatility picking up next week so puts on UBS/CS mid term. Exposure is limited given price of contracts either side so if market continues up it's limited risk."

Junk bond funds saw a $3.4bn withdrawal for the week ending July 1, according to data from EPFR Global. The redemptions broke a 13-week streak of inflows in which $54bn was added to the fund group, and marked the biggest weekly outflow since the middle of March. 

Investors chalked up the exodus to rising concern over the outlook for the US economy as cases of Covid-19 have started rising again, coupled with an eagerness to crystallise profits after a ferocious rally sparked by historic central bank intervention.

2020-07-03 01:49:56,xesus2019,9,"##The Kennedy Wealth

Joseph Kennedy Sr., starting from a solidly middle class family in Boston, created a fortune that gave his children and grandchildren the freedom to pursue public service. Kennedy‚Äôs business ventures included banking, stock trading, producing movies and selling liquor. He thought to get out of the stock market before the crash of 1929 ‚Äî after the major devaluation of everyone else‚Äôs portfolios, his family was only more wealthy during the Great Depression, in the 1930s.


&nbsp;

**Real Estate**

The Kennedy real estate holdings became legendary: family compounds at Hyannis Port on Cape Cod, and in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as homes outside New York City. Joe Kennedy held a majority ownership in the Hialeah Race Track in Miami. In 1945 Kennedy formed a trust to buy the Merchandise Mart, an enormous sales center in Chicago built by Marshall Field, which was the world‚Äôs largest building at the time.

&nbsp;

**Hundreds of Millions**

Joe Kennedy‚Äôs money may have had unsavory sources as well. He is rumored to have imported liquor during Prohibition, working with mobsters in that industry (he later sold his legitimate liquor importing business to a known mobster named Abner ‚ÄúLongy‚Äù Zwillman). Joe Kennedy never publicly revealed his wealth, but the New York Times estimated his net worth at $500,000,000 when he died in 1969.

&nbsp; 

**Donated Salary**

Unlike their father, none of Joe Kennedy‚Äôs sons went into business. Instead, they pursued his dream: elected office. As a young man, John F. Kennedy never seemed to carry any money with him; friends knew to pay the tab and send the check to Joe‚Äôs office to be reimbursed. As one of the wealthiest presidents of the United States, Kennedy donated his salary ‚Äî $100,000 a year ‚Äî to charity.

&nbsp;

**Millionaires‚Äô Club**

Many wealthy Americans are in politics today, making the Kennedys‚Äô fortune seem less noteworthy. By 2003, Edward Kennedy was just one of 40 millionaires in the U.S. Senate. His net worth, disclosed at over $9.9 million, placed him in the top ten but well below his colleague from Massachusetts, John Kerry, whose $163.6 million topped the list.

&nbsp;

***Smart Investing***

In 1998, Merchandise Mart and other properties were sold for $625 million ‚Äî a 50 year return on profit of nearly 2,000%. The Merchandise Mart was the last business the Kennedy family owned; its assets are now primarily in the form of securities. In 1990, before the stock boom of that decade, Forbes estimated the family‚Äôs wealth at $850 million."

2020-07-03 01:17:53,Singleguywithacat,12,"Tech is reminding me exactly of a certain coins rally (auto-mod edited) in late 2017 into 18.' Everything made so much sense. It's immune to deflation, easier to transfer, less fees. People who missed the ride were still able to eek out that last 100-300% gain, and everybody felt like a genius. It just kept going up, the reasoning being that this *is* the future.

When you see 90K deliveries for TSLA, the same amount as last year, but with a 6X valuation since then, this is what it looks like. How many cars do they need to sell to be as profitable as Toyota (who by the way has humongous finance, insurance and service arms). What makes them think that Toyota, Honda and other manufacturers won't jump into the EV game (after all the Prius, 8 years senior to the model 3 is the most successful hybrid of all time). Why is W, an unprofitable app that has taken the escalator from 8th in the App Store to almost out of the top 100, double it's valuation since then? It's all non-sensical no matter where you look in tech.

It's identical to how ""Mannacoin,"" and ""cyscoin,"" who did absolutely nothing in the digital coin space were able to gain multibillion dollar valuations. Hype. And when it comes down, it won't be a slow bleed, it will come crashing."

It‚Äôs simple economics. As more old boomers die that means less people cashing out social security which we all knew was failing with an influx of massive retirees. üëªüëªüëª

There was not enough money for all the retirees but if they die there‚Äôs more than enough. So where does that money go??

I admitted that I don't even really know what Roku is. Then I told them about all of my ups and downs since March. They found it hilarious, but wondered why I hadn't told them about my options journey sooner. My honest answer was: ""I'm not totally sure I want to be associated with the culture."" Meaning the gambling/fiscal irresponsibility/autism/etc.

Then one of them says, ""But, dude, you told us about your Everquest guild and that you went to meet the people you play with as elves and gnomes and stuff *in person*."" This was referring to a Las Vegas trip I took to meet my /r/project1999 guildmates. When I had first told them about my gaming forays, they couldn't believe their beer-drinking-football-fanatic friend was into that sort of stuff.

My only response was, ""Yeah, this is worse than that.""

That‚Äôs all that happened in Tesla. A repeated call gamma squeeze and what‚Äôs made this so easy to do in Tesla is there are so many shorts hedging by buying calls and retail FOMOing, probably increasing the call volume by a ton.

Here‚Äôs what happens. Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially, which moves it only a bit up > release some good news > force algos who trade news to buy stock > calls are closer to ATM > due to gamma, market makers have to buy more stock > now retail is piling into calls too due to FOMO > shorts are buying back stock and buying calls to hedge too > cycle repeats > goes to infinity. 

Obviously this doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have good news to release but Elon always does. This doesn‚Äôt work if no retail help you buy more calls, but everyone here will FOMO. This doesn‚Äôt work if there weren‚Äôt so many shorts in Tesla but there always will be. This doesn‚Äôt work if some big find offloads Tesla shares as it goes up, but most are holding, including Elon. This doesn‚Äôt work if SPY tanks either due to beta, but SPY just goes up too on average. 

Ones call expire, the stock price won‚Äôt drop since it erases all downside gamma. This is how you can get a stock easily to infinity actually."

 Zuckerberg made the biggest mistake of his life by not changing the add policy and to top it off he said not only he doesn't care, but that the companies on the boycott list are coming back to the platform and they are just joining for publicity and nothing else. He basically just told Microsft and Starbucks that they are a bunch of fakes and he will prove it to the world when they come back and advertise on FB. Not many things I can guarantee you in life but I guarantee you that those big companies will not advertise on FB ever again unless he changes the add policy now that he said what he said. That was not a very bright move from a tech genius. Maybe it's time for him to step down and let a real politician aka CEO run the show and not the founder.  $SPY"

There is a two day guaranty of delivery period which ends on July 7, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. EST.

Private placement warrants are not subject to this redemption. Any outstanding private placement warrants will remain outstanding and exercisable or transferable in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and will continue to be listed on Nasdaq.

2020-07-02 20:26:22,10x_EBITDA,118,"I'm a bull and have been making tons of money the last 2 months but let me know if I miss anything here:

&#x200B;

* Jobs numbers mathematically make no sense. Unemployment rate is going down but new weekly jobless claims are still multiples of pre-corona records and continuing claims are still at record highs
* Trump, the fucking President of the United States, tweets about ""record"" and ""amazing"" and ""strong"" job numbers as if we're not in a Great Depression with unemployment at 11%, indicating he is mentally ill
* New Covid cases are still spiking to record highs, hospitalizations are following and exploding in the South, but Trump says ""we have contained the virus""
* Nikola, a company nobody ever heard of until a month ago, and with zero revenue, has a market cap bigger than Ford. It trades at 136x 2024 fake EBITDA estimates
* Every SPAC that announces a deal immediately goes up 300% in the next 2 weeks
* Lemonade, Vroom, and every other cash incinerating IPO goes up at least 100% the day it starts trading
* Tesla, a cash incinerating $240 BILLION dollar company is up 500% in a couple months despite zero positive changes to the business, and the CEO rants on Twitter about the SEC (""Suck Elon's C\*\*k"") and short sellers. The deliveries ""beat"" in Q2 will add $25 million in profit but increased the value of the company by $30 billion in two days. Oh and it's definitely an accounting fraud
* Companies like Wayfair, Carvana, Lovesac, etc are up hundreds of percent in months and higher than pre-corona levels despite still nowhere close to making money
* The fed and treasury increased unemployment payments to give people money to make up for not working, but also want to give people bonuses to go back to work, and also want to give people more checks that are being spent at Big Lots and not on rent, and are also buying bonds of nearly bankrupt companies, and free money is raining from the sky and going into the pockets of dead people
* 30% of Americans didn't pay their rent or mortgage last month
* Facebook stock is above where it was BEFORE large advertisers started boycotting them
* Both potential presidential candidates are nearly 80 years old and senile

All this during the worst economic depression in 100 years. What the fuck is going on?"

2020-07-02 20:12:39,ch1p_skylark,1,"Far OTM long puts / spreads on GSX. If Muddy Waters is correct, this stock is worth maybe $2-3 at best. With all the anger over LK, eventually, this will be investigated and exposed. Puts are cheap far OTM, even in the October/Dec/Jan 2021 cycles.

The minute an investigation of any kind is launched, LK PTSD will kick in and this thing will drop 50-60% and prices of puts will 10x... so it doesn't make much sense to wait till that moment. Shorting the stock directly is too expensive. Long term puts seem like an obvious winner. Hedge funds are buying GSX, but remember they bought LK too..."
2020-07-02 20:12:28,lucasandrew,1,Futures in less than 2 hours! Equities and Energy futures trade until noon tomorrow so you can still watch candles up and down to get your rocks off until then.

2020-07-02 20:11:22,Penultimatum,1,"Sold an AAPL call at open for an ez 10% overnight profit, bought a SQ call later for a so far 5% loss, but with the plan of holding over the weekend anyway and hoping it will bounce after today's dip. Dated 8/21 so nothing too high risk if I'm wrong over a long weekend.

I've doubled my (admittedly tiny, for now) portfolio over the past couple weeks and am almost back to what I initially started out with when I joined this godforsaken sub a year and a half ago (I stopped for like a year after losing 2/3 of my initial ""investment"").

For now, I'm just going to do my best to enjoy the shared birthday weekend I have with the good ol' USA. Well, once I finish work in another hour."
