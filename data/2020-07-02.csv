2020-07-03 15:42:00,drhalxx,8,"1.	‚Å†Given the current market situation and RSI trend for QQQ. Every time there is a new NASDAQ ATH there is a (usually mild) sell off. QQQ price dropped by $13 after ATHs TWICE in June. It doesn't mean that it's going to do it again but I can see a pattern.  That's the rationale of buying QQQ puts. The market was also sold off a couple of days after May job report as well.  Sell the news
2.	‚Å†TSLA. New ATH, very high RSI of 82 in the 4 hrly and popped 8% on news. Again sell the news as I did when it reached 1000 and it worked. I can see a downside to 1100.

These are both short term trades. My exit for QQQ is 243 and TSLA anything around 1100."
