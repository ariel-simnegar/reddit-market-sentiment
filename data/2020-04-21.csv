4/21/2020:

I purposely tied up my buying power in DFEN stocks so I don‚Äôt blow it on trigger finger plays. 

If the market doesn‚Äôt go my way tomorrow I‚Äôll be forced to sell at a small loss. No biggie. I‚Äôll get that back. 

Opening America isn‚Äôt going to fix the economy, oil is shit, testing is an absolute joke.


My mother has a cough and tomorrow she has to travel an hour away to get a BATtests done and she won‚Äôt get results for 4-5 days. 

I‚Äôm not frustrated with the market. 
I‚Äôm frustrated with the response to all this. 

We‚Äôve all travelled. We‚Äôve all had completely different experiences with the TSA. 
Imagine that level of inconsistency being applied to a pandemic. 


Then you get people protesting for the right to get sick and overrun hospitals with their stupidity. 

The $1200 that people got is about to run out and the food banks are having shortages. 
We are sitting on a powder keg playing with matches.

The announced changing their mix as you referenced, which still required selling may and buying June-august.  But you still keep the same total NAV unless those contracts change in value.

Maybe I have this all wrong, but rebalancing doesnt change the value, it just changes the sensitivity to the spot price."

Well I misinterpreted how Netflix counts paid memberships, per their 10-K definition. I thought the free month would disqualify anyone being counted after March 2nd for the quarter. However they must be talking about some other promotional free trial, and people who just signed up and are still on their free month get counted because they've provided a method of payment. I'm a special retard.

I was also expecting a much bigger foreign exchange hit than $115 million, considering they took a loss of $762 million for all of 2019. Overall, only their negative Q2 guidance seems to have saved my bear credit spread bet and I'm glad I did that instead of a bear debit spread. That 10% jump afterhours before dropping lower was unpleasant, and I'm not sure they go lower from here."

If rocket man dies there‚Äôs a possibility of his sister taking over or an internal power struggle that results in various warlord generals fighting over who gets to hold their hand over the nuclear button. This would result in global uncertainty of who ends up in power and worst case If it completely goes to shit there‚Äôs going to be millions of refugees flooding into China and South Korea. After this there will be an immediate attempt by China, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the US to capture as much land as possible. China would conscript the North Korean men into a land war to flood South Korean forces just like they did with their own soldiers in the first Korean War. After millions of North Korean men die the remaining North Korean women become (for a lack of a better term) ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù to china‚Äôs gender imbalance.

**-- DAL To Report Big Loss**

Earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) will take center stage Wednesday.

The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel demand got hammered over recent months and major U.S. airlines have had to slash capacity in an attempt to preserve cash. Investors will be focusing on commentary from Delta‚Äôs management Wednesday morning for any updates on how the company is dealing with the ongoing pandemic.

Delta is expected to report and adjusted LOSS per share of 87 cents on $9.19 billion in revenue during Q1. On April 4, Delta said that it was burning through $60 million of cash per day and expected second-quarter revenue to fall 90%. Much like the rest of the companies reporting this earnings season, Delta‚Äôs big picture and guidance will matter more much than the company‚Äôs financial results during the previous quarter."

2020-04-21 22:25:12,Mr_Objectifier,8,"I have a thought while sipping pre-workout today:

The more you look at the daily news, the more you lose track of the bigger picture. This is because rare events that are news worthy are exactly that‚Äîrare. As such, daily news is filled with utter bullshit that don‚Äôt matter with the bigger picture. 

People who read or watch daily news to become ‚Äúupdated‚Äù on world events, ironically, are the dumbest and the most uninformed because their minds are filled with useless news.

If you want proof for yourself, look at the people who look at future charts at the 1-minute intervals. Look at them: fUtUrEs mOoNiNg or fUtUrEs dRiLlInG. These people have lost the bigger picture, and they believe they are operating at a frontier because they have the most recent news. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm trying to say here, but that‚Äôs my pre-workout unwisdom.

Either way, as a Perma-Bull, I‚Äôm still buying calls, and I will buy calls tomorrow and overmorrow. Ad infinitum."

With people in quarantine they're gonna keep playing their game and they're gonna get their friends to buy to play with them. I bought at $1.75 a contract and it's at $1.47 now. Get a better price than me. I'm holding until the earnings report where I suspect the stock will hit another ATH. Especially given the phenomenal performance of COD and COD:Warzone."

I bough 1 AMZN 2380 5/1 Call today right before the big drop (yeah...). After a few minutes my instinct would be selling to stop loss, but since my balance is under 25K I cannot do any more round trips. So in a hurry my only idea was buying one 2295 5/1 Put to even out things until tomorrow when I can sell again. Timing for the Put was also terrible as you can imagine, but at least one position nulls the other and I can limit my loss.

So now I have:

1 x AMZN 2380 5/1 Call

1 x AMZN 2295 5/1 Put 

Total market value USD 18,830 at close today (plus $70 in cash)

I can simply sell both tomorrow at the same time and start over, but I'm sure someone smarter than me can find a way to reduce my loss and put me closer to the $25K again.

2020-04-21 21:31:10,RybosWorld,11,"It‚Äôs a very well studied phenomenon that leading up to earnings, investors tend to pile up on one side of the options trade. Once earnings releases the stock will move in the opposite direction. So if majority is on calls, it will go down and vice versa.
This happens for 2 reason:

1) MM‚Äôs hedge against the majority side. Once the earnings are released they begin to unwind their hedges because IV crush means they don‚Äôt need as big of a hedge. 
2) option holders get IV crushed and begin closing their positions.

These two feed into each other. This is why you retards keep getting burned on earnings plays.

Of course like everything in the markets, nothing happens every time. A major earnings miss or beat can change things but this happens hardly ever."

2020-04-21 20:18:14,ExtinctLikeNdiaye,2,"I think that USO's structural changes are pretty interesting. 

It seems like a group of people were basically trying to use the USO rollover schedule to force its hand. By basically making their holding strategy less transparent, USO is now able to prevent someone from forcing it into liquidation. 

These folks may be able to force one contract down sharply enough to cause a problem but they can't really force six or seven months down at the same time for nearly as long. 

That said, these ETFs are very high risk especially because of how their risk management structure doesn't account for these massive dislocations. 

I'm in deep and think its poised for a rebound."
