Because NFLX, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT are all up today.  NFLX is way higher than Monday morning.  MSFT opened like around 168 Monday morning, it's 170.5 now...

Look at BABA, opened 203 Monday it's 209 now and that's a Chinese stock.

INTERFAX - A vaccine has been developed in the PRC that has previously shown efficacy against coronavirus, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui said on Monday. ""China has already developed a vaccine that shows immunity. But this is preliminary, further checks and refinements are needed,"" he said at a briefing at the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. Zhang Hanhui also reported effective medications found to treat coronavirus. ""Practice shows that Chinese medicines work effectively. In all cases when medicines are used, there has not been a single case of complications,"" he said. ""The overall effectiveness of Chinese medicines shows over 85%, in some areas more than 90%."""
