Because NFLX, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT are all up today.  NFLX is way higher than Monday morning.  MSFT opened like around 168 Monday morning, it's 170.5 now...

Look at BABA, opened 203 Monday it's 209 now and that's a Chinese stock.

INTERFAX - A vaccine has been developed in the PRC that has previously shown efficacy against coronavirus, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui said on Monday. ""China has already developed a vaccine that shows immunity. But this is preliminary, further checks and refinements are needed,"" he said at a briefing at the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. Zhang Hanhui also reported effective medications found to treat coronavirus. ""Practice shows that Chinese medicines work effectively. In all cases when medicines are used, there has not been a single case of complications,"" he said. ""The overall effectiveness of Chinese medicines shows over 85%, in some areas more than 90%."""

To make money in the market you need the will to stay with what you think is the right trade despite bad luck and the cool thinking to not get married to a position and switch when things start moving the other way.

You put in a little at a time on down days, so you will average down the cost and profit from the rebound. sell when the up days are pushing it.

but at the same time I also thought what if you bought only stuff that was making new highs? you'd always know it was on an uptrend. doesnt have to be yearly highs, could be 3 month or 1 month

Bear mods deleted my post. 

TSMC (traded as TSM) is the largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world supplying Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Huwaei chips.

Apple iPhone se2/iPhone 9 uses A13 chips manufacturered by TSM. Already exceeding demand, TSM increased production. Recent report from Taiwan is Coronavirus hasn't affected TSMs production line to a great extent. Still having the same guidance for the current quarter.

Apple is currently expecting to sell 20 million iPhone 9s in the next quarter.

TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. Apple is expected to sell over 100 million iPhone 12s this year and the A14 chip production starts soon, the best part is **TSM is the only company that can produce 3nm chips currently & TSM recently announced bear virus won't affect their production output and it's business asusual**

They are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.

TSMC Hires Ex-Intel Lobbyist to Deal With U.S.-China Tensions and continue supplying Huwaei.

July 17 & April calls are on sale for a short period of time. July 16 earnings going to kill and short term fluctuations won't affect your call. Have solid support on 53/54 and is due for a spike soon before Apple late March event.


Edit: **If you examine the return of the S&P 500 Index for each of the 23 election years since 1928, you'll see that in only four of them was it negative. Definitely 2020 is not going to be negative, TSM long calls are just Gold**"

I also loaded on MSFT 200 calls, nflx 420 calls, mdb 200c and a bunch of other position that I regret. I loaded last week at the peak.

Real estate agents can also purchase advertising with Zillow. Real estate agents will pay Zillow based on the number of ad impressions delivered to users. Mortgage lenders pay Zillow based on cost per click. Seems like a good business model and Zillow could become the AMZN of the real estate game if they can follow through on this. $z 65s 2/28"

President Trump asserted Monday that the coronavirus is “very much under control” in the United States, even as stock markets plunged amid concerns about the spread of the virus.

“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries,” Trump, who is traveling on official business in India, tweeted. “CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”"

I doubt any of you have money left in your accounts after today, but I think $FIZZ is worth a position so hear me out. Here's a quick summary of the why you should be interested:

* (1) Orders are currently tracking ahead of last years' pace after declining last year because of competition and a slanderous lawsuit. They introduced new flavors (Hi-Biscus, LimonCello, and Pasteque) that are doing well. (Source: [http://ir.nationalbeverage.com/static-files/d098e620-1c78-4573-82b9-8cc63f8deff7](http://ir.nationalbeverage.com/static-files/d098e620-1c78-4573-82b9-8cc63f8deff7)),
* (2) That slanderous lawsuit about the ingredients/labeling in La Croix was dismissed a few days ago and retracted by the plaintiff meaning it was fake and made up, (Source: [http://ir.nationalbeverage.com/static-files/921b1264-8d34-4859-ad6a-995f3443119e](http://ir.nationalbeverage.com/static-files/921b1264-8d34-4859-ad6a-995f3443119e)),
* (3) The company has no debt and $5/share in cash. Companies with no debt will hold up better in a down market,
* (4) The stock trades at 16.5x PE compared to other CPG/bverage peers at 20-30x (look at where Boomer brand Coke trades on a PE basis),
* (5) If the higher order trends continue then analyst EPS estimates for 2020 are too low and they will beat earnings + the multiple will re-rate to peer levels. At $2.50 of EPS and 20x PE that implies a stock price of $55 (including the $5 in cash/share),
* (6) There is always an option that they come out with an alcohol based La Croix to challenge White Claw. We all know that would cause the stock to probably double (could also partner with someone)
* And no, I am not trying to pump the stock because I am down on it. I initiated a position today because of the sell-off and since the news of the lawsuit just happened last week.

Get out of these tech stocks as most will be affected more than other sectors due to virus pressures. Tech is already overinflated and has had an insane run leading this bull run we've had. Before a massive sell off that people are hoping for, I would look for tech to fall 4-8% more as other sectors pick up. Then without data showing the virus is being contained, it could all follow down. But I expect the virus to be contained and medicines beginning to get tested, China is just a shit show.

That was one insane drop today. We broke through multiple supports and fell so far that we're now in a consolidation zone, which we traded within for the day. The ranges are approximately 320.25-324.25. If we can see daylight above 324.25, it won't signal a return to the bullishness or end of a correction--[it won't happen until we break the green line and bounce off it at least once](https://imgur.com/fOU4f5y)--so now is the time to gauge your trading strategy appropriately. 320.25 would be a decent spot to buy if you think a reversal is possible. If you think more downside is ahead, you would buy if you see weakness at around 328 short term, or right when we hit green crayon price trends. I will note it in future magical crayons.

VIX is in a dangerous zone. I'll post more about it tomorrow after I watch action, but if we don't break below 20.4 soonish I would be getting ready for some shit.
