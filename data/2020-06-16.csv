They don’t do either of those because most people don’t like pay increases for public workers (more taxes) and whenever states typically start a new policy like that, they don’t get enough people to apply.

The only people that have degrees that become police officers are doing so because it’s a jumping off point to transition to FBI/CIA/Homeland Security/Becoming a detective.

According to the media outlet, during a meeting held by the standing committee of the Beijing Municipal government, officials revealed the lockdown measures will expand to cover all neighborhoods, stressing the city should implement the most ""rigorous"" policies in order to curb further spread of the virus.

The decision comes after Beijing upgraded its coronavirus emergency response to level 2, over a spike in citywide cases. Previously, several neighborhoods in the Chinese capital were placed under lockdown due to clusters of infections found in areas, all linked to the Xinfadi wholesale market."

Futures roll quarterly. ESM0 (the current futures quarter contract) ends this friday when all futures contracts are settled and cash is credited or debited. ESU0 is the next ES futures contract that lasts till september. Investing is showing ESU0 already and thus there is a larger price disparity between spy and futures."

2020-06-17 07:36:56,smallchimpu,22,"#It's your boy chimpu, back with some updates and isights



Indian nifty is looking weak. ,up 0.2 %


Asia having over all a choppy day

Europe holding on to yesterdays gains and are slight green


Nikkie cooled down a bit after yesterday 4%+ dong rally


US futures kind of still holding yesterdays range


#Ranges of spy we will be dealing, 307 being a good support and 315 being resistance.


Introspective bias is that today will be contactionary day rather than expansionary, thus concluding that we will trade between 310 and 314


Personal recomdation : Don't hold derivatives position overnight and look forward to day trade

Small research say this is the season of small profit each trade with many trade


Today follow through is not looking on cards and most probably 2 points will be determined in first hour and we will trade between them through out today


For long term investors : market is still on up trend and vix on down trend when compared to previous month, so it's good time to purchase few stocks for long term, highly recommend SIP strategy to benefit the volitality


In medium term it's likely market might take breather each time NASDAQ touches all time high, so keep an eye on it, personal insight is that Nasdaq might consolidate between 9500 and 10000 for a while and most likely will break upwards, so keep an eye on that


Random tip of the day : '' support your position that is doing good by more funding rather than dollar averaging the one that is doing bad ""


Good luck traders and investors, I hope you have a good and profitable day

You get this wild fucking price action.  What we’re actually looking at is a war to pop the bubble but all the old tricks aren’t working.  

I think the bubble will pop, but it’s going to be the slowest pop you’ve ever seen.  As retail gets exhausted, bored, broke, or needs their stim checks back to pay rent, the sell off will gain momentum logarithmically.

Someone is going to take advantage of the  high prices and start selling. Realizing that it isn't going further up everyone will start selling. The 7am New York traders might hold but by 12:30pm the tide is definitely going to turn. Because it will only have half a day to fall, it will continue to fall over tomorrow night with a gap down. Thursday it will get to just above 300 and hold for a while.

Let me step inside the shoes of a bear for a moment: (let me know if this applies to you!) 

Its 3:59pm, you bought puts at like 310 or something retarded earlier in the day. After the inevitable EoD bull rampage, your puts are looking rough, down 30%. But no problem, you're a genius bear- it's time to average down. You cant print your way out of a recession after all! You get the order in at 3:59:59 on the dot. You nervously watch the AH action, but suddenly SPY begins to fade! Its down .5%! Your puts are about to print! Then, slowly but surely, the futures turn green. ""Lol gay fed"" you say to yourself. 3am now, futures are picking up steam, up a quarter of a percent. ""It won't hold"" you say. 

Fast forward now-its 6amEST. SPY has gapped up 4.5 points. You go to sleep, defeated. You wake up and its 11:15, you missed the open. SPY is now up a whopping 35 points on news that virus talks are going well. You sell your puts just as the red dildos come in for a sell program. 

How'd I do?"

After receiving the drink, I give the bartender a $5 tip, immediately chug it and put it down politely on the counter. Before I can request another, I see that a shapely female figure has appeared next to me. 

It's Tomi Lahren. ""What are you doing drinking a vodka/diet cran? Did they run out of (giggles) *SOY* milk?!"" 

I stand up, wipe the drops of cranberry juice off of my chin, lean in real close and whisper ""Tomi, if I were a liberal cuck, would I do this?"" as I gently place one hand on right hip and kiss her tenderly on the neck. 

""One kiss proves nothing"" she stammers. I rain kisses on her neck, as she throws her head back in ecstasy. ""Let's go to your place"" I whisper in-between kisses. She readily agrees and, to prove my manliness, I pick her up and lift her above my head like the dumb bell she is the entire way back to her place. 

After she pours us each a drink, we move to her bedroom. She lowers her Walmart-brand skirt and shrugs as if to say, ""this is me!""

I want the traders on my platform doing well and keeping their tendies on my books because I can still make money on their money regardless of the fees they pay.

But if my name rhymes with slobbingood, then I make my tendies from selling orderflow and maybe from traditional theta strategies. I don’t do traditional banking. My best interests are not aligned with the traders on my platform. The more they lose, the better I do.

Now as a leaf, I use bestraid as my brokerage even though it’s canada so I still get robbed on fees. But suddenly it seems more apparent why I seemingly more often get barely stopped out when using this brokerage than I do when using a traditional bank to trade?

Am I wrong in this analysis?"

2020-06-17 06:09:22,q112,10,"If I had three day trades that I was willing to waste tomorrow these would more than likely be my plays:

If DKNG is red red like it is right now I would buy some puts the second market opened, 34-36 range depending on how much you want to risk. DKNG gang has single ply toilet paper hands and would sell off if it looked like they had no chance of going green that day. 

If cruise lines are down big in the morning I’d wait about 15-30 minutes to eyeball the chart and if they look like they’re putting up a fight I would eventually buy calls, cruises have been hot and people are just going to see them as a discounted price and will buy them up. 

My last play and my golden rule, probably the most important rule, always, always, always, buy the DOCU dip. If DOCU dips in the morning for whatever reason (which it tends to do) whether it be the market, or the roo sell off, if DOCU dips let it dip as far as it can and pound calls like they’re your new stepsister. They only finished up .22% on the day today but at their low they were trading at 158.85 and hit 164.84 at its peak. DOCU always rebounds.


This is purely speculation and all of them would be sold off before the end of the day, I’ve got no plays right now and no day trades available until Thursday so basically I’m just fantasizing right now."

1) trend lately has been futures traders and market traders being at odds. Futures drop, market rallies at open. Futures rise, market drops at open.

2) Monday, we opened huge red and went green.


3) Today, we opened at 315 and were down from open all day, and the EOD rally only managed to bring it back to 313.


4) Futures tonight are sorta flat, but the downward pressure from 0% is pretty intense. Huge red dildo appears shortly after they go green.


Of course anything can happen, but it *kinda* seems like market traders and future traders are finally in agreement that this is the top for now.

He looked up into the sky and then back to me “stonks move little, but only so they can move big”. And I didn’t understand him so I asked “Mr Bull, what does it mean? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?”.

Alright listen up, outer banks has been a huge success for netflix and everyone is talking about it.

&#x200B;

Ford is releasing the 2021 bronco, we know it's going to be shaped like a jeep wrangler with a lot of the same features, the price is supposed to well undercut the wranglers. Bronco is going after the jeep wrangler and it could cause waves in the off road world. Now here is where things get crazy, The 2021 bronco trim lines got leaked, and the mid tier trim level name is, yup you guessed it, outer banks. I think the bronco is going to sell like crazy in the 2021 market. 

Now by the time season 2 comes out, because of the delay of covid-19 it's going to come out in 2022, or maybe even 2023, so by this time everyone will be seeing free marketing for netflix with the ford bronco outer banks trims driving around everywhere. Netflix and Ford are going to boost each other up with name recognition of outer banks

One day all of the money that I've earned, the collections that I've worked so hard on, the memories that I've made, it'll all be meaningless. 

I do not try to think like this, these thoughts intrude into my mind. I would like it to stop. I realize that one day my time will come, but when these thoughts come into my head I just shut down, usually it's just at night but sometimes it'll happen during the day. Sometimes it doesn't bother me and death is just a topic that comes up on conversation, but sometimes the severity of the subject comes to realization and I start freaking the fuck out.

2020-06-17 03:15:32,,34,"Here's a Robinhood dashboard-style watchlist for checking macro trends:


Inter-stock market:


SPY for total market


DIA for industrials


QQQ for tech


IWM for retail/smallcap


XLE for energy


XLF for finance


EEM for emerging markets


Indicators:


VIXY for VIX - indicates volatility, when this is on the rise, both puts and calls go up in price


IEF for treasury price (inverses treasury yield)


GLD for gold


DBC for commodities


Generally investors leave stocks for treasuries/gold when they are spooked, and vice versa, but sometimes you see all 3 up like we did when Asian money was coming out of Hang Seng and into the US due to turbulence in Hong Kong. Be wary of a dip recovery in equity prices that is not concurrent with a reversal in Treasuries/gold."

2020-06-17 03:07:40,,13,"Here's how to cook your weed into olive oil so you stop destroying your lungs.


You need: 


A casserole dish 


About 28g of weed 


About 300mL of olive oil 


Cheesecloth


Preheat your oven to 115 deg c (240 deg f). Coarse grind your weed and spread it out in your casserole dish. Dry bake your weed for exactly 40 minutes. This decarboxylates the THC so it becomes bioavailable. Remove dish from oven, add olive oil, stir. Set oven to 100 deg c (210 deg F) and bake for at least 40 minutes, no more than 90. This speeds up the transfer of cannabinoids to the olive oil. Remove from oven, stir, and let cool. Strain through cheesecloth, squeezing the oil out of the herb.


Voila! You now have approximately 250 mL of weed oil with approximately 10 to 20 mg of THC per ml. Take 1-2 mL (half a teaspoon) with food. You'll be high in an hour and a half and ripped for about 6 hours."

I shoot up from my pillow and rub my eyes. I look toward my ringing phone and see the red glow of my alarm clock: 2:32 AM. *Fuck me.*  

My blissfully dull job at the U.S. Mint has become anything but dull in recent weeks. All of my coworkers refer to themselves as ""artists,"" but it's really blue collar, menial labor. And my menial labor is maintenance on the printers.

Ever since COVID-19 hit the country, the Mint has been printing all day, every day. I told management that our ancient machinery couldn't perpetually run on inflation-mode, but they didn't want to hear it. That meant my 9-5 job became a 24/7 job.

My colleague on the phone begs me to come in. There's some kind of jam on the printers on the Benjamin line. I moan I'll be there shortly.

When I arrive, I immediately realize the problem isn't mine. The gears of the printers are flying smoothly, like a ticker that outperformed expectations on earnings day. I turn to my colleagues angry for waking me up, but then I notice the exhaustion in their faces, so I calmly say, ""Guys, did you check the ink?"" By the look on their faces, I can tell they haven't, and I just smirk at the thought of the pajama traders who are panic selling because of this hilarious oversight.

I walk with them to where the ink is loaded and, sure enough, the proprietary secret green cocktail is empty. Someone goes to grab more, then swiftly returns, flustered. ""We're out."" Another colleague, bewildered, tells them to stop joking. ""I'm not. There's no ink left.""

No ink left. I suddenly felt flush, remembering the night prior. After several rounds in the back of my Hertz rental car with him, my nameless hero, my genetic ink was all dried up, too. I could only make blanks, like the Benjamin line was now.

I say aloud, ""The printers need Gatorade and rest."" No one understands the joke. ""Just call Jerome. This is a problem only he can fix.""

In the mean time the money printer is more than paying for them with my calls. I feel like this is better than buying long dated puts because this way im not really screwed if the market goes up 15-20% in the time before the drop because im always moving with it every couple of days.

2020-06-17 01:36:12,MiltDavis,52,"The NCLH news is a really exciting development, gonna do a DD.

BTW SPYc at open until noon tomorrow (Fed hearing, Democratic), and dump em at the beginning of hearing and switch into VXX 6/19c until it goes up about 3% during the hearing.  Once it gets there sell it, buy the SPY resurgence post hearing and drop it EOD before it tapers around 3, 3:30.

Although overnight shit is exciting, it's too unpredictable moving forward because VXX always climbs from nervous markets, but 70% of overnight VXX gains/SPY loss are just wiped out anyway by pre-market trade pump, so the dice roll isn't worth it.  If you have day trade ability or a few round trips, just stick intraday.

**TLDR,** 

**If we open red and you can day trade:** VXX calls after SPY initial morning pump, dump mid-3/4 through hearing

**If we open red and you cannot day trade:** VXX 6/19 calls til Thursday open, sell the shits.

**if we open green: IF you can daytrade--** SPY 6/19c at open, dump at noon and buy VXX 6/19c, dump midway through hearing and buy SPY6/19 again you can ditch mid-day.  

**If you can't day trade and we open green:** SPY 6/19c at open, soldier through the bloodbath and hold until Friday when we swing out of the correction leg.

Thank you for taking the time to write in, this is something I can definitely help clear up for you!

We take great pride in the services we provide, and we completely understand if this experience did not meet your standards, as it fell well below our own.

Say you purchase 10 SPY calls.

Set up a Stop Loss on 5 of them:

\-20%, -25%, -30%, -35%, and -40% below what you paid.

Set up a Limit Sell on the other 5:

\+20%, +25%, +30%, +35%, and +40% above what you paid.

If your play ends up being wrong, you're at least protected from a complete loss. If your play ends up being correct, you have a system set up of insuring you're taking profit. You can obviously tweak your Stop Losses and Limit Sell orders to make the percentages higher or lower."

Bought calls at open last Friday cause markets were up so much. But for some reason markets kept declining and actually went red so I did the responsible thing and sold my calls, but the markets started going up rapidly so right before market close i bought calls again.

On Monday the markets were down heavily at open so I sold my calls for a lost and switched to puts but for some reason markets recovered and went green that day. I decided to stay disciplined though and held my puts because I figured the market would just reverse again so I held the puts overnight.

Today at market open I decided not to sell the puts for a loss but markets kept going up so before the close I sold my puts for a loss and switched back to calls so I really need a big green day tomorrow."

2020-06-16 22:14:18,CBarkleysGolfSwing,-6,"I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a son. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a boy for at least 18 years solely so he can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your handsome little boy - reading him stories at bedtime, making him go to sports practice, making sure he had a healthy diet, educating him, playing with him. All of it has one simple result: his body is more enjoyable for other men.

Raised the perfect boy? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way he grew up, who marries him. He gets to ravage him every night. He gets the benefits of his kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised him.

As a man who has a son, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a boy for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically."

$1 trillion Trump need for infrastructure 

$3 Trillion Mnuchin need for small businesses to support PPP

Another $10trillion of debt will be raised and serviced by kids, grand kids, great grand kids, great great grand kids etc.

Rigged data and rigged economy is currently running totally on steroid injection from Fed printing currency and congress raising debt of unmanageable magnitude to be serviced by kids, grand kids, great grand kid and great great grand kids etc


Do not care about rigged data and listen to any one Fed Jpow or any other and do not care about the amount of debt raised that is unsustainable level to GDP

$20 trillion of debts raised and Fed expanding balance sheet $4 trillion to $10 trillion

Fed Jpow said still more may be needed from congress and Fed to support the economy as there is significant uncertainty of strength and time of US economy recovery.

Inverse the Put/Call ratios everytime and you will win most of the time. The big boys don’t want to pay out massive amount of calls/puts. Last Thursday when shit dumped there were WAY more calls then puts for that day. And on Monday, there were way too many puts. I think this is a viable strategy and I used it friday/yesterday/and today and I’ve been up all three days. Could just be a lucky 3 days for me but I’d say this method will easily work 70% of the time.

EDIT: WSB Sentiment is used for my “ratios” you can look at the actual data on multiple websites but so far the last three days the sentiment from this subs discussion board correlates with the put/call ratios."

MIAMI, June 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (“Norwegian” or “the Company”) (NYSE: NCLH), a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, today announced an extension of its previously announced suspension of global cruise voyages to include all voyages embarking between August 1 and September 30, 2020 for its three cruise brands. The voyage cancellations exclude September Seattle-based Alaska voyages. The Company is also cancelling select voyages through October 2020, including Canada and New England sailings, due to travel and port restrictions. The Company will continue to work in tandem with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal government and global public health authorities to take all necessary precautions to ensure the health, safety and security of guests, crew and the communities visited. 

Guests who are currently booked on cancelled voyages on Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises or Regent Seven Seas Cruises are asked to contact their travel advisor or the cruise line for more information."

I kept it pretty small since I didn’t want to risk my main investment account. I applied for options/margin trading on my Vanguard account and now have $400,000 available to work with. 

I don’t need gigantic gains, but I’d like feedback on my strategy starting tomorrow. I’m planning on selling cash covered puts on SPY for about $7-10 below market value after 11AM with a same day execution. Even though it has been volatile, We haven’t seen that much of a drop after the early morning fluctuations. I figure I can get about $600-1,000 a day (10 contracts X 100 shares X ~$300 strike) consistently this way. If I consistently work with this strategy, I could make over $100,000 by the end of the year. That would be about a 50% gain on my base investment. Even taking off taxes and the fee for using margin funds, this seems like a great idea to me. 

What am I missing here?"
