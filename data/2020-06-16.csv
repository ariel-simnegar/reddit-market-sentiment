According to the media outlet, during a meeting held by the standing committee of the Beijing Municipal government, officials revealed the lockdown measures will expand to cover all neighborhoods, stressing the city should implement the most ""rigorous"" policies in order to curb further spread of the virus.

The decision comes after Beijing upgraded its coronavirus emergency response to level 2, over a spike in citywide cases. Previously, several neighborhoods in the Chinese capital were placed under lockdown due to clusters of infections found in areas, all linked to the Xinfadi wholesale market."
