I think Trump knew about the pandemic out of China, and also understood you can not stop it.

Trump has been wanting easy money from the Fed for quite some time.

Also, maybe even the Fed was in on this, they acted quite fast on the response here, it’s a way for the bubble to pop, but without having to have admit fault. “Act of God” type excuse, a variable that can not be equated for.

Basically, I think the Fed/Trump had been worried about the economy and are somewhat happy they can have this virus take the fall for sloppy fiscal policy.

Idk, feel free to add on to the theory.

There’s just no way the CIA or CDC didn’t brief how serious this was when it was still in China, and for fuck sake Rome was LITERALLY on FIRE for like 3 days.

Fucking idiot Trump gives out a tax break while we were at full employment fueling the enquity bubble. Since social security isn't backed by an investment fund it's been slowing real growth forever.

Lyft and Uber have no business floating at $21 when they’re unable to turn a profit even in the best of times. I’d consider buying shares as $10 and even then you’re gambling they make it out of this.

2020-03-22 23:45:28,zg44,10,"Gotta be honest, past week I was hopeful that as the US ramped up testing, we would see that the US outbreak wasn't as bad as Europe's...  Instead, we're basically looking at a similar outbreak here with New York shaping up to be another Italy; the NY numbers are a total disaster, no positive spin is even possible there.

Bottom is probably below S&P 2000 now even with the mega bailout from Congress probably on the way by next week.  Throw all the levels out the window now; technicals don't matter when the economy is basically collapsing.  All Congress can do is try to keep businesses/consumers afloat with bailouts across the board.

It's just hard to describe how bad the next 6-10 weeks will be for the US economy; unemployment is going to hit 10% at least, and many businesses won't be able to re-open in a couple months.  We're also going to see the total case number hit 100k+ and the number of deaths in the US and Europe will skyrocket.  

This recession is looking like it will end up being deeper than 2008-2009, and I don't say that lightly since that was the worst recession since the Great Depression.  To have two of these types of deep recessions in one generation is just horrific to people of all ages.

The only silver lining is that theoretically we could be past the recession in 6 months..., but that isn't going to be of much solace if a lot of businesses don't make it and there's a lot of dislocation of workers that isn't quickly repaired."

*Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $173, down from $256. The stock closed Friday down 3% to $95.01. Boeing will remain a going concern, and travel by flight will be ""as popular as ever"" once the COVID-19 outbreak is resolved, Poponak tells investors in a Sunday night research note. As such, the analyst thinks Boeing shares, which are down 70% year-to-date and 80% from 2019 highs, should be ""procured at the current price."" With its current cash balance and the term loan drawn in Q1, plus the remaining revolver and a temporary dividend halt, Boeing has adequate liquidity to cover a ""deeply negative"" free cash flow year in 2020, which includes no MAX deliveries until Q4 and airlines deferring deliveries as well as asking for a pre-delivery-payment holiday, says Poponak. In addition, federal assistance to both the airlines and to the aerospace manufacturing sector is possible, adds the analyst. On top of that, Poponak believes a MAX certification flight could occur near-term, calming liquidity fears.*"

UPDATE: 2days later, 🔴79%-21%🟢. Futures 
halted 4min into the session. It’s looking more and more like an extra bloody 🩸Monday! NY has more than 15,000 🍺🦠 cases that’s more than 🇰🇷and 🇫🇷! 🇺🇸 now 3rd in # of 🍺🦠 cases, behind 🇨🇳 & 🇮🇹...

[RESULTS from weekly poll](https://imgur.com/gallery/MOmxqql) - SPY closed at $229, 26% of you were correct!

What a week! We had the worse week since the financial crisis in 2008, still many of you made crazy money 💰! You autists we’re 50-50 on this last poll was. It’s crazy how accurate this poll has been! Total: you’ve been correct the last 9 polls, 1 incorrect & 3 (50-50)!

Happy for all you autists who made good money this week! For me, it was the worse week I’ve had since I started trading. Lost about 🔻-38% of my portfolio but it’s all good! Life is good, at least I don’t have the 🍺🦠! I’m sure I’ll make up for it next week! 💰🚀You autists are awesome, glad to be part of this autistic community that makes crazy tendies 💵, gives to charity, sometimes looses some then makes it all all back and more. 😎 

Stay 🍺🦠free and have an awesome weekend! 

#Cheers WSB boys!🍻"
