AMC Stock (Up like 3%, holding). Undervalued, looks to be reversing the trend. Might buy some calls. Holding Long Term, I will increase my holdings.

AKORN Stock (up 20%, shoulda fucking got calls on this instead). Very Undervalued. Might exit but I think the uptrend will continue as controversy doesn't mean the stock is worthless.

CONN Calls/stock (Down \~8%. Holding for rebound). Very Undervalued. Have calls for Feb 21st. Will sell on a good jump."
