2020-01-14 17:20:35,MangoManBad,1,"Bullish on

AMC Stock (Up like 3%, holding). Undervalued, looks to be reversing the trend. Might buy some calls. Holding Long Term, I will increase my holdings.

AKORN Stock (up 20%, shoulda fucking got calls on this instead). Very Undervalued. Might exit but I think the uptrend will continue as controversy doesn't mean the stock is worthless.

CONN Calls/stock (Down \~8%. Holding for rebound). Very Undervalued. Have calls for Feb 21st. Will sell on a good jump."

2020-01-14 01:48:01,murzzzz,1,"Buy more Nantkwest (NK) if you feel like rolling the dice on a biotech.  Popped 90% right before close and has potential for a moonshot with phase 1b showing complete response in a pancreatic cancer patient.  Other patients showed partial response (I believe n=10).  I believe total trial n=300, a bit curious why the CEO only shared data on 10... very early results?

None the less, pancreatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and has one of the worst prognosis for treatment.  Anything that shows complete response, even in 1 out of 10 patients is extremely interesting.  Unique thing about NK is that they are using a novel (to my knowledge) approach to cancer treatment using NK cells that are easier to manufacture than monoclonals or CAR-T.  Could have potential to be used in combination with existing drugs on the market, which, IMO has big buy out potential from one of the big boys.  Its still very early and there could be a myriad of issues, like a disastrous safety event, or ultimately unfavorable data.  This disclaimer should be baked in to any clinical stage data.

These biotech runs have played out over a few days so there may still be room to move up.  As always, its a big roll of the dice, premiums have spiked 300%+ be careful, but overall exciting news if the results do actually pan out!  YMMV."

2020-01-14 01:18:31,psytokine_storm,3,"Anyone still in RAD? I've been getting my DCA down with covered calls. Down to $13.8. I expect this is going to be rangebound $11-$14 until 2 weeks before Mar earnings, at which time I'll stop selling options, and maybe buy some calls while holding shares. 

Before then, I intend to wait for spikes up to $13.5ish to sell $14 covered calls with a 2 weeks expiry. Those typically have a 60 cent premium.

Thoughts?"

2020-01-13 21:23:14,oregon_forever,4,This reminds me of 2017-2018. In 2017 the market rallied bigly all year because of Fed and tax cuts and it continued into January of 2018. The market rallied almost every single day of January but then had a sharp correction at the end of the month and the market didn't really do much the rest of the year. Will it repeat? Nah. SPY will double in 2-3 years.

JPM 139/141 call debit spread for if bank earnings are good.(Risk to reward was 1 to 2.4, and if JPM goes to 140 that just puts it right back in the upwards trending channel it was already in until last week).

I'm biased to the upside, particularly for bank earnings since the market hasn't stopped going up this quarter.

I'll continue to hold my BYND 2021 $40C that I bought for $40 each. This run is ridiculous, but the amount of short interest in the stock was ridiculous too. The vast majority of this run up so far has been short covering. I wouldn't be surprised if we see $180 before all is said and done, but we'll also see some -5% to -10% days mixed in there. I'd be looking to play small value FD call moonshots and selling OTM put credit spreads on the red days. Sell your winners for profit on the green days."

GRAPEVINE, Texas, Jan. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (GME), today reported sales results for the nine-week holiday period ended January 4, 2020.

Total global sales from continuing operations for the holiday period were $1.83 billion, a 27.5% decrease compared to the 2018 nine-week holiday period ended January 5, 2019. Total comparable store sales for the nine-week period decreased 24.7%, following a 1.5% increase in comparable store sales for the similar period in fiscal 2018. Sales results during the holiday period are indicative of overall industry trends impacting the video game industry and driven by an accelerated decline in new hardware and software sales, particularly in the month of De­­­cember."
