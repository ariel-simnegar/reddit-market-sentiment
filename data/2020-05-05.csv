Huge opportunity in remote/software based learning and they’ve been handing out free licenses right and left to schools across the US since March (this costs them nothing and it’s sticky from subscriber sense, payments start in July). This stock doesn’t screen well but is in great shape financially.

Oh and their silly language business (which is extremely high margin) is likely also booming, just looking at google search trends on “Rosetta Stone” and “learn language”. This is a SaaS that is usually written off completely from ER perspective because calendar q1 is quiet, so there’s not much expectation here.
