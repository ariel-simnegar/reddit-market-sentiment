Huge opportunity in remote/software based learning and they’ve been handing out free licenses right and left to schools across the US since March (this costs them nothing and it’s sticky from subscriber sense, payments start in July). This stock doesn’t screen well but is in great shape financially.

Oh and their silly language business (which is extremely high margin) is likely also booming, just looking at google search trends on “Rosetta Stone” and “learn language”. This is a SaaS that is usually written off completely from ER perspective because calendar q1 is quiet, so there’s not much expectation here.

More than the clarity of purpose, WSB has given me a jolt to actualize my vision. WSB has taught me how to focus all my energies on a singular goal. Imagine caring about daily progress towards your ideal self as much as you care about +-0.1% swings in futures.

WSB trained me to be obsessed with my goals to the point that I ask myself every minute how my current actions are helping me become the best version of myself. More than the money I've made and the laughs and entertainment, I appreciate your single minded dedication and obsession the most. Redirecting that obsession to my personal goals has resulted in progress faster than I would have ever imagined possible.

Think about it everyone making oil is going to have to blow tons of cash bidding up storage the longer they pump, and from what I've read Texas isn't even really slowing down? This isn't sustainable for any player. Okay so fine US Shale goes BK but it's a long BK, Oxy today wants to renegotiate their 40 billion in debt or whatever and that is ONLY possible in a world where J Pow is printing like a mad man. Read an article about some banks setting up companies to run oil assets from companies that have gone BK. Saudi/Russia could be fighting the biggest printer in the world

diluted EPS = 0.44 = missed estimates of 0.55 but because of dumb interest rate derivative - i assume was meant to be hedge, otherwise they beat estimates \~0.57 vs estimated 0.55

EBTDA (after interest expense) = roughly same as cash from ops = \~116m

dividend = 47m = 0.35 per share (5% return based on current $7 share price) due to prepayment of 58m worth of debt

Overall solid quarter even with minimal uplift from contango-caused inflated prices - adjusted TCE for quarter = 65.5k vs 4Q19 TCE of 63.9k

Outlook for 2Q:

Currently QTD looks like they did \~165m in adj. net revenue already at TCE of 88k - extrapolated to full quarter based on days should be around 222m (up 260% yoy)

adj. EBITDA probably will be \~178m based on 80% EBITDA margin over last 2 quarters

cash from ops / EBTDA = 166m (before working cap adjustments), after debt payments due = \~148m - this is money that can be reinvested, paid as dividend or pay down debt

Their dividend payout policy is \~60% of earnings (1Q was \~65% at 47m paid out of 72m in earnings). I estimate their earnings to be \~135m therefore 60% is 80m, implying a dividend per share of 0.55

Combined with the 1Q dividend, that would be $0.9 = 13% return on $7 share price.

Everybody depends on the government and the whole economy is designed to squeeze as much as they can from private companies, eliminating any incentive to grow,

They depend on tourism like crazy and one bad year is enough to crash the fucking economy. Millions of people work 6 months during the summer season and receive government subsides the other 6 months. This people don't have savings and have a high levels of debt with car payments and multiple credit cards.

The pension system is literally a pyramid scheme where current employees are paying the pensions of the retired people. There are no savings or anything, as a matter of fact they have to incur more debt every year to keep paying the pensions.

The average pension is 1000€ and the median salary of a worker is 1350€. They kept this system alive because there was a fuck ton of boomers contributing and not that many grandpas getting the pension. In 2 years this boomers start retiring in the millions and guess who is gonna pay for their pensions? It's literally impossible because for every 4 boomers expecting to receive a 1200€ pension you have 1 sad millennial in the workforce with a $1000 salary.

Europe is gonna implode within the next 2 years and the euro will follow creating the biggest crash we have seen in the last 50 years."

What would you autists do with an extra few hundred bucks every day? If your answer isn't scrape lines of Fun Dip onto an Argentinian hooker's ass and snort away while flapping your arms like Owl wings and HOOTING like a motherfucking owl, you're doing this wrong.

2020-05-06 00:45:33,,9," Being a bear, it's pretty fuckin annoying when other amateur bears bust a nut and claim victory early. Especially when futures are like -0.10% or some shit, and say some truly idotic stuff like ""bull r fuk"", ""dril"", ""bull r stupid"" or what have you. You youngins dont even remember when futures opened with a limit down and markets opened green af.

Clearly you have not been around long enough to experience what a true drill looks like in real-time. When futures or market ACTUALLY drills, everyone will know it and there won't be any need to announce it. Not only that, but you amateur bears will be too frozen and shocked to even sell your puts let alone post silly shit like this.

The reason RTX stock is so screwed up right now is because all the experts are putting out misinformation in garbage articles like this. RTX is the only stock I've ever seen get a no compete 10 billion dollar contract and another 487 million contract in one week and the same week the stock drop $11. People have NO Idea what the new companies financials look like but have no problem putting out fraudulent numbers. RTX PE is not 18.08 so Zacks is BS. The new company will be putting out it's first financial report on 5/7 but Zacks is spreading fake numbers tanking the stock. UT was worth 100 billion when the merger of equals was approved and spun off Ottis and Carrier at a 40 billion evaluation leaving UT at a valuation at 60 billion with Raytheon at 60 billion which are both way undervalued at 60 billion. Anyhow you combine them and you have a 120 billion dollar company but some how the new stock was priced at $53 meaning a 79.5 billion valuation????? Humm- So where did the other 40 billion of value go? Some insiders got their RTX pretty cheap. Raytheon was valued at over 100 billion 6 months ago and UT was at 160 billion but now the new company combined is only worth billion 88 billion by today's stock price? This stock should be a minimum $75 per share and could be $100 in the next 12 months. The stock is being totally manipulated right now trying to force the little guys to sell their stocks at rock bottom prices to survive the CONVID-19. RTX stock will mysteriously rebound and be $70+ in the new month or 2."

I spent more time watching +- 0.1% movements on futures than I did thinking about general trends and plays that seem obvious 100 baggers in hindsight. Nevertheless, the last 2 months were very entertaining thanks to WSB and I made money while having fun.

My short break from trading is helping me recognize plays that typically fly under the radar. I have been reading the Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness, the Box, and AnitFragile, they have helped me systemize my thought process and bring more clarity to my life and to my trading.

Is there any evidence MM will pay for short sellers to attack outperforming small stocks?  I owned near the money options that mooned 150%+ on INO, then some short-sellers started throwing their poop at it and it kinda gave up a lot of those gains.

The short selling attack had no basis in science, aside from the fact that yes it's possible someone else will dominate the vaccine space before INO could manufacture enough (and maybe the vaccine doesn't work, but INO has had success with MERS vaccine in trials so far).

However, INO dropping sure would be convenient for whichever butthurt call writers sold options only to see the stock soar nearly 2x in a week and become like the #1 Robinhood stock

I'm sure it's probably just that Andrew Fuckwit (""Citron Research"") and his fellow travelers saw a speculative stock that investors could be scared away from if enough big words and comparisons to Theranos were used.

With that said tho, I get the vibe that we are heading towards another immanent market crash. I know much of the fundamentals have not changed in a week or so, but it definitely seems like investor sentiment has and it began with Buffett's conference call this Saturday. Now that the economy is opening back up, I think one major setback will set this whole thing backwards again because I feel as if investors are getting spooked again and will react towards the first  bit of negative news. Hope I'm wrong tho. Thoughts?"

$MTCH, and $GRUB

$MTCH: owns almost every major dating app and website. Online dating is growing more and more popular in an increasingly digital age. Many women feel more comfortable meeting a man on online dating websites than a cold approach in a bar or club. People are more and more often ok with monthly subscriptions as well and Tinder Gold preys hard on lonely men with increased monthly prices based by age. The benefits are also quite nice. They also own all the major upper class dating websites like Match and OkCupid, these make a ton of money from businessmen with deep pockets.

$GRUB: food delivery is all the rage nowadays and quickly replacing traditional restaurants for many people. More and more are people ditching drink and server costs and instead opting to order food delivery while having a nice family night at home. People also use it out of laziness and to get food for their children as well as special occasions. The food market is massive, averaging 3 meals a day, the city of NYC eats 25 million meals a day. There are only 2 competitors to grubhub, split evenly that’s 8.3 million meals a day they have access to in the city of New York alone. I’m also a grubhub driver and I can tell you firsthand we are insanely busy. I’ve delivered back to back orders, often times double orders, every hour of every day for 2 weeks straight. Massive boost from quarantine but even beforehand these services were growing in popularity.

Both have earnings after hours tomorrow so they’ll be a nice run up before a huge take off when earnings come out."

According to Powell's [2019 financial disclosure](https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/B7B81E8D7ED5CA51852584040027DABB/$FILE/Jerome-H-Powell-2019-278.pdf), his net worth could run as high as $55 million. Much of his investments are with Goldman Sachs (a Wall Street bank that is supervised by the Fed) or with BlackRock and its iShares Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The government mandated financial disclosures report investment values in a range. The upper value of Powell’s holdings with BlackRock is $11.6 million. The upper range of Powell’s holdings with Goldman Sachs is $16.55 million. The name Goldman Sachs has been shortened to “GS” in the disclosure document.

TLDR: buy GS, BlackRock and iShares. Follow the corrupt men to make easy money."
