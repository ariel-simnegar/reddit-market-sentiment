2020-08-26 08:39:33,JimboTheSimpleton,7," Quantity Theory of Money  and The Case of the Missing Inflation

Despite the printer going brrrrr we have not seen a lot of inflation ([source](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2015/10/which-measures-of-inflation-are-relevant-for-policy/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog)) o,r at least , we have not seen a  clear pattern of a lot of inflation. 

&#x200B;

The Quantity Theory of Money

M*V=P*Y

where M=Money Supply, V=Velocity of money(transactions per unit time), P=Price Level and Y=GDP.

Now, the pandemic has caused a major contraction in GDP, a good deal of the decrease in GDP is the loss of the value of services which were not and now cannot be preformed. We can't get those months back. Additionally the printer has been going brrrr increasing the money supply, M. Now  we have not yet seen large increase in the price level. So why haven't we seen it? The answer is that the velocity of money has dropped like a rock with so many people out of work and so many business closed. V has plummeted. ([Source](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog))

When things open up again, the velocity of money is going to rise and with it , the price level will rise (inflation) with it as we can not get back the lost months of service GDP. We are sitting on a mountain of unrealized inflation. At least according to my interpretation of the quantity theory of money. I would be interested to learn your guys' thoughts though."

2020-08-26 07:43:18,BananasGorilla_,8,"How shareholders have fared with previous Apple splits

Apple has split its stock several times in the past. In general, investors have taken the news positively, reflecting optimism about the overall market and Apple's particular growth prospects.

In 2014, Apple announced plans to do a 7-for-1 stock split. Investors had roughly six weeks to consider whether they wanted to buy Apple shares prior to the split or wait until after it became effective.

What happened six years ago was that Apple's stock price climbed steadily in the weeks leading up to the split. After it happened, there was a brief but significant push higher in the share price. However, after a few days, that trend reversed itself, and the stock briefly eased lower before resuming its general upward trend.

When you look back further, you see similar trends. In early 2005, Apple decided to do a more conventional 2-for-1 stock split. The stock really started to pick up steam in the weeks leading up to the stock split, and there was a brief push higher immediately following the effective date of the move. For a couple of weeks after the split, Apple shares sagged, but then they started moving higher again.

Things didn't always work out that way with Apple splits, but then, markets aren't always in the same place more broadly. In mid-2000, Apple did a 2-for-1 stock split, but the stock market had begun to slip into the bear market pullback following the internet stock boom. Apple's share-price appreciation prior to the split was more muted, and lasting gains proved more elusive as the tech giant generally followed the broader market's downward trend."

Suddenly savings are worth less,  and banks are also less likely to loan money to the average consumer because the the markets are safer with a greater return even when accounting for risk than loaning money to a small business at an extremely low interest rate that may barely beat inflation. 

This policy feels like it‚Äôs accelerating the widening wealth gap, and it will come to a head for us as a society at some point. The top 1% own 56% of equities and the top %10 own 88% of equities

Personally my businesses are jacked to the tits in debt and we are luckily in a position to continue being profitable, so this if anything will have a positive impact on my financial future but at what cost?

1. Abuse the networks connectivity. People come here for wisdom of the crowds type shit.

2. Trick the algos. The more weird chirps and clicks the algos understand as the tickers and positivity the more monolithic digital entities churn the wealthiest segment of our population's treasure into literal garbage WSB approved penny-non penny stocks. Sadly stupid fucking cunts like you also fall for the pump and dump and sadly don't understand that the dump is unpredictable to you by design.

 Fire exits. Mob rule. Panic.

So, I looked into some research, and I welcome you to review it as well. Basically, the more emotion and the more population the worse the wisdom of the crowd performs. Do with this info as you will.

Turns out even retards can get Nobel prizes, according to their fancy mathematical model the chance that all their positions could be down, triggering massive margin calls, was close to 0%. Trusting this retarded math they kept taking on more and more leverage. 

The first few years they were making bank. First year over 20% return, second year over 40% return, third year over 40% return.

Guess what happened next? Market doesn't care about your Nobel Prize math. First in 1997 Asian financial crisis hits they lose millions. Their models convince them to DOUBLE DOWN, take on even more leverage and risk.

You can already guess what happened next, in 1998 Russia decided to default out of nowhere causing massive shock and huge market volatility spike all over the world, they lost $5 billion in 1990 dollars that year.

Moral of the story = **If Noble prize winning mathematicians, creators of the options formula that they still teach at universities fail at TA and DD this hard, what's the point?**

He fixed it and WE never had that problem again.

2020-08-26 03:05:03,waylon106,-2,"Ray Dalio

Let‚Äôs talk about another success story.

Ray Dalio grew up in a middle-class Long Island neighbourhood and got involved with the markets at the age of 12. He collected money by getting tips as a golf caddy. Most of the golfers he caddied for worked on Wall Street and that‚Äôs what got him interested in the world of trading stocks.

He earned his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1975 and went on to launch the investment company Bridgewater from his two-bedroom apartment in New York city.

The company‚Äôs success skyrocketed in the ‚Äò80s and by 2011 it would turn into the largest hedge fund in the entire world.  Today, the hedge fund firm manages about $160 billion in assets.

He also predicted the global financial crisis in 2007 and further explained his model in an essay titled ‚ÄúHow the Economic Machine Works: A Template for Understanding What Is Happening Now.‚Äù His net worth is an astonishing $12.5 Billion.

In addition to his renowned essay, he also published a book, titled ‚ÄúPrinciples,‚Äù praised by many investors and traders from all over the world. In his book, he explains in detail the philosophy behind his investments as well as corporate management, based on his own corporate experiences and self-analysis.

Some of the principles he advocates to younger businessmen and traders are to keep their integrity, listen and observe more experienced traders, and analyse events.

Moreover, he shares that money was never an important part of his life but rather it led to an exciting and memorable life.

Ray Dalio has always been one of those investors who loves sharing his success with others. He has given over $700 million to various philanthropic causes. Moreover, the Dalio Foundation supports inner-city education, microfinance and nature conservation."

2020-08-26 02:43:21,waylon106,4,"David Tepper

David Tepper is often referred to as one of the greatest hedge fund managers of all time and for a reason.

David Tepper was born in 1957 in the East-end of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated with honours in Economics and started experimenting with investments from a very young age.  

Tepper started his career as a credit analyst and started developing his sense of money management and investing. He built up his career after carefully observing and learning the credit structure of a company that is experiencing financial troubles. 

He became popular for picking up distressed companies and transforming them into profitable ventures due to the knowledge he obtained. He also bought bonds from banks on the verge of a bankruptcy during the late ‚Äò80s. After the banks survived the bond market crash, he made a lot of money due to his investments.

He is also famous for founding the Tepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund firm in the early ‚Äò90s which currently manages over $15 Billion.

In addition to being one of the most praised names in the investment world, Tepper is known in the philanthropic world, giving back to society. He continues to donate great amounts of money to schools, universities, academic centres and scholarship programs."

The sell off and buy back cycle has engineered everyone to hold. It was a good strategy by the powers that be. Now next time some shit hits the fan, like a subsequent shut down, or schools closing, people will hold on and not sell when there is every reason to.

I open my DoorDash app and order some Chinese food from Taco Bell United. The app is linked to my Tesla. My Tesla quietly rolls out of my driveway and parks in the mobile order pick up spot and rolls down the passenger window. An employee earning the minimum wage of $375/hour brings the food out and places it in the car. My Tesla drives back and my phone alerts me my food has arrived. Thank God they are still letting us work from home.

You are a unique person that doesn't need to tie your existence to any one thing. Wait a day or two to hit the bong or the trade button and see how much more satisfying it is.

When I mentioned to him that I have a pressure washer in my garage just sitting there, he told me that I should start charging people $100 an hour to pressure wash their home(they provide the water).

 My question is:

Would I look suspicious walking door-to-door asking people if they need their  homes pressure washed? I already have a good sales pitch(I think) trying to convince people that a small $100 increase  their homes curb appeal and property value. What do you think?"

2020-08-26 01:50:09,waylon106,4,"James Simons

James Simons is surely one of the most intriguing figures on our list because, in addition to being a billionaire hedge fund manager, he is also a mathematician and quantitative investor, known for his famous studies on pattern recognition and string theory development. In the trading community, he is known as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs smartest billionaire‚Äù.

James Harris Simons was born in 1938 in Newton, Massachusetts. As a teenager, he worked in a garden supply store. Determination, curiosity and hard work, however, earned him his PhD in Mathematics at the young age of 23.

His dreams to combine his passion for mathematics and trading led him to establish a team of professors, scientists and engineers who built an algorithm to predict any change in the price of a financial instrument. His ideas became the foundation of what we call today the ‚Äúquantitative investor‚Äù.  

James Simons founded the famous Renaissance Technologies, which made him a billionaire and became one of the world's most successful hedge fund companies.
He is an expert in pattern recognition. He uses mathematical models to help him analyse hedge funds and end up with more accurate predictions than any other method. He is considered a true hero because as previously mentioned, he achieved such enormous success in a field other than mathematics by heavily utilising his mathematical knowledge.

He is also a generous philanthropist - it has been estimated that he has given over $2.7 billion to various philanthropic causes over his lifetime.

His current net worth has been estimated to over $20 billion.

Travel sectors won‚Äôt go up and stay up till there‚Äôs a real vaccine in production, and being administered to the American public. 

The only travel play you should be looking at is buying puts during pumps, or actual stock on beaten down companies.

**Context -**

The S&P 500 (+0.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) rose to record highs today. The market found continued support in the mega-caps following a disappointing consumer confidence report. 

Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 84.8 in August (consensus 93.0) from 91.7 in July for its lowest reading since May 2014.

Presumably, there were some concerns that the decline in consumer confidence would translate to less consumer spending, absent another round of fiscal stimulus. In addition, the report overshadowed new home sales showing a marked increase of 13.9% m/m in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 (consensus 787,000).

Amazon (AMZN 3346.49, +39.03, +1.2%), Facebook (FB 280.82, +9.43, +3.5%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1608.22, +20.02, +1.3%), which have performed well throughout the pandemic, posted strong gains after a slow start. Apple (AAPL 499.30, -4.13, -0.8%) was a notable exception. 

In key stock news, Salesforce (CRM 216.05, +7.59, +3.6%), Amgen (AMGN 248.22, +12.65, +5.4%), and Honeywell (HON 164.53, +5.16, +3.2%) will replace Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.89, -1.33, -3.2%), Pfizer (PFE 38.41, -0.43, -1.1%), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX 60.95, -0.93, -1.5%) in the Dow 30 average prior to the open on Aug. 31.

The change was enacted to account for Apple's 4:1 stock split, as its lower price would reduce the price-weighted Dow's exposure to the technology sector.

The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.01. WTI crude futures rose 1.7%, or $0.72, to $43.33/bbl.

Investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.

After experimenting with various greeks, strikes, and expirys...I believe we may finally have an answer:

1. Toss tendies in 1-7 DTE batter...7-14 DTE works too.


2. Dip them in a rub with low IV...the lower, the better.


3. Shake 'em in OTM strikes...the further OTM, the spicier.


4. Fry them with a limit order...market orders will ruin your tendies.


5. Let them cook until they are golden brown (100+%) or burned to a crisp (-99%)


*Results will vary


OPTIONAL


1. Take a screenshot of your tendies and share it with the WSB community. 


2. Be sure to use the ""Gain"" flair for well done tendies and ""Loss"" flair for burned tendies."

2020-08-25 20:23:08,xesus2021,7,"I have to ask... Is anyone else starting to get shit scared?

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Guys be careful, for real."

2020-08-25 20:18:38,GourmetFilet,30,"That CRM beat and pump was all i needed to see. About a two years ago CRM had a huge beat and surged, before the market even opened the next day CRM pissed away all its gains and the market overall slid hard. I said omg just my fucking luck. I was a fresh new fish swimming in a tide that was much too strong. 

Exactly one year later I decided to play CRM ER again. Huge beat sky and skyrocketed. The day after that? The infamous Trump Tweet day where he warned all american companies to find alternative supply chains to China and consider bringing their operations to America. The market dipped very hard and CRM was a casualty. 

I have been keeping tabs on CRM as I always use their products for work and like to see how it does. Not kidding, for the past two years (8 ERS) the day after CRM ER is a big red day for the market. 

This is my DD. Tomorrow is going to be rough."
