Imo they've (the government and the Fed) acted both quickly and decisively here (ECONOMICALLY!). The latter is key; in 2008 they only intervened after Bear Sterns' collapse, by which time panic had become baked into the system.

This time before any significant economic and financial fallout they've reduced rates, reserve requirements and are shoring up the market for commercial paper to ensure firms have sufficient liquidity. In conjunction with the $850bn economic stimulus package the government are going to pass, and also further measures to save, for example, the airlines, the government and central bank (finally!) are showing some credibility.

Once the number of cases begins to plateau (and potentially even before that), we might see a huge uptick in the SPY when the realisation kicks in in the market that, thanks to speedy, powerful action, we might have got out of this one relatively unscathed economically. Especially with what Trump just announced (the $1000 check to all Americans potentially), I think it's likely we come out of this one very positively.

Check this article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-01/u-s-banks-bad-debt-pile-creeps-higher-with-credit-card-losses

Most important quotes: 

‚ÄúFor now, there‚Äôs no cause for panic. The strong U.S. economy and low unemployment means most consumers are able to stay current on debt payments‚Äù



‚ÄúBig banks are also stressing that loss levels aren‚Äôt outside the range they expected. Some of the deterioration in credit quality comes from growth‚Äù

‚ÄúCredit-reporting company Experian Plc said some of the blame goes to banks offering credit to riskier borrowers, and the Federal Reserve has noted a spike in late payments by the elderly.‚Äù


Big Short parallels: 

‚òëÔ∏èexpansion to more risky borrowers to create growth
‚òëÔ∏èBanks see increased loss ahead of time but ‚Äúaren‚Äôt outside range expected‚Äù (yet)


And now we‚Äôre going to see a crunch on consumer cash. In pretty much every average American household.

Banks are down, but this can‚Äôt be priced in yet, right? Millions of people and small business won‚Äôt be able to pay credit cards and loans.

How do I find out who owns the most credit card ABS?"

Rest assured, however, I've carried the way of life into this new outlet and am currently limited by RH PDT status so taking action across brokerage accts - and it just so happens we've been largely aligned over the past several weeks.

Have ridden the market down in $SPY/$DIA puts.  Covering my initial 'investment' on the sidelines and constantly rolling profits into more YOLO's as Trump administration just continues to give us wonderful entries intraday.  My thesis/outlook remains unchanged and I hope the outcome follows suit:

* $BA CALL 03/20 $130 (1...gimme dat bailout fed)
* $APRN PUT 03/20 $5 (2)
* $PTON PUT 4/17 $17 (5)
* $MCD CALL 4/17 $200 (2...Trump drive thru pump/tendies for tendies)
* $WEN CALL 4/17 $15 (2)
* $SPY PUT 4/17 $150 (10)
* $VXX PUT 4/17 $25 (10)
* $SPY PUT 5/15 $175 (5)
* $GLD CALL 6/19 $180 (2), $200 (2)
* $HYG PUT 9/18 $75 (2)

I wanted to share because although my conviction is as strong as ever that the downside shall continue, it's important to consider that this Friday close is a triple witching hour (was initially quadruple until yesterday's announcement).  With volatility and open interest at such wild levels don't be surprised if we finally see a shakeout bounce in advance of 4/1 expiration.  I currently have it as a <50% chance but with the Fed leveraging their full computing power to print fresh repo it must be considered.  Fear not, if this does play out Friday's close will be one of the greatest short entries you'll experience since Donald Trump Jr. recommended buying fresh stonks in your 401ks at the end of February.  Stay safe old friends and may the tendies be with you all.

**edit: to clarify these are existing positions**

2020-03-18 03:28:13,zg44,25,"Today's trading was the type of day that you want to see as you get closer to the bottom.

For one of the first times on a big up day, instead of everything moving up together by similar percentages, we saw quality stocks substantially outperform coronavirus affected stocks (Boeing, cruise, airlines etc.).

On these types of up days the past week, we often saw the coronavirus affected stocks get a big bump too, but there wasn't much of that today.  Investors/algs were a lot more picky today.

I do think we're approaching A bottom over the next 2 weeks; VIX is basically as high as it can reasonably go, and we've bounced near the Dec. 2018 lows.  I think we'll see a lot more stabilization if we see a big stimulus package from Congress, since that would boost sentiment substantially.

The question of whether this would be THE bottom depends on the next 2 months, if coronavirus really escalates out of control in the US and we end up in a longer than expected quagmire, then yeah we could see another big selloff and retest of the first upcoming bottom.  I think we see a lot of sideways movement until we get to the other side of the parabolic growth curve of the virus.  That's probably when we see more of a final push out of this bear market, but even then it's tough to see anything like a straight line back up to S&P 3400 any time in the next 12 months.  There's a ton of issues to work through in the global economy."

From the Imperial College of London's COVID-19 report:
Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over. In the most effective mitigation strategy examined, which leads to a single, relatively short epidemic (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), the surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least 8-fold under the more optimistic scenario for critical care requirements that we examined. In addition, even if all patients were able to be treated, we predict there would still be in the order of 250,000 deaths in GB, and 1.1-1.2 million in the US."

2020-03-18 01:39:53,LehmanParty,1,"So let's say there's no agreement for a while. Oil demand will be very little for a full quarter, maybe two. So how about oil production? Every country has to either produce and subsidize the industry or basically give up, and most nations' social or strategic mandates won't allow them to do that, but at the same time people won't sell oil for say, $20/bbl, so there will be some sort of a floor and the price will stay there until demand and production stabilize once again. Oil will be cheap and plentiful and when the dust settles, companies will be loaded up with debt and the previously cheap barrels will be a little dusty but otherwise unscathed. May as well long oil itself which won't financially decay instead of the companies with operating expenses and financial obligations. The commodity stock will only cost the warehousing/ETF fees and whatever interest/capital holdup you accumulate while waiting. EDIT: ITM USO calls perhaps for a leveraged play with little decay or mini/full strength futures."

We are following up on yesterday‚Äôs notice about the Costco Travel employee who passed away at home Sunday night. We received confirmation this afternoon that the employee tested positive for COVID-19. In the interests of privacy, we are not disclosing the employee‚Äôs name here.    

We understand this news causes a great deal of concern and anxiety among employees, particularly those at Costco Travel. 

Yesterday and last night, we took the precaution of bringing in a professional cleaning crew to perform a thorough cleaning and sanitation of the Costco Travel building (LP-2). Following the cleaning, the building reopened today. Additional sanitation will continue daily.

Health officials generally advise that people who have not been in close contact with a sick person are at low risk for COVID-19 infection. If you are feeling sick or even concerned, however, please stay home, monitor your health and symptoms, and contact your health care provider. You may also contact Teladoc at 1-800-Teladoc (1-800-835-2362), or the Aetna 24-Hour Informed Health Line at 1-800- 556-1555.

2020-03-18 00:19:22,Randomness898,5,"If the Fed or SEC really wanted to reduce volatility they would ban futures trading for ES and VIX. Said this same statement when we were limit up yesterday for no reason so not biased against the direction. Biggest issue is it hurts the retail and institutional investors who can't trade it so every day we start like -5% or +5% for no reason. It's cause a lot of market makers use the futures to hedge their delta and vol risk so when someone sells these guys gotta follow in the same direction to hedge (and vice versa on buys), accelerating the up and down moves by like 3x. That's why if we start pretty range bound tomrorow it's a good sign for the market, just a bad sign for people here who are only long calls or puts.

The reason this happens more now than before is because market makers are short options (short gamma) from their old short downside puts they sold a long time ago so when they are short gamma they have to hedge aggressively in both directions. Before when they were neutral gamma when market was just going up, they didn't have to do much hedging so futures barely moved.

This works in reverse too. Even though we are down now technically if there are lots of buyers, this thing can easily accelerate up since the market makers now have to start buying too. Of course we can sell off very fast too. Basically there's a reason for vix being so high. 

-this is cause some people below were asking about futures."

Not to mention if other countries start seeing death tolls around 4% like Italy is currently experiencing.

They are up ~200-250 with the recent drops.  I guess someone is hedging even harder with all the volatility. The options price is small but the gains so great that I'm wondering if I can just keep rolling these as long as volatility is high. What's the risk?

2020-03-17 23:05:29,Kamanar,6,"COVID, Stimulus, and Oil

So we've seen the Fed and Government in the past week or so dump an absolute monster amount of funding into the market (and possibly the economy).  To the tune of a sizable fraction of our GDP from last year.

What does that stimulus mean to us as individuals?

Well, so far, not much.  We might all get thousand dollar checks (you'll all dump it into Puts within seconds, yeah I know), but who knows what else is going to happen.  Quite possibly major job loss, maybe lots of free sick leave for COVID, who knows.  But between repo markets and the upcoming stimulus package, that's at least 3 trillion dollars that's been dumped into the markets.  A quick google gives us a US population of 327 million people.  If they'd just given it to every man, woman, and child in the country, we'd each be getting around a 9,000 dollar check, or we could have had nine months of UBI.  Betcha that would have helped more than propping up the stock market.

But you said Oil earlier.  What's that about?

The US dollar is the reserve currency of the world.  Why?  Our economy is generally the 'strongest,' so our debt is considered to be always valid.  Which is why we've got one of the last bond rates in the positives.  (Beware falling bonds again...)  The other leg of the dollar being the reserve currency is because of oil, specifically petrodollars.  Oil, one of the most necessary commodities on the market, is traded in dollars.  Because, again, we are the safe haven.  Food for thought.  If OPEC and Russia hadn't gotten into a tiff and dropped the price of oil, how much faster would we have moved to renewables?  And if oil became less of 'THE' commodity and no longer necessary for vehicles and power generation, how well would we stand up as the reserve currency if it was solely on the strength of our economy?

The stimulus is basically funded through an absurd amount of debt.  Because we most certainly don't have 3+ trillion dollars lying around, unless we print it.

What's all this mean?  Fuck all if I know, but we're in for some seriously weird times ahead."

TLDR: *Multiple air traffic controllers tested positive for coronavirus.  Another tower is taking over for now, but operations will be reduced until the tower can re-open.*

The Chicago tower is in charge of ground control, takeoffs, and landings.  Without the tower in operation, the nearby TRACON tower, which normally only handles planes after they've taken off or before they get within Chicago's airspace, will be handling the takeoff and landing operations.  However, because they now have to take on multiple roles, they won't be able to land and take off as many airplanes, which means operations will be reduced.

If the TRACON tower also goes down, there's a very good chance that Chicago airport would have to close.

[https://i.imgur.com/me6MYX6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/me6MYX6.jpg)

What you're looking at is the four-hour chart, and these are the following to look at:

1. Since March 4, we've been following along a trendline that has been a tough resistance. Over the weekend, even with the Fed cut being announced, we still were not able to break through it. It is the red line going from the top to the bottom at a diagonal.
2. The green squares represent all the times we've hit off the trendline spoken above.
3. The red square at the current date represents the 2500 resistance that we've been dealing with for the last 2 trading days. Even though we keep breaking above it, we have yet to close above it.  6 attempts at it, failing each time.
4. Pay attention to where my cursor is, it's towards the middle of the red box. It's marking where the 4-hour bar would be between 6 AM to 10 AM tomorrow. If we retest today's highs tomorrow morning, we'll not only be testing today's highs, but we'll also face the trendline resistance.

Recap: We are setting up for a drop from here. Expect to see the bottom retested again tomorrow (2350), and then us breaking down to 2018 lows this week.

Edit: Forgot to mention, I do have a short /ES position @ 2460.67 average.

Edit: [For anyone that wants a link to the chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/jD5dTNWM/).

Last edit: [Hopped out of the trade at the market open](https://imgur.com/8kOGDZu). We are still respecting the 2350 zone hardcore."

5) sell half when you hit 100% profit. 
6) sell other half whenever you feel. It‚Äôs all profit.

My prediction is the Stonk Market only goes up today (and maybe tomorrow) but it will fall hard in the long run due to the increased number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the United States.

One of the few hypothetical events that could happen is the complete lockdown of New York City like San Francisco, the possibility of negative interests, shutdown domestic air flights, and the likelihood of more states deciding to go into full-lockdown mode to control the spread of ‚ÄúCoronaVirus‚Äù. Given the same timeline as Italy, the U.S. numbers will increase exponentially between today and April.

Norway‚Äôs Unemployment Jumps 128% in only one week, making the unemployment rate in this country highest since 1995. The spread of the coronavirus have brought the richest Nordic economy to a near standstill. That alone can give us somewhat of an idea how the rest of Europe is struggling, on top of the major debts they're sitting on at the moment. Don't wanna be a neg, but we are probably just at the tip of a domino fall that this black swan has brought us, and once shit hits the fan, things are going south. Real south.

I don't think a lot of us have yet to understand the full devastation that the novel virus plus the wildly hyper-elated economic period in the past few years are going to have on our daily life. Fed is on full on panic mode, and our interest rate is at 0%, yet there's virtually no way in calming the market. Casinos, hotels and airlines are begging to be bailed out, trillions of government debt, etc. Most businesses who have been living paycheck by paycheck, are in danger with the amounting cash problems, huge costs, while generating virtually no revenues. On top of that, there is a looming liquidity trap

2020-03-17 21:12:42,bizmanon,38,"I have a feeling that the ""rug pull"" we've heard about will occur next week. I'm going to attempt to explain my reasoning for this belief.

Friday 3/20 is triple witching (weekly, monthly options and futures contracts all expire on the same day) for stock market meaning market makers need to prop market to [max pain](https://imgur.com/a/yWqPw8j) or else they lose money.

Many conspiracy theorists, astrologists, and numerologists are pointing toward 3/22 as a very important day in the history of earth. I've included a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fi4gnl/coronavirus_tom_hanks_322_skull_and_bones_border/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from...r/conspiracy (not all conspiracy theories are crazy fyi). This one post opened my eyes to this possibility, but a lot of other ‚Äútruther‚Äù media I‚Äôve been chasing has been pointing the same direction. Worst news of all time might be dropped on Sunday. Monday will be full on max panic in the public, and thus the market...if it's not already shut down.

To add to the rug pull, I'd expect to see some indications that the market is ready to turn around. I wouldn't be surprised to see for example 2 green days in a row (Thurs, Fri), or maybe we even go green tomorrow (doubtful and if so it will be minimal) and make it 4 in a row. We have heard about just how long a dick the fed is willing to swing, but the one piece of ammo in the gubmt pocket is a ‚Äúcure‚Äù so don‚Äôt be surprised to see news getting more optimistic about that. We may even hear about [everyone‚Äôs favorite investor making a giant move this week](https://imgur.com/gallery/ghq8LYy) triggering a herd of normie followers over the cliff.

What should you do about it? I believe that IV will peak next week. Meaning buying anything long dated at that point will be a losing decision. Buy your puts on Friday near closing bell. There will be a giant rip, 3x the size of the previous Fridays we've witnessed if not more. If you are ballsy and jive with my thesis here, buying calls tomorrow or Thursday, even Friday morning might be good money to build capital.

Make sure to close a comfortable amount of puts on Monday, then continue closing a percentage of them each red day until you are left with only a few long dated puts. Again, IV will eventually crush even if market continues to go down. It can't maintain this downward speed. Remember that.

Dip into a few LEAP calls Monday. And continue this every red day. Go as far dated as you can, but don't over leverage. Keep cash too. Leaps might be more profitable if bought during the boring sideways depression timeline which will start after the free fall finally ends. I‚Äôm not experienced enough to know this part.

This is all fitting together in my mind, but I need to make sure you all don‚Äôt blindly follow this advice. This is what I will be doing, but it could be very wrong for all I know.

Or I dunno it expires worthless.

2020-03-17 21:08:22,SlothRogen,20,"Here's the usual daily recap of Trump's briefing:


* ‚ÄúNY has uh‚Ä¶. A pretty big problem‚Ä¶ I guess we would say the number one hot spot‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also getting FEMA very much involved‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve been involved‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre getting them involved‚Äù
* ‚ÄúOne day we‚Äôre going to stand up her and we‚Äôre going to say, that‚Äôs it, we won.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúAs you know, I met with the department store people‚Ä¶ great meeting.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre stocking up like never before. We‚Äôre trying to get people to buy less. Buy less.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be big and it‚Äôs gonna be bold. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever seen anything like it.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIt has already provided stability‚Äù
* Mnuchin: ‚ÄúAmericans need cash now. The president has said to give them cash now.‚Äù
* Mnuchin: ‚ÄúAs you know, this is worse than 9/11‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWe wanna go big or solid. The country is very strong. We‚Äôve never been so strong.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWith this invisible enemy, we don‚Äôt want airlines going out of business. So we‚Äôre going big, and that‚Äôs the way everybody seems to like it.‚Äù
* Mnuchin: ‚ÄúWe absolutely believe in keeping the markets open.‚Äù
* Trump: ‚ÄúWe wanna have very‚Ä¶ as few deaths as possible.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once we‚Äôve done, I think it‚Äôs gonna pop back. We gonna pop back like no ones ever seen before.‚Äù (about the market)
* ‚ÄúThat was totally misrepresented by the New York Times, unfortunately.‚Äù
* Reporter: ‚ÄúIs that just a reporting issue (the low cases)?‚Äù Trump: ‚ÄúWell, I just saw WV is the only one that has no cases. So obviously that‚Äôs being treated differently than NY or California.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúVery robust healthcare system""
* Reporter: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been telling us for days now that millions of tests have been sent out, so why have only 8000 been tested?‚Äù Doc: ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to se those numbers change‚Ä¶ we can only make them available. Groups have to order them.‚Äù
* Trump: ‚ÄúI would just say, enjoy your home. Stay.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI would put us in the category of doing very well, for a country so big‚Ä¶ I would recommend they uh, just enjoy they‚Äôre living room.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWe have to get rid of this. We have to win this war. And quickly‚Ä¶ because the longer it takes‚Ä¶ very bad situation.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWe had such incredible‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost like a spirit. Spirit is the word. The banks are coming in. They‚Äôre having extensions.‚Äù
* Trump: ‚ÄúYou know me‚Ä¶ for a long time. I‚Äôve been talking about this for many years. We have to take care of our country. That was one of the many things‚Ä¶ on the list.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWell China, was uh, putting out information that was false. That our military gave this to them‚Ä¶. Our military didn‚Äôt give it to anyone.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEverything was really hunky-dory. And then one day we hear about this rumor‚Ä¶ and all of a sudden we make a decision to close it up early‚Ä¶. We make good decisions.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe people behind me are total pros‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs Anthony? He‚Äôs become a major television star.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody better than what we have.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs gonna be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.‚Äù
* ""We think of everything. We have every idea that you've mentioned.""
* ""The only thing we haven't done well is to get good press.""
