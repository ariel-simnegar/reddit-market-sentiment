* Uber call was terrible. They lost 3B in one quarter, they need to raise cash soon. Numbers are terrible. Layoffs, demand drop, Uber Eats numbers are still very small. Eats makes 4MM of revenue world wide with terrible margins. Report compares to same period of 2019 to ""soften the shock"". Uber does not worth half in normal times, let alone now. Some competitor will do the same without debt post crisis. Stock is up 18%.

Tickets for Monday, May 11, the first day the park will welcome guests again, through May 14 were no longer available on the park's online booking service.  


They also sold out for the weekend dates of May 16 and 17.

-CSOD dropped from $55 to $42 after Q4 earnings beating EPS 0.43 vs 0.34 expected.  

-Revenue was also beat 149.59 vs 146.24 expected.  

-The drop was largely concerns around operational efficiency and achieving rule of 40.  

-Since then CSOD spent 1.29 billion to acquire a competitor which should add another 50-80 million per quarter to revenue.  

-CSOD has a ton of free cash flow.  

-The X factor is the additional 3000+ clients that CSOD can upsell their wares to.  

-If you‚Äôre bullish then $55 is attainable since long term outlook is promising. If you‚Äôre bearish, then the current range of $30 - $35 is plausible.  

-Either way this STONK is way too cheap at current valuation and has room to run to resistance of $40-42.

Can I buy long term calls that are like, for example, an year out, and just sell it whenever I want, if I want to take profit? F For example, let's say I buy 25 x 100 contracts of Jan 2021 MSFT calls, which equate to roughly $102,000. According to the calculator, even if Microsoft reaches $189 anytime by this month or next month, I'll be making at least $20,000 in profit. So can I just sell it then and walk away?

$99c is trading for $3

$101c is trading for $2 .50

$102c is trading for $2

If x goes up 5% tomorrow, you will make a min of $6 for the 99c (100% gain) 

$4 on the 101c (60% gain) 

$3 on the 102c (50% gain) 

Just because the option is further otm and hits, does not mean it will always pay out a higher %. Especially right now when the market is still pretty volatile, I see options priced like this consistently.  In order for the 102c to payout a higher % than the 99c, stock x would have to have a 8%+ day."

Debt restructuring
Business operation expansion
Cost of operation reduction

They work with Amazon, but I they are a sma leg in the Amazon chain, and likewise Amazon i believe is a small portion of their income.

Most people are using the unemployment just to survive and can‚Äôt save it for later. Then you know damn well there‚Äôs going to be the people who could have saved but they thought they got free rent for 3 months so they spent their unemployment on a brand new 60 inch 4k hdr TV instead of saving the money and they‚Äôll be *shocked* when they found out they still owe money. Hell even if people went back to work, everyone knows the stat that 40% of Americans would be bankrupt by an unexpected $400 expense. You think people are going to be able to pay three months rent with non-existent savings after not working for 3 months? Then how do landlords pay the sum of their forbearance payments when tenants can‚Äôt pay 3 months of rent?

Shits fucked. We just don‚Äôt see it yet. The stimulus didn‚Äôt solve any problems it just pushed them off until later. The market will continue upies until the last possible second so hedge funds can squeeze every last penny of profit before everything falls apart. We could easily have another 2-3 months of green before then though. That‚Äôs about how long foreclosures and evictions have been blocked by various state and federal laws.

The drop was largely concerns around operational efficiency and achieving rule of 40. Since then CSOD spent 1.29 billion to acquire a competitor which should add another 50-80 million per quarter to revenue. The X factor is the additional 3000+ clients that CSOD can upsell their wares to. If you‚Äôre bullish then $55 is attainable since long term outlook is promising. If you‚Äôre bearish, then the current range of $30 - $35 is plausible. Either way this STONK is way too cheap at current valuation and has room to run to resistance of $40-42.

Since capital is finite, and there isn't an efficient way to drive down the price of a stock compared to drive up the price, it seems reasonable to assume that the price of a stock isn't priced based on average investor sentiment, but based on the sentiment of it's most loyal defenders.

It's like a fantasy football auction, or any auction for that matter. You only need two people to bid up the price. The two Pats fans are going to drive up the price of Brady, just like two Tesla fans are going to drive up the price of Tesla.

2020-05-08 02:35:36,ButtFart88,10,"My rules if anyone is interested, these have served me very well in minimizing the things that cause losses

1) never ever short a meme stock. Just don‚Äôt play it if you‚Äôre concerned. 99% of the time it will defy all logic and keep going up

2) never intra-day trade. There are 2 opportunities to buy stocks. First 15 minutes, and last 15 minutes. Buy in the last 15 minutes to position yourself for pre-market. Buy in the first 15 minutes to position yourself for the trading day.

3) tied to rule 2, but once you‚Äôve officially noticed a stock had gone on a run is when the run is over. If you‚Äôre hell bent on intra-day trading, wait for a dip. Same goes with shorting. Once you‚Äôve noticed a stock has fallen a significant amount, it‚Äôs about to rebound. 

4) don‚Äôt try to outsmart the market. Together apes strong. 90% of the time the market is right in how they‚Äôre reacting. If they‚Äôre all selling a stock and you think ‚Äúwhat idiots this stock is great‚Äù you‚Äôre probably gonna get burned. Same with them buying. This doesn‚Äôt apply to small dips, and you should definitely work on catching falling knives, but stocks with serious upward or downward momentum like Tesla or Oil are stocks that you should not try to outsmart the market on."

* Step 2: Wait until Wednesday ER for the pump

You can basically buy 200 contracts (20,000 shares) for $1,000. If CSCO stock goes up from $41.60 to $45.00 by 5/13, the estimated return would be $3,600.

At the moment it has IV of about 45-50% but like most stocks the IV will increase as earnings get closer. Let‚Äôs say I buy a $120c expiring 5/22 for stock X and earnings are on 5/20 considering IV increases will my whole position value be worth more if the IV increases? So what I mean is this scenario. let‚Äôs say there wasn‚Äôt earnings and on stock X and on 5/19 the share price is $110 and IV is steady at around the same 50ish% and I have X profit. Now let‚Äôs say there are earnings on 5/20 for the same stick X all bought at the same time with same infusion IV and IV spiked will my profit be more at the same share price ($110) if IV is at 105% on the same date 5/19?

Square- 74 calls 5/15

Bkng - 1500 calls 5/15

Zillow 55 calls 5/15

Appn <‚Äî rip

True - 3 calls 5/15

Csod 75 calls 5/22

Seas 15 call 5/15


Zillow, rpd, and true beat earnings, so will probably hold those with a stop loss tomorrow

Not  sure if this means go full bull because the market is unstoppable or a reason for worry but..

Since March 23 when SPY closed at 222.95 to today's close 287.68 SPY went up at total of 64.73  points but 39.84 points off that came after hours with little to no volume. After hours meaning the change in SPY from prior night's closing price to next day's Open price.

Only 24.89 points of the climb happened when the market was open.

So 62% of the move from the bottom till now came during after hours.

Unemployment measures the number of people who don't have jobs but who are searching for one. Labor force participation is the proportion of non-imprisoned citizens who are working to those who are not. If the job market is so shit people give up looking for jobs unemployment can actually go down. No clue whether or not that's bullish or bearish given the last 6 weekly unemployment claims numbers but we all know the bots will pump on it overnight.

I just wanted to state a revelation I had today, that may help some of you in your uncertainties with the market (mine is simply impatience). I‚Äôm not a technical analyzer, but I took a good look at prior crashes (.com crash and 08 crash, also market flux in 2016) in all of the crashes, there were fast recovery points that lasted for up to over a month. But eventually economic situations finally overcame the desire for bull profit and the market dropped, usually more than it did the first time. I think we are looking at that type of near future, but I‚Äôm going to switch my 1 month short positions for much longer durations. I feel a little more relaxed after looking at the graphs, I recommend you try it yourself."
