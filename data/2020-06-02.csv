>These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged."

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, (previous thread) and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

People from all walks of Simpson Nation have banded together to fight a common enemy: lack of understanding about Simpson. People wonder, ‚ÄúThe show I‚Äôve treasured, known and love, for years and years, is not what it seems to be... not after this new information has come to light..‚Äù

People are righteously angry. They want the truth. Some have even gone as far as to inflict violence on others, as Nelson has done to Milhouse, on numerous occasions throughout the show. Some people, convinced certain buildings contain clues to the mystery of Simpson, have begun breaking into these places and destroying them if they lack evidence.

While I do not condone riots and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can‚Äôt even keep count. 
EXAMPLE
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0OVfjn-lrsk


I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.
