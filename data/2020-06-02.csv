>These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged."

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, (previous thread) and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

People from all walks of Simpson Nation have banded together to fight a common enemy: lack of understanding about Simpson. People wonder, ‚ÄúThe show I‚Äôve treasured, known and love, for years and years, is not what it seems to be... not after this new information has come to light..‚Äù

People are righteously angry. They want the truth. Some have even gone as far as to inflict violence on others, as Nelson has done to Milhouse, on numerous occasions throughout the show. Some people, convinced certain buildings contain clues to the mystery of Simpson, have begun breaking into these places and destroying them if they lack evidence.

While I do not condone riots and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can‚Äôt even keep count. 
EXAMPLE
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0OVfjn-lrsk


I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.

Everything is priced in.

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born.

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether a civil war has been priced in all the deaths or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

2020-06-03 08:18:54,scopolamine,4,"CLOs will make the markets illiquid by end of summer! Expecting a market crash. Time for CLOs!

CLOs are securities backed by loans, each with a different tranch. Tranches are ranked by quality of loan: investment grade, unrated and speculative. Once the loans are packaged, CLOs get another rating, based on specific terms.

Banks, insurance companies & hedge funds are holding CLOs currently. CLOs are created based on debt from companies with less than perfect credit: airlines, hotels, restaurants and entertainments are currently the most troubled CLOs.

Moody‚Äôs downgraded 20% of the underlying loans in the CLOs at the end of April, & put $44 billion additional on watch for further downgrade. This could end up downgrading the CLOs, which in turn could grade them as junk (40% are currently investment grade)

Fitch ratings anticipates $80 billion (15% of the CLO market) to default. To compare, in 2009 they stated $78 billion would fail. 14% of these CLOs are due by the end of the year, with a total 35% due by 2021.

TLDR: Here's how the crash will happen: companies go bankrupt > lenders will be unpaid due to poorly-written covenants > loans in the CLOs begin to downgrade > CLOs get rated junk > $1.4T market becomes illiquid."

J.C. Penney Co. had 846 stores when it filed for bankruptcy on May 15 of this year. It said it plans to permanently close 242 of those stores.

J. Crew, filed bankruptcy on May 4. It has been slowly closing stores since 2018. Due to its debt burden, analysts say it could be forced to close as many as half of its stores.

Neiman Marcus, which filed for bankruptcy protection on May 7, had announced ¬†in March that it would close most of its off-price Last Call stores by early 2021.

Telecommunications company, Frontier Communications Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection on April 15. It had $17.5 billion in debt.

With almost $19 billion of debt, the century-old Hertz rental car company filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday, May 22. In addition to Hertz, it operates Dollar and Thrifty car rentals.

Bankruptcies this year in the energy sector are almost as severe as with retailers. One of the largest was Whiting Petroleum, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 1. It has reported a net loss in four of the past five years."

I hope you all understand as do I after that pump eod that we are going to all time highs again. We will get there, and it won‚Äôt take long. 

It may seem too good to be true, but this is a unique time that we are in. Money is simply being funneled into stock assets as it has become clear that is the best place for it to be. 

A lot of people are learning that the market is not necessarily a reflection of the current or forward-looking state of the economy, but a tool to make money. 

More retail investors than ever. No the big dawgs aren‚Äôt out to try to fuck everyone over at max pain. Yes the market will continue to fluctuate but is heading for ATH‚Äôs in due time. 

I‚Äôve lost a lot of money and will continue to try to play ranges, but without a doubt the best use of my money in the interest of time and stress is parking it in some July dated spy calls.

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

While I do not condone rioting and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can‚Äôt even keep count. Simpson knows rioting is not only a good storyline, it‚Äôs a great way to get people to listen to you.

I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.

Let‚Äôs make a change in Simpson.....

""A bubble stars when any group of stocks, in this case those associated with the excitement of the Internet, begin to rise. The updraft encourages more people to buy the stocks, which causes more TV and print coverage, which causes even more people to buy, which creates big profits for early Internet stockholders. The successful investors tell you how easy it is to get rich, which causes the stocks to rise further, which pulls in larger and larger groups of investors.""

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

While I do not condone rioting and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can‚Äôt even keep count. Simpson knows rioting is not only a good storyline, it‚Äôs a great way to get people to listen to you.

I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.

Let‚Äôs make a change in Simpson.....

&#x200B;

* The      Nikkei reports new coronavirus cases in Tokyo reached 34 on Tuesday, a day      after schools, shopping malls and gyms were allowed to reopen, prompting      the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to issue its first alert under a new      warning system. While the alert does not immediately reverse the recent      easing of restrictions on businesses and public activity, it does call on      Tokyoites to avoid unnecessary trips outdoors as a preventive measure. 
* The      story notes that if the number of infections rises after an alert is      issued and if new daily cases average more than 50 during the most recent      week, the metro government will again ask restaurants and retailers to      close or shorten their opening hours. Such a request will also be made if      the transmission route is unknown in 50% of new cases or if the number of      weekly confirmed cases doubles.

It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to sell as you‚Äôd just create a taxable event for no reason unless you were at a loss but I mean most people probably aren‚Äôt as we‚Äôre nearing the highs again.

The problem with puts is that you must time them perfectly and get out nearly perfectly. TVIX doesn't have those issues and if it goes down you average down. The Tqqq gives you the upside with this nutty market and if things turn south sell covered calls on the tqqq, sell the tvix and buy Tqqq.

We will not vanish without a fight!

2020-06-02 22:38:05,Sheev_Palpatine69,7,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Federal Reserve. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical economics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also JPow's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Keynesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Federal Reserve truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in JPow's existencial catchphrase ""Money Printer Goes Brrrr,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to 4Chan's epic Wojak. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Donald Trump's genius unfolds itself on their telephones. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ 

And yes by the way, I DO have a Federal Reserve tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

So does that mean theta will rise by nearly 7 if IV drops from 177 to around 80? Which all culminates in expected theta at open of like 9?  Delta is currently .37 so 9/.37 is 24 dollar needed drop.

If I'm wrong can someone help me understand why?"

Please feel free to let me know if I have forgotten anything:


Find yourself reading through the comments thinking ""what the fuck are these idiots actually trying to say?"" 

## WSB Vocab rubric

algos = I don't understand whats happening

MM = I lost but wont admit its my fault

flag = Price stopped moving in the direction I want, but it'll keep going in that direction

printers = people buying

retail = everyone dumb but me

bulls = i only buy calls like an idiot

bears = i only buy puts like an idiot

manipulated = someone with more money moved the price in the direction I don't want

moon = im zoomed in on the 1m chart and it went up .3 percent

dump = im zoomed in on the 1m chart and it went down .3 percent

fake market = market is moving in the direction i dont like because of a conspiracy to fix the market

ban = your post actually made me doubt my position

this = your post confirmed my confirmation bias

is anyone else playing... = i saw a ticker in another post but still need someone to spoon feed me a trade

do X, they said, it can't go tits up, they said = i decided that the best way to spend my money was to follow advice on a subreddit famous for it's massive losses

resistance = the 1m candle stopped moving up for a second

support = the 1m candle stopped moving down for a second

volatility is high = volatility is up 5% from yesterday

ppt = futures are up and i don't know why

futures dont matter = futures are moving in a direction i dont like 

pajama traders = i don't know who is buying in futures, a market i've only ever watched. 

X are fucked = futures opened in the direction i like, so that means it'll go 5% in that direction.

CNBC = cartoon network"

The games are manipulated, they are unfair, and the prizes aren't very often worth the reward. 

I guess it's fun to have the thrill of overcoming insurmountable odds though.  It's cool that everyone sees when you're the guy that actually won, and no one really treats you different when you lose. 

When you're done giving ""those crazy unfair carnies"" your money, you have a great story to tell your buddies at the bar.

2020-06-02 20:33:16,PrestigeWWinc,1,"Lyft sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA loss 'not to exceed' $325M In a regulatory filing, Lyft said: ""Given the stronger performance in May 2020 versus April 2020, the company expects that its Adjusted EBITDA loss for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 will not exceed $325 million if average daily rideshare ride volume in June 2020 is unchanged versus May 2020 levels. This expectation represents an approximate 10% improvement relative to the company's prior expectation that its second quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss would not exceed $360 million based on April 2020 ride trends. In addition to cost reduction actions that management described on Lyft's first quarter earnings call on May 6, 2020, the Company has taken further steps to improve its financial position. Specifically, in May, Lyft completed a convertible debt offering, along with corresponding capped call transactions that resulted in an effective conversion price of $73.83 for the senior unsecured notes. On a pro forma basis for these transactions, Lyft held approximately $3.3 billion of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2020. Lyft expects to release financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 in early August.""
