I run my own Shopify store and what I learned is that Shopify is your ONLY option. Wix and everything else is a complete joke. They're also setting up their own distribution network so I don't have to fulfill orders out of my garage anymore, and that is going to be massive for them.

Are they overvalued? Probably. But they have zero competition in this space, why do you think Facebook partnered with them (and others)? Don't you think they would have done this themselves if they could?

I pay out of my ass for their monthly fees, plus they get a % for every sale I make, now multiple that by (allegedly) 1 million stores. It's a money making machine.

With 25% of people unemployed and fairly widespread business failures over the coming months, there is going to be a significant reduction in consumers. As such, the only way that we can justify being at Feb 2020 valuations is if all the remaining consumers buy enough to make up for the ones who are no longer buying.

If 25% of people are unemployed, are the remaining 75% going to go on 33% more trips? Buy 33% more cars? Will they take on 33% more NFLX subscriptions, or increase their ACS usage by 33%?

It doesn't matter what your product is. If you lost 25% of your customers (B2B or B2C), and the remaining 75% don't pick up the slack, you're kind of fucked.

The current market is overvalued, and I am betting that within 3 months, we'll see that many of these job losses and business closures are **permanent**. At that time, the writing will be on the wall for even the most greed-blinded bull.

Check out the differences in closing NAV vs any S&P500 ETF (SPY, VOO, IWM) closing price. 

The difference is around 1.5%. For SPY specifically, the closing price is 299.08 and the closing NAV is 295.46 (from Schwab). 

There is a similar gap on SPY, VOO, And IVV. Interestingly, I‚Äôm seeing something similar on IWM but not on QQQ. Spot checking a few sector ETFs: XLK (tech) has no gap, but XLF (finance) and XLY (cons desc) do. 

Does this mean anything? My hypothesis is that these ETF are deviating from their underlying for non-tech stocks. And given this difference will be arbitraged away SPY should move closer to NAV (the ETF market caps are around 200B or so for SPY compared to ~2T for the sum of market caps for all 500 of the underlying).

* Is this all a ploy to get retail to put in their dollars at even higher highs? Unlikely, as the size of the retail market is dwarfed by the professionals. Why would you burn billions to make millions?
* Is this because of clandestine chest-thumping by Donald Trump? Probably not, as this amount of money would have to come with congressional approval, which is a public process, and we haven't seen anything like this.
* Is this rally to essentially ATH (for QQQ) because of a bonafide increase in the value of the underlying? Hard to argue that this much value has been created in the past 3 months, with the entire globe being at some stage of shutdown.

Who is doing the buying here, and what on earth could they possibly be working towards?"

Very interested when all 50 states comes in and we can look at it at a whole. Looks like we‚Äôre gonna break through the latest valley and we might be out of the woods of Covid soon. 

Free states, as always, are out performing or performing on par with lock down states, meaning opening or shit-giving has zero effect on new cases. Which is also very bullish as it means they‚Äôll be no second wave and we can continue the process of opening."

We are easily going to melt up to 320+ soon. There‚Äôs literally nothing that can stop it since it‚Äôll get pumped up in low volume and the dump in high volume won‚Äôt move it down as much as the pump due to retail buying. 

Bears I‚Äôm sorry but nothing‚Äôs gonna stop it. It‚Äôs not fundamentals. It‚Äôs just how the market works. Remember we would have been at 360+ if it wasn‚Äôt for the virus at this point and probably 380 EOY if the virus didn‚Äôt mess it up short term.

It‚Äôs possible it will happen tomorrow. Be watching for when Covid cases update tonight. If it drops even further we‚Äôre officially past the stagnation phase and into exponential decrease phase.

Basically the way a flu works is exponential increase, stagnation, then exponential decrease, normally leaving entirely by June 1st. This is following a very similar pattern. Things already look positive, but if deaths go down again tonight tomorrow will be a face ripping rally."

I think the slow bleed up after hours are internationals and institutional investors scooping up deals because they know the US Fed has explicitly expressed that they'll take losses on buying junk debt. Imagine controlling hundreds of billions of dollars and the Fed has just told you that they're already prepared to take trillions in losses to sustain liquidity. Idk about you but as an American, I'd be content getting rich off at the expense of US national debt. It's a fucking accounting drill for the Fed literally doesn't matter. In the short term I think we continue to see lower volume, especially in light of little new news coming out of companies and participants that went to cash in March and April are too shy to buy back in. And lower volume will likely imply more green. Short term at least."

>And finally, around the middle of April, we experienced a rapid increase in traffic and sales in our stores and a broad surge in sales of more discretionary categories, including apparel, which persisted throughout the end of the month. The surge in stores occurred while our **digital growth continued at unprecedented rates of 200% to 300% above last year**. As a result, over the last couple of weeks of April, we saw some of the strongest comparable sales growth we've experienced in our history. When you put all these chapters together and look at the first quarter in total, our comparable sales grew nearly 11% with a wide range of performance across categories as guests changed their shopping pattern in response to the crisis.

&#x200B;

>From a channel perspective, first quarter store sales grew about 1% **while digital comp sales increased by 141%**. Of course, these quarterly numbers mask how quickly trends changed within the quarter. Specifically, we began the quarter with a relatively normal February, in which we saw overall comp growth of 3.8% and digital comp growth of 33%, and ended in April which saw **total company comp growth of more than 16% and a jaw-dropping 282% increase in digital comp sales**.

TGT since that: -7.3%
