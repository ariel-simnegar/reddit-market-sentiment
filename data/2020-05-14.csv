After he let trump down he went into self imposed exile. Still, each morning he immediately checked his phone for a message from the president. He was relieved when there was nothing, but a part of him was a little disappointed too. He yearned to create money. To print it with reckless abandon. The printer called to him. In his mind he could hear it. Calling his name, whispering in his ear, like a  provocative lover. Something vibrated on his night stand and startled him. He had a new message."

With rona, 90,000 Americans have died, and we all just talk about the curve and social distancing and the politicians just go on TV and talk matter-of-factly about the economy and shit. There's no virtue signaling on social media, it's just people bitching about going back to work and shit.

I‚Äôve only made one other suggestion on WSB... that was SE...26 days ago when SE closed at $51.98...today they closed $61.59. See below....


‚Äî‚ÄîThis is me extending a courteous notice for those that keep playing the SPY and getting burned. 

It‚Äôs a Singapore company dedicated to digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital financial services...based out of Singapore. A country that is serious about COVID-19.   

It‚Äôs at 52-week high for a reason. It was heading this way prior to COVID. COVID barely slowed it down. 

It anything it made it stronger. Not only, a perfect COVID play but a long play. 

It has a price range of 54-62...with target of $57...unlike others that have a gap between low and high price ends. This makes me more confident. Plus it‚Äôs being talked about by internet stock analyst, podcasts, Motley...people trust in Motley. Like it or not. 

How is it, it‚Äôs not being mentioned here?

I literally called today perfectly last night, only thing I got wrong was futures but the farther you go out the harder is to predict things obviously.

My strategy for tomorrow. HODL calls. We either open very green, have a small sell off (sell off will be much smaller due to today) and then resume rallying or we open slightly red and then resume rallying. Correction appears to be ending and the market appears to be heading back into an up trend."

Once money starts reentering the economy and more cash starts circulating, we'll see a pretty decently sized burst in inflation. The only reason deflation is occurring right now is because people aren't spending as much.

There's only 1.3 trillion usually circulating in the US economy at any given point, and the US just borrowed 3 trillion to input into the US economy. Knowing this, as well as the very low Fed rates, the effect of this will probably be 3-5% inflation for a year or longer. Also bond yields suck right now, so a lot of people are pouring money into equities to compensate."

Cashed out my $120 TGT calls today when it spiked to about \~$120.60 and am still holding the $121 calls as well as all my QQQ calls. Those are down 90%+ haha.

NYSE trading floor opens up in a few weeks, just after memorial day. Those fucks will be trading like it's open season. States are reopening these next few weeks. What we saw this week was a little bit of *realistic* second wave fear, but not the inevitable rug pull..just yet.

We'll get a pull soon. But for now, we just priced in the *fear*, not the reality. All states have to open, and NYSE floor has to switch down again -- other countries are continuously in the red, and we should follow suit these coming weeks. I predict we'll hit the rug around Q2, so hold cash, and we'll retest lows. Maybe not the circuit breaker lows we had to 220, but 240 and 250 are on the menu..depending on how bad we realize opening up countries with no *vaccine* and that this will be a long-lasting recession will be. And according to '08 data, we should test even bigger lows further into 2020, or 2021.

TA said if 279 breaks, support is near 275.5. Didn't quite hit that low but still a fun ride for shorts until todays low. First 30 min of market >>tends<< to get inversed too (guess when the reversal happened, on the minute)

TA also said everything oversold (consider we are down nearly $20 by the low already). Surprise, things went back up, and over the resistance at 279. Genuine uncertainty around the 280-281 support levels, but once it broke direction was clear.

Obviously easier to say once shit has passed, but if you already have these numbers in mind you start to make decisions with purpose rather than prayer.

2020-05-14 20:35:15,2-leet-2-compete,27,"From some market article, I think this dude Kee nailed it:

> Our call of the day comes from a money manager who advises keeping things stripped for speed right now, which he does by trading just two instruments.

>Kee argues that a complicated and cumbersome portfolio, like some of the more popular ones with 20 or 30 stocks to keep track of, makes it tough to manage risk in a timely manner.

>""The ease of use of simplifying a portfolio so that it just tracks the market or goes to cash allows it to protect itself quickly, and that's essential when markets conditions are like they are today,"" Kee said, referring to Wednesday when a big market drop saw him initially move to cash, but later switch to buying the S&P 500 due the depth of that fall.

>Kee believes we are in a three-phase ""greater depression era,"" with the first coming when stocks and Main Street crashed in March. **""The second stage is when the stock market is disconnecting with Main Street and that's what we're in now,"" he said.**

>This period, which he expects to last for months, involves a **wave of ""fake money"" coming from central bank stimulus, which will keep markets rising even if there are ""swift and harsh declines"" along the way**. In this phase, investors need to ""stay broad based and ride the wave until the music stops,"" said Kee, whose models are predicting respective **95% and 50% chances of highs for the Nasdaq-100 highs and S&P by year-end.**

>That brings us to the dark **final stage, likely at the start of next year, when Fed stimulus policies end, debt levels get ""ridiculous,"" and the solvency of the Fed gets questioned**, potentially a big problem the financial industry and stocks, he said.

>Stage three is usually ""fast and harsh and brutal,"" he said. And he has a bit of advice for 401(k) players when that last stage rolls around -- move to cash. But ride the market out in the meantime."

I don't know if we'll get that high, and I don't know if we'll go past it. All I know is that if you are long, that's a fantastic place to take profit, and if you want to go short, that's a fantastic place to do it. If you go short, put your stop loss just above 288."
