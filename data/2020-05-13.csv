Some of her family members have now been confirmed to be infected as well, and fears are growing that the woman may have seeded more infections as she moved around Hong Kong’s dense city streets before being detected.

>On the Chinese mainland, an outbreak of more than 20 new infections in northeastern China has forced authorities to impose movement restrictions in two cities reminiscent of the lockdown placed on Wuhan, the city where the deadly virus first emerged. Schools that had just re-opened to students were closed again in three Chinese cities with a total population of 13 million people.  
>  
>South Korea has identified more than 100 new cases from several nightclubs frequented by gay customers. Health officials are trying to test more than 5,500 people who visited the clubs since late April, but some fear coming forward given the country’s lingering homophobia. The outbreak threatens to test a virus strategy that has gained praise around the world for containing the virus without strict lockdown measures or disruption.

CLOs are securities backed by loans, each with a different tranch. Tranches are ranked by quality of loan: investment grade, unrated and speculative. Once the loans are packaged, CLOs get another rating, based on specific terms.

Banks, insurance companies & hedge funds are holding CLOs currently. CLOs are created based on debt from companies with less than perfect credit: airlines, hotels, restaurants and entertainments are currently the most troubled CLOs.

Moody’s downgraded 20% of the underlying loans in the CLOs at the end of April, & put $44 billion additional on watch for further downgrade. This could end up downgrading the CLOs, which in turn could grade them as junk (40% are currently investment grade)

Fitch ratings anticipates $80 billion (15% of the CLO market) to default. To compare, in 2009 they stated $78 billion would fail. 14% of these CLOs are due by the end of the year, with a total 35% due by 2021.

TLDR: Here's how the crash will happen: companies go bankrupt > lenders will be unpaid due to poorly-written covenants > loans in the CLOs begin to downgrade > CLOs get rated junk > $1.4T market becomes illiquid."

2020-05-14 07:16:02,Coolegespam,2,"Debating about buying some AMAT calls. Stock is a bit on the low side, in part to the recent sell off. Earnings are likely to exceed expectation. However, future prospectus are likely to be tempted at best. It's been bouncing off the 200 Day MA, or the $54 range, but I think run up to earnings might push it through that.

Depending on future prospects, the stock might do what Intel did and crash after (mass profit taking), but pick back up over the next few days... Provided the market as a whole doesn't tank before then.

Given the range over the past week, it should hit at least $55 a share on a better then expected earnings report, with limited future warnings. Only problem, is volatility is high, and contract costs are more then I'd like for this level of risk. If I did go in, it be at the $52.50 or $52.00 strike price, which gives me an upside of about 200%. I could do a 75% stop loss, which would, in theory get me 2:1... but there's a chance my stop wont execute before the price crashes which would make that R:R, much worse.

Could strikes at the $55 level, cheaper, and higher volume, but I'd need the price to move more then 10% to make the same amount of money. Not sure the sock would have that amount of momentum in it.

Probably going to watch the stock tomorrow and see if there's a better entry point."

That's the most intense downward pressure we are likely to see today. And now we're floating up.

And after 2 red days, and on unemployment day... not looking great. Woulda been sorta awesome to see what the gap down would've looked like. I believe it'll happen eventually.

I went cash gang yesterday and I’ve been staying cash game ever since. Puts are probably safe but this will reverse, sooner rather than later. I’m watching the market like a hawk waiting for a reversal.

People now know how fast this market rebounds so they won’t be scared and pull out. The days of circuit breakers are 100% done. 

Every dip will be followed by long term investors (the guys who move stocks and aren’t just in a casino like us)  averaging into cheap stocks. 

$SPY 250 is literally the lowest possible point we can ever drop before people are buying like mad at such outrageously good deals.

The market crash has been caused by 2 things, a necessary small correction after a face ripper of a month long rally, and California and other states deciding to not re-open as soon as we all expected them to.

Fact is though the idea that the stocks will return to a normal level after this is over remains true. You can deny this, but this is the thesis the market has been and will be operating on.

Don’t get greedy. Don’t go balls deep on puts after making some money only to lose it all. Be watching closely for a rebound."

I kind of have an idea of doing a day-trade straddle on TSLA tomorrow using options that expire on the 15th. It opened at 820 today, dipped to 770s, ended at 790 and is at 799 AHs, so its got some volatility that I really think we're going to see again tomorrow as it either pumps back up, or goes full dump if SPY dumps. If spy goes sideways or up, i feel like TSLA is going to go up. but i dont feel confident enough to bet in a specific direction since we never known what SPY is going to do day to day after a day like today.

But im afraid to do this since id be using the may15th expiration date of getting messed up by theta since its so close to the end of the contracts. 

My question is how much will theta fuck me up on the 14th, throughout the day, or is theta only a factor between trading days?"

Our boi Jerome said they wanted to avoid negative interest rates (for now). The market started to price in negative interest rates, which is what the Fed wanted to avoid, so it looks like the Fed is pulling back on unlimited QE. 

Problem is the US Treasury is going to issue around $1 trillion in the next month to foot the bill for all the government gibs they’re handing out. Unless we’re willing to see increasing treasury yields in the midst of this shit show, the Fed is going to have to buy them. Printing that much in a short time will destroy the velocity of money and could send us into deflation zone.

Fucked up bigly today. Sold my calls at open, kept the puts that were already up 60% from buying em mid day yesterday. THen it started ripping from Spy -.9 to Spy +.4. So i said fuckit, ill rebuy after they run out of ink midday. Sold the puts at +40% instead of +60% at the exact top of day. oh well gains iz gains 

Then Spy fuckin collapsed. So I hastily yanked the trigger on IWM and QQQ puts. Now those are barely 5% red as of close. 

If i just held the original Spy puts they'd have been up about 140% at their peak. 100% or so at close today. 

And now instead I'm sitting on slightly red puts, but with no guarantee, and instead I could just as well lose everything i already gained from yesterday's puts

I was all cash Monday but if course I tried to squeeze my account for an extra couple hundred."

Country’s currency in a deflationary spiral? Great, hoard cash. Or better, trade other currencies. Or bonds. Or precious metals. Or OTHER COUNTRIES MARKETS. Buying this shit is as simple as buying an ETF nowadays.  

Want to be a big dick? Short the market. Buy puts. Use strangles if the market is going nowhere for decades. 

Pension fund going bust? Huh? BlackRock manages your god damn federal government pension fund. You think they’re going to sit there “buying and holding” for two decades while their entire portfolio slowly bleeds? 

Sure, some people might lose money for some period of time if their entire strategy is “buy and hold” and they take no action to fix their strategy if we find ourselves in that scenario. 

But acting like the economic scenario itself is some kind of inevitable black hole of value that will force every citizen of the nation into poverty is nonsense."

2020-05-13 22:02:02,scopolamine,3,"It is time for CLOs! The thing that will crush the markets soon. (they are basically CDOs from 2008)

CLOs are securities backed by loans, each with a different tranch. Tranches are ranked by quality of loan: investment grade, unrated and speculative. Once the loans are packaged, CLOs get another rating, based on specific terms.

Banks, insurance companies & hedge funds are holding CLOs currently. CLOs are created based on debt from companies with less than perfect credit: airlines, hotels, restaurants and entertainments are currently the most troubled CLOs.

Moody’s downgraded 20% of the underlying loans in the CLOs at the end of April, & put $44 billion additional on watch for further downgrade. This could end up downgrading the CLOs, which in turn could grade them as junk (40% are currently investment grade)

Fitch ratings anticipates $80 billion (15% of the CLO market) to default. To compare, in 2009 they stated $78 billion would fail. 14% of these CLOs are due by the end of the year, with a total 35% due by 2021.

TLDR: Here's how the crash will happen: companies go bankrupt > lenders will be unpaid due to poorly-written covenants > loans in the CLOs begin to downgrade > CLOs get rated junk > $1.4T market becomes illiquid."

This is not an amazing buying opportunity, this is course correction for the new normal for the foreseeable future.   While we might have pent up demand eventually when all restrictions are removed, what we won't have is business travel.  International and domestic business travel at most tech companies will be gone in 2020 which makes up a sizable portion of travel for both Airlines and Hotels.  As someone who traveled internationally 8-12 times a year for work, that has been cut to 0 for 2020 and likely into 2021. There will be a time to buy, but this ain't it.

1. When you Google “VectoIQ” every hit has to do with the stock, and not the company itself or what service or goods it provides. Go ahead and try all your other meme stocks - Fastly, Cornerstone On Demand, whatever. You type in the company and you get their website, their info, etc. not VectoIQ. 

2. It has four employees. That’s right. 890 million dollar market cap and the company has four employees. 

3. The description of the company sounds like the guy getting fired from Office Space explaining  his job as helping the engineers communicate with the customers. “I’m a people person!” The company literally finds other companies to merge and ... that’s worth a billion dollars? 

I’m tired of hearing about this shit.
