2020-05-14 08:58:43,scopolamine,10,">Second Waves Are Plaguing Asia‚Äôs Virus Recovery - The Bloomberg  
>  
>An elderly woman with no travel history. An unexpected flare-up in a nightclub. A swelling cluster in towns near international borders with no discernible source.  
>  
>In Hong Kong, a 66-year-old patient with no recent travel history ended the city‚Äôs much-envied 23-day streak of zero local cases this week. Some of her family members have now been confirmed to be infected as well, and fears are growing that the woman may have seeded more infections as she moved around Hong Kong‚Äôs dense city streets before being detected.  
>  
>On the Chinese mainland, an outbreak of more than 20 new infections in northeastern China has forced authorities to impose movement restrictions in two cities reminiscent of the lockdown placed on Wuhan, the city where the deadly virus first emerged. Schools that had just re-opened to students were closed again in three Chinese cities with a total population of 13 million people.  
>  
>South Korea has identified more than 100 new cases from several nightclubs frequented by gay customers. Health officials are trying to test more than 5,500 people who visited the clubs since late April, but some fear coming forward given the country‚Äôs lingering homophobia. The outbreak threatens to test a virus strategy that has gained praise around the world for containing the virus without strict lockdown measures or disruption.

Fuck, second wave is already happening in Asia. I am gonna get on long puts again."

2020-05-14 07:49:01,scopolamine,4,"It is time for CLOs! The thing that will crush the markets soon. (they are basically CDOs from 2008)

CLOs are securities backed by loans, each with a different tranch. Tranches are ranked by quality of loan: investment grade, unrated and speculative. Once the loans are packaged, CLOs get another rating, based on specific terms.

Banks, insurance companies & hedge funds are holding CLOs currently. CLOs are created based on debt from companies with less than perfect credit: airlines, hotels, restaurants and entertainments are currently the most troubled CLOs.

Moody‚Äôs downgraded 20% of the underlying loans in the CLOs at the end of April, & put $44 billion additional on watch for further downgrade. This could end up downgrading the CLOs, which in turn could grade them as junk (40% are currently investment grade)

Fitch ratings anticipates $80 billion (15% of the CLO market) to default. To compare, in 2009 they stated $78 billion would fail. 14% of these CLOs are due by the end of the year, with a total 35% due by 2021.

TLDR: Here's how the crash will happen: companies go bankrupt > lenders will be unpaid due to poorly-written covenants > loans in the CLOs begin to downgrade > CLOs get rated junk > $1.4T market becomes illiquid."

2020-05-14 07:16:02,Coolegespam,2,"Debating about buying some AMAT calls. Stock is a bit on the low side, in part to the recent sell off. Earnings are likely to exceed expectation. However, future prospectus are likely to be tempted at best. It's been bouncing off the 200 Day MA, or the $54 range, but I think run up to earnings might push it through that.

Depending on future prospects, the stock might do what Intel did and crash after (mass profit taking), but pick back up over the next few days... Provided the market as a whole doesn't tank before then.

Given the range over the past week, it should hit at least $55 a share on a better then expected earnings report, with limited future warnings. Only problem, is volatility is high, and contract costs are more then I'd like for this level of risk. If I did go in, it be at the $52.50 or $52.00 strike price, which gives me an upside of about 200%. I could do a 75% stop loss, which would, in theory get me 2:1... but there's a chance my stop wont execute before the price crashes which would make that R:R, much worse.

Could strikes at the $55 level, cheaper, and higher volume, but I'd need the price to move more then 10% to make the same amount of money. Not sure the sock would have that amount of momentum in it.

Probably going to watch the stock tomorrow and see if there's a better entry point."

I went cash gang yesterday and I‚Äôve been staying cash game ever since. Puts are probably safe but this will reverse, sooner rather than later. I‚Äôm watching the market like a hawk waiting for a reversal.

People now know how fast this market rebounds so they won‚Äôt be scared and pull out. The days of circuit breakers are 100% done. 

Every dip will be followed by long term investors (the guys who move stocks and aren‚Äôt just in a casino like us)  averaging into cheap stocks. 

$SPY 250 is literally the lowest possible point we can ever drop before people are buying like mad at such outrageously good deals.

The market crash has been caused by 2 things, a necessary small correction after a face ripper of a month long rally, and California and other states deciding to not re-open as soon as we all expected them to.

Fact is though the idea that the stocks will return to a normal level after this is over remains true. You can deny this, but this is the thesis the market has been and will be operating on.

Don‚Äôt get greedy. Don‚Äôt go balls deep on puts after making some money only to lose it all. Be watching closely for a rebound."

I kind of have an idea of doing a day-trade straddle on TSLA tomorrow using options that expire on the 15th. It opened at 820 today, dipped to 770s, ended at 790 and is at 799 AHs, so its got some volatility that I really think we're going to see again tomorrow as it either pumps back up, or goes full dump if SPY dumps. If spy goes sideways or up, i feel like TSLA is going to go up. but i dont feel confident enough to bet in a specific direction since we never known what SPY is going to do day to day after a day like today.

But im afraid to do this since id be using the may15th expiration date of getting messed up by theta since its so close to the end of the contracts. 

My question is how much will theta fuck me up on the 14th, throughout the day, or is theta only a factor between trading days?"

Our boi Jerome said they wanted to avoid negative interest rates (for now). The market started to price in negative interest rates, which is what the Fed wanted to avoid, so it looks like the Fed is pulling back on unlimited QE. 

Problem is the US Treasury is going to issue around $1 trillion in the next month to foot the bill for all the government gibs they‚Äôre handing out. Unless we‚Äôre willing to see increasing treasury yields in the midst of this shit show, the Fed is going to have to buy them.

Fucked up bigly today. Sold my calls at open, kept the puts that were already up 60% from buying em mid day yesterday. THen it started ripping from Spy -.9 to Spy +.4. So i said fuckit, ill rebuy after they run out of ink midday. Sold the puts at +40% instead of +60% at the exact top of day. oh well gains iz gains 

Then Spy fuckin collapsed. So I hastily yanked the trigger on IWM and QQQ puts. Now those are barely 5% red as of close. 

If i just held the original Spy puts they'd have been up about 140% at their peak. 100% or so at close today. 

And now instead I'm sitting on slightly red puts, but with no guarantee, and instead I could just as well lose everything i already gained from yesterday's puts

dump = im zoomed in on the 1m chart and it went down .3 percent

fake market = market is moving in the direction i dont like because of a conspiracy to fix the market

ban = your post actually made me doubt my position

this = your post confirmed my confirmation bias

is anyone else playing... = i saw a ticker in another post but still need someone to spoon feed me a trade

do X, they said, it can't go tits up, they said = i decided that the best way to spend my money was to follow advice on a subreddit famous for it's massive losses

resistance = the 1m candle stopped moving up for a second

support = the 1m candle stopped moving down for a second

volatility is high = volatility is up 5% from yesterday

ppt = futures are up and i don't know why

futures dont matter = futures are moving in a direction i dont like 

pajama traders = i don't know who is buying in futures, a market i've only ever watched. 

X are fucked = futures opened in the direction i like, so that means it'll go 5% in that direction.

2020-05-13 22:02:02,scopolamine,3,"It is time for CLOs! The thing that will crush the markets soon. (they are basically CDOs from 2008)

CLOs are securities backed by loans, each with a different tranch. Tranches are ranked by quality of loan: investment grade, unrated and speculative. Once the loans are packaged, CLOs get another rating, based on specific terms.

Banks, insurance companies & hedge funds are holding CLOs currently. CLOs are created based on debt from companies with less than perfect credit: airlines, hotels, restaurants and entertainments are currently the most troubled CLOs.

Moody‚Äôs downgraded 20% of the underlying loans in the CLOs at the end of April, & put $44 billion additional on watch for further downgrade. This could end up downgrading the CLOs, which in turn could grade them as junk (40% are currently investment grade)

Fitch ratings anticipates $80 billion (15% of the CLO market) to default. To compare, in 2009 they stated $78 billion would fail. 14% of these CLOs are due by the end of the year, with a total 35% due by 2021.

TLDR: Here's how the crash will happen: companies go bankrupt > lenders will be unpaid due to poorly-written covenants > loans in the CLOs begin to downgrade > CLOs get rated junk > $1.4T market becomes illiquid."

Bought CMCSA 45c for 1/15/21 because I think Peacock is gonna cause waves at some point, it's going to be cheap and I think it's going to take some subs from Hulu at the very least with all the NBC content it's taking from that platform.

Bought BJ 35c 6/19 yesterday for cheap and it's up.

I have paper hands, anything goes tomorrow if I see green. I own a bunch of calls and today scared me."

2. It has four employees. That‚Äôs right. 890 million dollar market cap and the company has four employees. 

3. The description of the company sounds like the guy getting fired from Office Space explaining  his job as helping the engineers communicate with the customers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a people person!‚Äù The company literally finds other companies to merge and ... that‚Äôs worth a billion dollars?
