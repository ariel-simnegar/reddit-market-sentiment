&#x200B;

With the the deal of them buying bought out at 135$/share months ago their stock has been stalemate at 135$ waiting for it to go through and now since they talking about 'renegotating' because of corona impact etc am I wrong to think that the deal is actually making the stock price go lower?

With $spy and its recent big gains past month or so am I wrong to assume that $tif would have followed with steady gains and because of their price being totally dependent on this deal it doesnt move up or down and the deal made it actually 114$ instead of its normal 130$.

Now rethinking the deal move would be a valid opinion but maybe in like march or april. Having that talk now while most stocks are recovering it seems like its stock is being held hostage.

Am I wrong to assume this? I'm 90% sure the deal will go through and think it might even stay at what the agreed on if not then 5-15$ lower.

Only asking cause I bought like 300 130$ 6/29 calls for 1 cent each and wanna see if I could sell for .02 or something."

2020-06-05 06:55:01,Gilbertgodfries,-5,"Our diversity is supposed to be our greatest strength as we bring in the best from every culture group, but what good is diversity when we all still adhere to tribalism? 

We say we're the melting pot of the world, and this is true, but we are also the most tribalistic society in the world. Face it, if you're white your more likely to feel more comfortable around white people. Same goes for every race, black, Asian, Latino, so on and so forth. You're more willing to help advance your culture and the people more alike to you. While I believe it is essential and absolutely benefital for both yourself and others like yourself to seek advancements for your people, we sometimes may have to ask ourselfs if these advancements we've made impact other members of the society. Positively? Negativity? 

But look what I've just done. I've gone back to the basics of tribalism. As a country I don't think we really have a true definition about what it means to be Amerian. Maybe we did and it got lost to time or maybe we never have. We need to really take a look at our country and unite together to look forward to the future of our country. 

If we don't, we'll end up like the Romans whose fall from grace was caused by greed, power, and a failure to assimilate from tribalism. Unfortunately, I believe we are too far from this path. Our time is near, can we be the ones to save our very own future? - gilbertgodfries"

Only reason I learned about options as being full time college student. Just dumped my unemployment into it lmao.

Don't know actual statistics but if 70k per state average have unemployment thats like what 2.1b+ /week?  from all states combined then lets say half of it gets put back in to stocks by people 1b+/week into the stock market? or is that not even enough to make a change.

1) buy 600 shares of att(T)
2) buy 600 shares on margin of att 

Total 1200 shares 

Price at let's say 32. 

Sell 6 call options at 32. For let's say 45 cents or 50 cents. Total principle about 300$ 

If stock goes up the margin 600 shares go bye bye. And my original shares gain and i do not miss the boat. 

If stock goes down sell calls again till they go away. 

Since I'll buy back in every time. Dividend on all shares. 

If stock jumps too much. My original shares allow me to margin 600 even if I miss it 


This is risky with bad companies that might fall alot. Att is stable and 2$ a year dividend is good protection."

- NBC has connects with ALGN, a TML on Nasdaq and they fear SDC.. manipulation at its finest


- Recently announced expansion of shops in Asia

- Recently partnered with all major health insurers like UnitedHealth etc

- IPO was recent so getting its legs off ground from IPO beat down slowly. $20 IPO


This is an absolute no brainer down here. String of good news recently. I got in at $4 but keep adding. 

Bonus: CEO is badass 


They really just need to beat earnings IMO and the short squeeze will he epic because the volume will come in bigly. Itll happen soon. Tons of room to run. This isnt some one day play. If you stick around for a little bit you will double your money."

These people who come out will have hugely damaging personal accounts of Trump's hubris. Things are lining up that Bush will even endorse Biden, barring Biden's team deciding against it. This is bearish but we will probably pump until the day before the election. 

I see futures up but I expect a lot of selling today to lock in profits before another weekend of these protests.

Open a brokerage account (preferably on robinhood for max retardation). Then open a Roth IRA.

In your brokerage account, make your plays. In your Roth IRA, make the *exact opposite play.*

Since you are retarded, your brokerage account will bleed cash, but your Roth IRA will make that same exact amount of cash. Basically, you'll break even, but your robinhood account will be going down and your Roth IRA will be going up.

Now, your Roth IRA has no capital gains tax and no income tax upon withdrawal. Meanwhile, the losses in your RH account will allow you to reduce your reported income on your taxes, up to $3k/yr. And, capital gains losses can rollover indefinitely.

If you do this with enough cash, you'll basically get a free pass to reduce your taxable income by $3k/yr, forever, without actually losing any money.

But at the end of the day, that same buoyant poo will always find its way back to the top of the water when it reaches the river. That‚Äôs what we are soon to experience."

PLAY has been ridden pretty hard and I‚Äôm up much bigly there, but it‚Äôs still half off pre crisis levels.

CAKE is somewhat less of a discount, but still has substantial room to get back to pre rona levels.

DRI is probably the most interesting play.  Olive Garden is a shithole but they seem to managing covid well, and DRI had been showing healthy, steady growth pre rona, unlike the other two.  Ultimately it‚Äôs still a good 25% discount from its normal trend line.

Open a brokerage account (preferably on robinhood for max retardation). Then open a Roth IRA.

In your brokerage account, make your plays. In your Roth IRA, make the *exact opposite play.*

Since you are retarded, your brokerage account will bleed cash, but your Roth IRA will make that same exact amount of cash. Basically, you'll break even, but your robinhood account will be going down and your Roth IRA will be going up. 

Now, your Roth IRA has no capital gains tax and no income tax upon withdrawal. Meanwhile, the losses in your RH account will allow you to reduce your reported income on your taxes, up to $3k. And, capital gains losses can rollover indefinitely. 

If you do this with enough cash, you'll basically get a free pass to reduce your taxable income by $3k/yr, forever, without actually losing any money.

Made Tendies. Lost tendies. Made more Tendies!!

Positions:

Market Open- Bought calls on SAVE and CCL which put me at +$7,000

Mid Day- Had this brilliant idea that FB was bound to pop! Bought a shit ton of calls. It did not pop :( .. went down -$17,000

End Day- Saw AAL shooting. Bought 200 $16 6/5c while it was trading at $15.60. Sold at $17.70. Went back up + $20,000

Side note- I strictly gamble my entire portfolio on one or two trades and pray it goes up within 2-4 minutes and then close out!

(Also, I strictly buy calls only. I refuse to ever buy a fucking put)"

Bots won't let me publish my DD so fuck it... I'll publish it here:

**Silicon Motion (SIMO)**

Autists - Today I would like to share a growth stock that's been undervalued for a while. Became more attractive than ever with today's dip. Our DD today is on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. - they engage in the development, manufacture, and supply of semiconductor products for the electronics market. They offer embedded and expandable storage, radio frequency integrated circuits, and embedded graphics. The reason why I've decided to take the extra leap of doing DD is because I saw a few technical signs that the stock may see a big spike soon. Here's a summary of my findings:

* **Exceptional Earnings Performance:** While the historical EPS growth rate for Silicon Motion is 3.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 22.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.5%.
* **Positive Outlook Into Q2 Earnings:** The current-year earnings estimates for Silicon Motion have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month.
* **Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio:** Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator for companies like SIMO. Right now, Silicon Motion has an S/TA ratio of 0.71, which means that the company gets $0.71 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.66, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
* **Solid yield will soon attract big money:** With a seven-year payment history and a 3.3% yield, many investors probably find Silicon Motion Technology intriguing. Shareholders always check that Silicon Motion Technology‚Äôs dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. I think Silicon Motion Technology has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. This, coupled with the earnings growth, is a good sign that large institutional investors will soon buy into SIMO.
* **Competitors have surged, it's now time for SIMO:** The company‚Äôs main competitors (and peers) include Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) that is trading 21.93% up over the past 12 months. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) is 28.87% up on the 1-year trading charts.
* **P/E Ratio:** SIMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.51, which is far below the semiconductor industry average of 19.48. For reference one of SIMO's main competitors, LSCC has a forward P/E of 35.90. SIMO outperforms competition based on this metric.
* **Improving Sentiment On Asian Markets:** Although SIMO is not technically a ""Chinese"" stock, it is important to note that Hong Kong‚Äôs stock market recently had its biggest gain since the end of March, even though the United States is set to scrap its special trading status, as optimism rose that the Trump administration will not sanction Beijing for passing a controversial national security law for the city. Regardless of this, SIMO is a HSI stock and is compliant with international trade regulations.

Bottom line: Silicon Motion is a solid growth stock with stellar fundamentals. The company is long overdue a big spike, so I expect this stock to jump anywhere from 10-15% in the next rally this month, so load up on June/July calls for maximum gains. You'll also find that IV is pretty low (around 38% for June calls) - an opportunity for those who want to ride the IV fluctuations for quick gains."

**Silicon Motion (SIMO)**

Autists - Today I would like to share a growth stock that's been undervalued for a while. Became more attractive than ever with today's dip. Our DD today is on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. - they engage in the development, manufacture, and supply of semiconductor products for the electronics market. They offer embedded and expandable storage, radio frequency integrated circuits, and embedded graphics. The reason why I've decided to take the extra leap of doing DD is because I saw a few technical signs that the stock may see a big spike soon. Here's a summary of my findings:

* **Exceptional Earnings Performance:** While the historical EPS growth rate for Silicon Motion is 3.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 22.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.5%.
* **Positive Outlook Into Q2 Earnings:** The current-year earnings estimates for Silicon Motion have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month.
* **Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio:** Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator for companies like SIMO. Right now, Silicon Motion has an S/TA ratio of 0.71, which means that the company gets $0.71 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.66, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
* **Solid yield will soon attract big money:** With a seven-year payment history and a 3.3% yield, many investors probably find Silicon Motion Technology intriguing. Shareholders always check that Silicon Motion Technology‚Äôs dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. I think Silicon Motion Technology has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. This, coupled with the earnings growth, is a good sign that large institutional investors will soon buy into SIMO.
* **Competitors have surged, it's now time for SIMO:** The company‚Äôs main competitors (and peers) include Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) that is trading 21.93% up over the past 12 months. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) is 28.87% up on the 1-year trading charts.
* **P/E Ratio:** SIMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.51, which is far below the semiconductor industry average of 19.48. For reference one of SIMO's main competitors, LSCC has a forward P/E of 35.90. SIMO outperforms competition based on this metric.
* **Improving Sentiment On Asian Markets:** Although SIMO is not technically a ""Chinese"" stock, it is important to note that Hong Kong‚Äôs stock market recently had its biggest gain since the end of March, even though the United States is set to scrap its special trading status, as optimism rose that the Trump administration will not sanction Beijing for passing a controversial national security law for the city. Regardless of this, SIMO is a HSI stock and is compliant with international trade regulations.

Bottom line: Silicon Motion is a solid growth stock with stellar fundamentals. The company is long overdue a big spike, so I expect this stock to jump anywhere from 10-15% in the next rally this month, so load up on June/July calls for maximum gains. You'll also find that IV is pretty low (around 38% for June calls) - an opportunity for those who want to ride the IV fluctuations for quick gains.

**Positions:** SIMO 50c 6/19 calls"

I put a stop limit at a contract price equivalent to a stock price of roughly $37.80 to lock in those sweet gains. Market closes just above my stop, 5 minutes later, stock price drops 20% basically wiping out all my profits. Everything happened right after closing bell, so my stop was out of play. 

Now, if I keep the stop, it'll sell off right away in the morning, and I can fucking guarantee you people will buy the dip and I would effectively be selling at the bottom.

2020-06-04 21:16:58,,8,"Here's how to cook your weed into olive oil so you stop destroying your lungs.

You need: 

A casserole dish 

About 28g of weed 

About 300mL of olive oil 

Cheesecloth

Preheat your oven to 115 deg c (240 deg f). Coarse grind your weed and spread it out in your casserole dish. Dry bake your weed for exactly 40 minutes. This decarboxylates the THC so it becomes bioavailable. Remove dish from oven, add olive oil, stir. Set oven to 100 deg c (210 deg F) and bake for at least 40 minutes, no more than 90. This speeds up the transfer of cannabinoids to the olive oil. Remove from oven, stir, and let cool. Strain through cheesecloth, squeezing the oil out of the herb.

Voila! You now have approximately 250 mL of weed oil with approximately 10 to 20 mg of THC per ml. Take 1-2 mL (half a teaspoon) with food. You'll be high in an hour and a half and ripped for about 6 hours."

2020-06-04 20:57:31,RayCashIsTrashDalio,5,"im assuming today's bigly rally in some stocks was a massive short squeeze. bears got trapped bigly yesterday/today and got fucked hard. the shittiest of stocks like AAL (up 40% today), is probably the one that has the highest chance of bankruptcy and is the shittiest airline to invest in long-term, yet it was up 40% today whereas other airlines were only up 15%. you also have LK which is up 57%. im guessing a bunch of fucking retards shorted it at the bottom at $2 even though its already down 98% from the top. then today, some big hedge fund or something decided to fuck with bears and buy up the most heavily shorted stocks to trigger a massive squeeze. AAL got downgraded to B- from B yesterday due to higher chance of bankruptcy and im guessing bears fell for it and short attacked it after hearing the news. big funds saw a huge opportunity to trigger a squeeze. there was really not much other new news today which couldve triggered the rally. 

tldr: most likely a short squeeze started by hedge funds trying to fuck bears. buy stocks that are heavily shorted and have the highest chance of bankruptcy and wait for the short squeeze"

Experts suggest that Buffet was fed up with his paper hands sale of airline stocks a few months ago. Analysts suspect that the 41% surge of American Airlines stock today was the ""final straw"" for the infamous business tycoon.

*Update: We are getting word that Buffet yelled out ""They will not cuck me! I will have the last laugh and they will have GUH'd their last GUH"" at an emergency Berkshire Hathaway Zoom meeting.*"

And then again,

As virgins are bound to do.

Should I ‚Äúhold thru earnings?‚Äù

What‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuy on rumor?‚Äù

And what‚Äôs ‚ÄúSell the fucking news?‚Äù

/

So gather close,

With your tendie greed

And I‚Äôll tell you, my newbie chum.

These are the ways that Wall Street bets

Ends up fucking your fucking mum.

/

Don‚Äôt hold thru earnings,

Not right now.

When hype is the game we play.

The run up is the thing me boy.

The ‚Äúmaybes, ifs, and mays‚Äù

Because once those quantities are known.

We run the fuck away.

/

What‚Äôs ‚ÄúIV crush?‚Äù

I hear you ask?

I‚Äôll tell you stout and true.

IV crush is what happens when

You get fucked by theta crew.

Be much afraid

Of these vulture dicks.

Where they hide is plain to see.

In stagnant stocks.

And calls pushed aloft

By the winds of greedy glee.

And so I close,

My little tale

Now go, and walk the walk.

May the tendies rain, in JPow‚Äôs name.

And thanks for coming to my TED talk."

2020-06-04 20:26:43,PlasticRice,11,"The year is 2025. 

Coronavirus has no possible vaccine, as its rampant mutations outlast every world government's ability to solve the previous strain. COVID has mutated to the point where it is spreadable through eye contact and recontractible by sniffing the air of an infected patient within a 5 mile radius.

All school is online. Online universities such as Liberty University have went from being Ponzi Schemes to more difficult to get into than Harvard.

Indices are still green. Jerome has added 'Federal Printer Ink' to the federal balance sheet, taking up 98% of U.S. GDP to keep investors happy. $SPY is now at 4,269. 

**""any second now,"" the last bear said. ""There's no way we go past $4,500, right? I've drawn all the lines, read all the DD on Grindr. I'm going to buy even more puts,"" he said, as he ate spam and chicken noodle soup for dinner for the fourth year in a row.**

$ZM is now worth more than all three ETFs combined. Zoom has taken over the world, any and all actions are recorded and logged into Zoom's permanent databank of Human Beings. From birth, people are assigned numbers with associating letters -- akin to a social security number, except branded onto their foreheads, which allows them to log into Zoom for anything and everything: going to work, using vending machines, or even permission to sleep.

I check my RobinHood. It has been awhile since I've invested. I've spent the last five years in a bunker, waiting for the next dip to buy into. My portfolio, worth a few thousand dollars, should be worth about the same amount, right?

I check investing.com to gauge the value of the dollar. It can't be. What a penny was worth in 2020 is now worth millions. People no longer pay for groceries with actual amounts; instead, they weigh the amount of money necessary to buy products. I immediately try and see the price of a hamburger. 30 pounds of dollars, they say.

I go back into my bunker. I weep, gently, the door closing in front of me. My glorified gambling career is over. I log into my laptop, and now have to change ""Amateur Investor"" on my resume to ""Failed Doomer.""

It is the end."
