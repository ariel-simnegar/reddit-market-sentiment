The cuticle is the layer of clear skin laying at the base of your nail bed above the nail. The easiest way to¬† care for them is to soak¬†your foot in soapy, warm water for around 10 minutes every few days. This helps soften the¬†cuticle and keep your nails clean (it also feels like a nice treat for yourself). You can also use a clean instrument to gently work the cuticle towards the base of the nail ( I like to just use my fingernails.) See you at the next level!"

2019-12-17 23:06:14,dcss_west,83,"some clown posted in here 'whats rsi and macd, how do you use them intra day' and then deleted his post like a coward.. well, i just spent 10 minutes writing a answer so here it is  
  
they are oscillators.  rsi tracks overbought and oversold signals, macd tracks momentum.  ill show you how to use them for intra-day.  
  
look at a couple hours on today's spy chart.  [here](https://i.imgur.com/oce4zfa.png)  
  
so, how could you have used rsi and macd to make money on these spikes?  well, check it out  
  
[oscillators giving you clues](https://i.imgur.com/Jfe8C4C.png)  
  
if you look at the red circle, you can see spy was climbing up.  in the purple circle, the rsi was reaching 70, which is that top line.  anything above this signals overbought.  it bounced off of that, as should generally be expected.  then spy started pumping again.  this time, as you can see in the red circle, spy went to an even higher high than the first pump.  but notice how the rsi didnt go as high this time?  
  
this is called bearish divergence.  when the stock price pumps higher than the last peak, but the rsi does not follow it to an equivalent higher high, its a good indicator that the rally is losing steam, and the price is about to take a little dive.  as you can see, it did.  you could have spotted that bearish divergence in real time, bought puts, rode that big red wave down, and sold them as soon as the rsi was down closer to the bottom line (oversold).  free money  
  
take a look at the macd.  the blue line is the macd, which is the momentum of the stock.  up or down.  the yellow line is called the signal line - its the same thing, momentum, but in a much more rounded way.  its more like just the general trend.  with macd, your buy and sell signals are when the macd line crosses the signal line.  this means that the actual movement of the stock has changed rapidly in comparison to the general trend - rapidly enough to actually pass it up on the chart.  this is the moment that the momentum has shifted and you should consider entering/exiting positions.  
  
i circled some from that first example in yellow.  you can see how the first yellow circle, the macd line crossed south of the signal line.  this means you should buy puts, right?  maybe.. but look at the rsi.  up until that point, did the rsi give you any clues that the price was about to drop?  my eyes say no.  so, as expected, the macd stayed glued to the signal line and very quickly passed back north of it again.  however, in the second yellow circle, you can see that the macd crossed south of the signal line again.  THIS time, when you look at the stock candles, and the rsi, you can clearly see the bearish divergence.  the stock price hit a higher high, but the rsi hit a lower high.  the pump has run out of steam, the macd line just crossed south of the signal line, bam.  all your signals are there, so you buy puts.  and, as you can see, the price of spy dropped 35-40 cents right afterwards.  
  
now if you look at the orange circles - you'll see that the crash has seemingly ended here, as the macd line crossed north of the signal line.  this means the downward momentum is over, and the price is going to climb, right?  well, again, not necessarily.  look at the rsi in this moment - its barely above 40.  it is not even remotely overbought.  i would not enter a position here.  if i still had my short position from the bearish divergence earlier though, that macd crossing north of the signal line would definitely be my clue to exit it and take my profits.  
  
now, as for the green circles.  the rsi tells you here that it's very oversold.  this usually means its going to get bought up shortly by the fuckin algo robots (it was).  but during that first bounce where the rsi was under 30, what was the macd at?  had the macd line crossed north of the signal line yet, indicating the change in momentum?  nope.  so you wait.  and, as you can see, the price bounced but immediately fell again.  this time it bounced again right off of the rsi 30 oversold line, and you can see the macd line cross the signal line.. that's your moment.  buy calls here.  and, as you can see, the stock went up up and away.  
  
this stuff happens all day every day.  you can see it in real time and use it to make as much money as you want.  good luck"

And so it begins. I knew it. FDX keeps losing on earnings after earnings while being touted as the ""rival"" of UPS when meanwhile UPS is going tit for tat with Amazon without a care in the world about FDX. This ain't 2005 anymore."
