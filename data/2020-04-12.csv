2020-04-14 02:22:22,diicembr,1,"Looking at the consolidation pattern in after hours today, and a very similar consolidation pattern last night, with no real ""news"", I'm again left to think that there will be a pre-market gap down, likely followed by a rise. I consider this to be an institutional manipulation to hedge   
 risk. If we see upward consolidation again right before opening, we should expect a strong early (1.5 minutes should confirm) drop, and a similar day pattern. As my thesis that growth is slower, due to compounding rather than exploding, if the day is a slow grow, we should see a slight down followed by a reversal around the 5-10 minute (likely on the earlier side of that)  marker that starts our ladder'ed climb. Check twitter in the morning, and until you hear major news, expect a grind either way. 

I see no reason for large growth or failure with today's press conference."

High yield bonds are like equity where you limit upside and get promised big preferred dividend. 

Im no genius but some of that capital might actually legitimately be a happy owner of equity. You could even try to sell some calls on that equity & end up haviging a instrument with somehow similar risk & payoff profile ?

Especially if there will someday be inflation I think equity might be the choice between the 2.

The bailout package (PPP) is essentially unemployment - free cash to the airlines to keep everyone on payroll, even if they have nothing to do. Wouldn't it be cheaper for everyone, both tax payers and airlines, to let these people go like the other 16M unemployed and collect benefits? Instead, it seems like a 2 tiered unemployment - airline workers just get to keep their existing salaries while pretending to work, and their average salaries are presumably higher than unemployment. I understand the industry has some strategic value, so you give them enough to stay a going concern, but do we really need to fund all the excess workers?"

2020-04-13 05:47:01,mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,2,"There's a terrifying theory that I read about over a month ago that the virus likes to mutate just like HIV and change it's coronavirus outer sheath. This means as the body goes through the normal immune-loop to produce an anti-body for Generation 1 of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide, you then go asymptomatic again and viral load drops enough that you're clean on a test. The virus mutates and a new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti-bodies and the immune-loop process repeats.

The body resolves that, potentially a 14-20+ day process and gets Gen-2 but by that time Gen3/Gen4/Gen5 may now exist and the same loop starts again. 

You catch this and **theoretically** could need to be on anti-virals for the rest of your life, just like AIDS patients.

This is why more and more emerging evidence of  ""reinfections"" or ""reactivations"" are so concerning to me. Still too early to prove or disprove this as far as I can tell."

2020-04-13 03:47:52,LingeringDildo,12,"Hey retards. John Titor here from 2040 offering some advice from the future.

&#x200B;

* Current cases are about 5-10% of the actual infections. There are tens of millions of infections world wide at the moment.
* Remdesivir works but Gilead has some trouble ramping up production. China ends up mass producing it in violation of their patent. Long GILD in the next few months but get out as soon as the FDA approval pops their stock. Buy back in when the dust clears because Gilead ends up doing really cool stuff this decade.
* Vaccines end up harder than they look and are significantly delayed. I don't recommend being part of the trial groups going on. Sorry Bill Gates.
* Contact tracing never takes off in the US but is very effective in other countries.
* Social distancing is bullshit. You're all breathing each other's air in a grocery store, for example. This virus can spread for hours inside with circulating air and the R0 value is significantly higher indoors. Social distancing is theatre. Don't touch strangers and wear a mask and goggles (yes the virus can infect you when it reaches your eyes.)
* Things aren't normal for a while. There are second waves and sometimes third waves. Yes this is the new Great Depression and consumer buying habits are permanently changed.
* Malls take an interesting twist. Lots of these end up becoming specialized apartment complexes (you'd be surprised how nice a Macy's can be restored) with some breweries and other niceties.
* AMC doesn't survive and most people start streaming movies out of their houses. Theaters that are left become novelties that stream old movies, etc, for bored people with disposal income.
* Feds never end up buying equities directly in during this crisis but they do during the next one.
* Option skew is permanently affected by this event. Much like in 1987, investors now realize that at any moment the economy can be significantly disrupted by a pandemic. OTM puts become a permanent part of many portfolio strategies. 
* Stimulus has its limits and policy makers start taking into account social unrest from governments picking winners and losers. This dramatically affects how the next financial crisis is handled."

To prove it look at deaths in Spain and Italy on the IMHE Website. The predicted models are with confidence interval 95%. The actual deaths in both Italy and Spain are breaking their upper bound. The model is based on the assumption that the Wuhan curve was accurate. To look go IMHE website, then compare the predicted deaths to the deaths on each date according to worldometer.

\-If UCO is up and my two calls are profit zone, sell at open. Strike/exp is $3 on 5/15. I don't think oil will stay up, so I'll take this win if I can. Will hold my USO leaps ($6 and $8 for Jan 2022). I have 2 other $6 USO calls for 1/21, which I will sell if positive too.

\-Sell my SNAP calls for 10/16 at $14 strike. Hopefully these stay green, currently up 12%.

\-Will role whatever profit from UCO and/or SNAP into something stupid, like MGM leaps for 2022. Wouldn't mind MSFT for 1/21 calls either."

I've made hundreds of trips to the corner gas station and have been storing gasoline in milk jugs / plastic containers in my basement. I'm sure gasoline will go up to $4 within a few years and I can easily double my money filling people's tanks in my garage. My only problem is my house REEKS of gasoline and it's making me light headed. This investing is much more difficult than you guys make it out to be.

Was short-term optimistic last week while bears got slayed. But now I honestly don‚Äôt know now. Interested in Wells Fargo / JP Morgan earnings report on Tuesday.

There‚Äôs almost too many people that flip flopped to being bullish at the end of last week. I only eyeballed weekend discussion and tomorrow‚Äôs discussion though.

Was going to play the bank earnings as bullish just because people can argue the moral reasons and of printing money, but face value it is inflationary. Trillions of dollars brrrrrrr.

But now I saw more people basically expecting JPM to rocket on earnings again... we‚Äôll see where we land tomorrow. If setup looks nice then maybe, but if we green dick up tomorrow morning I‚Äôll probably stay cash until after Tuesday."

Which makes this whole sub more hilarious. You guys have turned him into a villian but for the most part he just parades out and says words.

Look into how the great depression ended. It ended when people started expecting inflation. That's all he is doing. ""I'm being reckless and I'm going to cause inflation because I'm not worried about it"". It's all for show, just like everything in this fucking administration."
