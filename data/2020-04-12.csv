2020-04-14 02:22:22,diicembr,1,"Looking at the consolidation pattern in after hours today, and a very similar consolidation pattern last night, with no real ""news"", I'm again left to think that there will be a pre-market gap down, likely followed by a rise. I consider this to be an institutional manipulation to hedge   
 risk. If we see upward consolidation again right before opening, we should expect a strong early (1.5 minutes should confirm) drop, and a similar day pattern. As my thesis that growth is slower, due to compounding rather than exploding, if the day is a slow grow, we should see a slight down followed by a reversal around the 5-10 minute (likely on the earlier side of that)  marker that starts our ladder'ed climb. Check twitter in the morning, and until you hear major news, expect a grind either way. 

I see no reason for large growth or failure with today's press conference."
