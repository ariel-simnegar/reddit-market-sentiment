Guess what? The outbreak is not slowing down in NY, the positivity rate of tests has gone way up since 11 days ago. The average for the last 7 days is a whopping 48.2%, which means that the outbreak is getting worse (more people are in serious need of a test every day even though the number of tests has gone up substantially...this is the definition of an exponential outbreak)."

2020-04-06 06:38:21,RationalPolicy,11,"So let me get this straight. 

The Saudis and Russians are close to a deal on the production of oil, and may decline supply of oil to an undisclosed amount. Understandably, this would increase the price of oil to a point. And an increase in the price of oil would help the US energy sector to a point, which is a sector drowning in toxic debt. I can see the bullish signs on that. 

But an increase in the price of oil would make the cost of goods go up due to the transport infrastructure of most goods in the country. Add the fact that 80 countries just went to the IMF for emergency loans and bailouts. Then add the fact we really don‚Äôt have a goddamn clue what is going to happen with this epidemic. Additionally, a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped recover in the economy is flat out naive to believe given the unprecedented job loss we have and how hesitant most people and companies will be to jump right back into spending and hiring. Even with the Federal Reserve increasing the money supply, they buy assets off of the balance sheets of banks mostly. It takes time for that money to hit the financial markets, including for it to be allocated into equity. 

So why in the fuck are futures going up? Do basic financial and economic principles not apply anymore?"

Wake up, there is no path to return to normal life before a vaccine. The market was shitting its pants last week not because of 100k deaths, but because Trump said ""30 more days"" after weeks of saying ""we open up at Easter"".


So here we are. If you think that 30 days is a reasonable amount of time and consumer spending will be the same coming May, this is your chance. Buy calls, shares or whatever, go balls deep in this. 
If, instead, you have a functioning brain, just wait and sleep well at night. There will be an endless stream of ""30 more days"", since the underlying problem is still far from being resolved."

2020-04-06 04:47:05,Lolsmileyface13,44,"some conclusions I'm slowly starting to believe following this crisis:

1. america will not be locked down. I was mistaken in thinking this would happen. It would have saved many more lives but they won't do this. 

2. The current widely shared meds won't do anything, and mortality will sit at 75%-80%+ of intubated patients as long as critical levels of patients are high. We're seeing this in our ICUS.  IL1/6 inhibitors are promising but way too expensive for the masses. 

3. I do believe the final death count will be under 75k for THIS YEAR. Most of the country (re: not the retarded states) has been distancing well, unlike my wonderful home of ny, and does not have the explosive growth in cases we did. 

4. Covid will come back with a vengeance this fall but not as strongly as it did this past month. A vaccine will not benefit the population this year. 

5. The markets will continue to stabilize. I'm no longer anticipating any major drops. The market prices in deaths, and with europe flattening the curve, and apparently NYC (lol) doing so spiking the market, we're done dramatically falling. We won't shoot back up to 300+ but I wouldn't be surprised if we overcorrected and then settled in the 280-300 range for the rest of the year. Govt will spin unemployment as always. second stimulus will be proposed, further bankrupting us. 

6. The feds will continue minimizing and ridiculing NYC's response and preparedness to COVID (which I am somewhat proud of) and use it as part of their bargaining chip to reopen the country earlier. 

7. Birx and fauci def do it on the reg. Trump watches and diddles his peen while mouthing ""hydroxychluuuuuoroquine""

TLDR: idk. no one reads this shit anyways. its 1 am"

Just a note to give you bears some hope. Market bottoms are never made when volatility is highest. 

However, this humble retards opinion is that we won‚Äôt be making any new fresh lows in S&P because people are starting to realize that jobless claims aren‚Äôt due to a weak economy.

Green open into circuit breaker selloff or massive green week for no reason maybe. Alternative is slow decays and VIX is relatively fucked. Hard to tell if people want the dollar more than normal or if they're moving assets to hedge in equities and bet on near term increases.

Edit: stonk futures up bigger, gold down more, oil found new resistance, 10 year yield higher. I think this may be the run up to a cash run now. If gold and oil go down, 10 year yield goes up, and futures go up substantially that means a lot of people want to start hedging/scalping set-in prices fast. Volatility should be back this week. Cash gang should be happy about this."

Wherever oil ends up, I imagine that chart's going to be bouncy as hell for weeks or months. Puts and calls are both gonna print. I don't see any reason it can't go lower and stay low if I just consider basic supply and demand, but it also ""can't"" stay low, because this price war is nothing but harmful to both the broader market and to exporting nations. My guess is that multiple countries are going to massively expand their oil storage capacity and drain the market to inflate the price...eventually."
