2020-06-22 09:34:55,mastershake142,8,"As a dicked over gay bear, I've been thinking a lot about the bull case. And two things stick in my mind, 1) with bond yields so low, even if the returns on stocks are expected to be low, they are still expected to be >0% until the market is truly over-extended, pushing money into the stock market. 2) Normies haven't been spending money. We are basically in an environment where the potential investors, IE, the actual middle class (not laborers and service workers) are doing just as well as ever in terms of income, while the businesses they work for are the ones struggling.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/21/banks-have-grown-by-2-trillion-in-deposits-since-coronavirus-first-hit.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/21/banks-have-grown-by-2-trillion-in-deposits-since-coronavirus-first-hit.html) 

IMO, this is a bubble. This is clearly a bubble. But, it isn't really set to pop yet, and probably won't until the fed stops propping things up with purchases. At some point they will begin to unwind their investments, and the slow bleed will turn into a torrent when the wanna-be-day traders start to leak money and flee, or their jobs are actually threatened, which can't really happen while the fed is holding back the solvency crisis. 

I guess I'll keep riding huya until the technicals give out, buy the dips on blue chips, and drop some profits into VXX periodically. I think one thing that does appear clear is that the red days are pretty red, and are usually enough to cause significant profitable spikes on VXX calls."

Imagine going in on puts when the bottom of the most recent rally was clearly in after Friday’s dump & an entire 2 weeks worth of sessions of consolidation.... knowing J Pow still has his printer. It’s almost too easy. I’m beginning to think you bears just can’t wait to have your peach split open by some giant green dildos.

INGLESBY: I think it's a combination of more testing and a real and important spike in many cases, in many states across the country. And you can distinguish what is more testing from what is more serious disease from looking at hospitalization rates, ICU rate, and the percent positivity of the overall tests in a given state.

And in many states, in the ones that you just showed, particularly Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, what we are seeing is increased positivity in testing and in many cases increased hospitalization, so serious illness happening. That's not just because we're doing more testing in a state, that's because there is more serious disease in a state."

2020-06-22 04:07:16,narcandistributor,6," 

%57 of Americans say that an unexpected $500 bill would put them into debt. All these fucks living right on the edge of debt.

Right now people are getting their addt'l $600/wk.

Where is that money going? Savings accounts, stock market, rent, food, maybe a little bit of retail at least for May... Come July, this is very likely to go away unless the Senate's sentiment shifts in very near future. Banks are going to start seeing more defaults. People are going to start struggling- it will be a couple of months before it starts having tangible implications.

The every day citizen is doing pretty good right now. Once that changes I expect to start seeing the markets representing a closer number to fair value given the current state. This is going to happen eventually- hard to say when. Until that point you have both the REPO market and retail investors putting money into this thing. Could the rollover be starting now? Perhaps, the momentum has definitely gone away in the past week. But remember, people are doing ok. Repos still in play- fed buying debt freeing up money for institutions to put into the market. Forget COVID numbers - liquidity is what matters- both with citizens & institutions. But don't discount covid- it could very well cause people to panic sell. I think the weekly candle for this coming week is really going to solidify some answers. Either way I don't think the second leg down is anytime soon; doesn't mean we can't see 270-280- but its just as likely we see 320 330.

Just typing out my thoughts to help me personally process them.

Be patient- that is fucking hard. Look at the gain porn recently, see any from SPY puts? Don't chase after that gain porn- thats just going to give you unrealistic expectations. Sure it might happen occasionally- but I have missed out on 10s of thousands of dollars by not taking profits when I should have."

Alright listen up, outer banks has been a huge success for netflix and everyone is talking about it.


Ford is releasing the 2021 bronco, we know it's going to be shaped like a jeep wrangler with a lot of the same features, the price is supposed to well undercut the wranglers. Bronco is going after the jeep wrangler and it could cause waves in the off road world. Now here is where things get crazy, The 2021 bronco trim lines got leaked, and the mid tier trim level name is, yup you guessed it, outer banks. I think the bronco is going to sell like crazy in the 2021 market.

Now by the time season 2 comes out, because of the delay of covid-19 it's going to come out in 2022, or maybe even 2023, so by this time everyone will be seeing free marketing for netflix with the ford bronco outer banks trims driving around everywhere.

Theory: the market believes cases will have limited impact on economical recovery and mainly employment.

If restaurants/malls businesses will continue to stay open amid rising cases, employment and consumer spending will rise. The Orange Man has zero influence on lockdowns, but most states even blue states cannot afford a prolonged 2nd shutdown.

That's not to say XLE, XLF, XLRE, XRT won't be affected and SPY will dump once in a while likely a rolling W, but IMO the following stocks will continue to rise as QQQ becomes the new safe haven for institutional investors need to generate beta.

This virus isn't going away until there is a vaccine, which will be a long time still. So what do we have? People hiding in their homes for a year or more? That's not looking good for recovery.

If you assume that there is full/partial immunity after you've been sick...every COVID case is another person that doesn't have to worry and can safely rejoin the economy. Countries with the highest cases will have the largest/most effective ""herd immunity"" and recover faster. As long as the hospitals aren't overwhelmed, higher cases might be a good thing.

TLDR: Higher COVID cases may be bullish. Thoughts?"

"" Typical features of a bubble include pervasive optimism about future profits, heavy flows into stocks without regard to valuation and massive share issuance by new companies – all animated by “New Era” delusions and driving unchecked momentum in prices.

What do we have now? Persistent skepticism by traditional retail investors, as gauged by the predominance of bears over bulls in recent American Association of Individual Investors surveys. More money flowing out of stock funds than in over the past few months. A sense among the public that “everything has changed” as a result of the Covid-19 epidemic – but not for the better.

Critics love to invoke 1999 as a template for what they see as a tenuously expensive and speculative market now. But there’s no real comparison.

The Nasdaq 100, dominated by the most profitable companies on the planet, today trades for 28-times expected earnings, versus 80-times in ’99. Oppenheimer technical strategist Ari Wald notes that the NDX is up 125% the past five years – which is how much it gained in the 12 months leading to the March 2000 bubble peak.

Sure, there have been some opportunistic secondary offerings recently by retail-trader favorites Nikola and DraftKings. But in 1999, there were more than 500 IPOs and their average first-day stock pop was above 60%.

Since 2000, after which the Nasdaq fell some 75%, commentators have been quick to cry “bubble.” Early in the 2003-2007 bull run, it was common to cite an “echo Internet bubble” after Google’s IPO, when in fact it was the enduring growth of Web 2.0.

There is no doubt that stocks doing well while the economy reels with some of the worst labor and manufacturing data ever collected is a matter of some dissonance. But this isn’t new.

For years after the March 2009 bear-market bottom, skeptics cited the Wall Street-Main Street disconnect, as in this chart widely circulated back in 2010. The market kept rising for years thereafter – with several stumbles along the way, sure, but none of them devastating. """

Stocks would open up, then close in the red as weak stomached traders read the FUD of a ""second wave"" and media hysteria. It all looked so bleak. Bears were dancing, J Pow knew he had to shake out weak hands if he wanted to go any higher. Robinhood traders were tarnished and reputations tainted. ""BuBble bubble"" they yell, not realizing that not everything is overvalued. Market is being driven by a select group of stocks. We saw extreme volatility. We have bounced off the 300 level a few times, building great consolidation and a base at those levels & between 301-307 (your sacrifice was not in vain 310-313 buyers) now that we've bounced around in this channel for a while its time for daddy J Pow to pull out the shot gun & take out the greedy bears that are still dancing.

Bears, initially overjoyed to see some movement, seem to have forgotten the massive headwind futures have to overcome to not print from after hours friday.

Theta freaks, smelling of the blood of once living, thriving creatures, hiss and smile to themselves and dance dark dances in their caves, marveling at the stupidity of everyone.

Puts on bulls

puts on bears

Do you fear death? I ask why, when death will come to you regardless of if you embrace it warmly or kick and scream as it drags you from this life.

Do you fear failure? I ask why, when so many have failed so many times and then gone on to succeed immensely.

Do you fear ostracization from your community? I ask why, when you already despise the presence of half of them and care so little for them as a whole.

There is no option but to live the life that your heart is compelled to live. The one that calls to you from deep within your soul, regardless of how loud and constantly your brain shouts over it. Live that life immediately my friends, do not burden yourself with chains that aren't real."

I'm not trying to post politics here, but when they coincide with the market I have to at least feign interest. If this truly is past-tense, tabled trade deal talks are not priced in. 

I think we all know that US-China talks aren't exactly breaking records for expediency, or even diplomacy at this point, however, they're incredibly important to the market and right now it seems like we're on a pause and considering both tariffs and sanctions.

Sorry the cigarettes took so long, I met this hot little 19 year old number at the 7-11 and one thing led to another.

I can only give you one piece of advice, and it comes straight from my heart to yours.

When you go out to a bar, dress well, in tailored clothes, pleated pants are a no go, keep the inseam a little short to draw attention to your shoes.  These should be polished.

When you put your hands in your pants pockets, never sweep your jacket out of the way.  Hands should go over the bottom seam of the jacket.

Shirt, high quality, good collar.  French cuffs if you’re going to be wearing it sleeves down.  Traditional cuff is fine but always roll back on itself so it sits just under your elbows. This is a no go under a jacket.

Finally. Button up your shirt so the buttons are unaligned by one, and put on some high dollar cologne.  Women cannot stand to see a well dressed man with his shirt askew, she’ll come up to fix it.  Just shut your fucking mouth, look bemused, and you’re getting laid tonight my boy."
