2020-01-22 23:49:28,urfriendosvendo,8,"The most notable previous coronavirus outbreak happened back in 2003 with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. During the peak of the SARS scare from December 2002 to April 2003, the S&P 500 dropped 8.3% and stocks related to discretionary spending and emerging markets (particularly China) underperformed. At the same time, the price of gold jumped 4.8%.

The good news is that over the next six months after the scare, the S&P 500 more than made up for its losses, gaining 18.6%.

More recently, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spooked investors starting in late 2012. From Nov. 1, 2012 to Dec. 1, 2012, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% while the price of gold increased 0.5%. This time, the S&P 500 bounced back from the scare much more quickly, gaining 15.1% over the next six months.

She’s a slut, but only for me

I wouldn’t trade her for anything, even for another gorgeous girl with a degree and full of health.

I make good money, and have no problem being the sole provider.

So that being said, she’s a woman who’s dedicated to me, and it’s extremely attractive.

I think women try to act like men, and these are the results...

Be sexy, be feminine, be a hoe. When you’re 75 are you really gonna regret being the girl that guys coveted? 

Look at women who are 40 plus, they fucking die for attention when they don’t have it. I’ve banged milfs, and damn they are fun as hell. They mention a lot about being too conservative in their youth. 

Also, for the guys, if you bang one milf, you can bang all her single friends. Gotta do a good job though, and she’s gonna brag about what she’s got, and her friends will want a slice.

Anyways, hope this perspective helps."

From September of 2018 to December 2019 I basically put a total of $1400 in Robinhood if the course of a year in like $300 increments. Problem with this is one bad trade forces you to deposit more money and causes you to spend more in the long run I think. 

I got $3000 from my company for Christmas and basically started fresh in think or swim. Not seeing that chart every day actually makes me feel less impulsive to need to make a trade every day to make that chart go up. Maybe that’s just my personality trait, but so far it’s going really well for me. I’ll never go back to RH"

All free marketing. And its not just the 1% who are going to buy tickets, people making mid 6 figures are going to spend money on it too because it's a once in a life time opportunity.
