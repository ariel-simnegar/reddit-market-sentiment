2020-04-07 08:43:37,Droidvoid,3,With the Fed in the investment grade paper market they‚Äôre incentivizing companies to improve their balance sheets so that they can have access to that market. But improvements to their balance sheet would come in the form of less capital expenditures and a huge cut in labor costs I assume. Both which are negative to the over all economy. Just a thought but I think these are some secondary effects of their stimulus. Seems better to just let the shitty companies fail every so often.

You got to anticipate your plays. You have to have an edge in this market. Either you get there early or you buy calls on a red day expecting a green or buy puts in a Green Day expecting red. 

Anticipate and do not chase. That‚Äôs where the real money rolls in. But it‚Äôs hard cause you have to be a little smart, which as we all know, no one here is. But trust me, little money is made chasing. Start to plan your shit out and start to anticipate moves.

\- Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care.

\- A state needs to be able to test at least everyone who has symptoms.

\- The state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts.

\- There must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

Key point:

>**Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology and law at Yale, said: ‚Äú....The point is, though, that we are nowhere even near accomplishing any of these criteria. Opening up before then will be met with a resurgence of the virus.‚Äù**

Today I received a letter in the mail saying judge says case is valid and company must show up in court.

2020-04-07 03:20:47,Lolsmileyface13,43,"a sad moment of reflection, and something that interestingly I heard news chris cuomo iterate today:

in NY one of the reasons we never hit peak anticipated icu beds is because ppl have been dying so much more rapidly. We ended up enacting comfort care measures so much quicker than anticipated on so many patients as well. It's been rough in that sense - the state anticipated 21+ day courses for many patients, and yet many of them have not made it to 7 days because their course was so violently downhill once in the ICU that us as their physicians and their families decided to forego further intervention. 

It's sad. We train our lives to do just the opposite, to heal, and it's something that I've struggled with. But families have been very supportive. I think while the rest of the country has maybe not yet caught up in terms of numbers and hopefully won't, NY has gone through something terrible and the people understand, and are suffering together. 

One patient I semi-crash intubated in the ICU for hypoxia quickly facetimed his wife to say goodbye just prior to sedation, and told her he'd see her on the the other side in 10 days or so. He even flashed his phone around to show her the team as we prepped to intubate him. He understood his odds, but didn't want her to worry. His final words were that he loved her. A lifelong NY Times staffer who had shared with me some amazing work stories. I'd grown close to him. He passed about a week ago, and as with all my patients I'd called his wife every day to share his status as family couldn't visit patients. The night he was dying I was working, and I called his wife to let her know it wouldn't be long. I found myself more emotional than her, and it turned into her comforting me, a new experience for me. Her and I had really bonded too. She'd even bought food for our medical team. Imagine that! 

10 months out of medical school covid has really shaken me. And while I'm happy it looks like it won't bite as hard as it looked like it would, at least for now, I'm saddened by the lives lost amidst the chaos."

why?

if you were someone with enough money and influence to drive the market one way or another, you would go on TV and cry that hell is coming. this induces panic selling thus we saw multiple limit up/down days after.

after market retraces 20% you let them know this was a trick all along, you made your couple billion and tell them the gig is up you're actually pretty optimistic that the virus will blow over shortly restoring some confidence. people are pissed off that a billionaire would do this but what can you do. as they say fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. 

as people sit on the sidelines to make sure he wasn't lying about the optimism in the market and see multiple green days and retracement over last couple weeks and then today, the big cajone: stocks go up bigly. they rush back into the market picking up any and all stocks and calls they can get because this is a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" to buy cheap stocks still at huge discounts that we know should be trading near ATH! the more they crashed, the better deal it is! companies like $BA who isn't building a thing and airplane cancellations around the corner +20%, $MGM with zero properties open +22%, $CCL +20%, $JWN +25%, and so forth.

WSB starts dumping all their puts and long calls! ""AMERICA IS BACK!"" ""VIRUS DEFEATED"" ""BEARS R FUK"" shouted the autists!

2020-04-06 21:55:22,Eric-,8,The reason the market rallied is because some people saw that the rate of virus growth was lowering in parts of Europe and NYC and incorrectly decided that we are past the worst of it and things must be getting better.  This isn't even close to being over.  Yes social distancing and lock down does lower the spread of the virus but that doesn't mean the economy is going to open up anytime soon.  The economy is not going to reopen unless either the virus is cured or it is 100% contained.  Neither will happen in the next 3 months. What we saw today from the market was an overreaction to hopeful news.

2020-04-06 21:32:10,boon4376,-2,"I switched to calls last week. Doubled down today and invested the rest of my account in on long calls.

The idea that this quarantine is going to impact everyone until the fall is preposterous media hype. At-risk cohorts are being identified by easily testable genetic marker at a rapid pace (like people with high IL-6 being 22x more likely to require a respirator). Drugs for these cohorts have been in clinical trial since early March.

As soon as we have therapeutics approved for the very small percentage of vulnerable people, the death rate drops by an order of magnitude and this becomes less severe than the flu, and quarantine is lifted for all but the identified cohorts. 

Life will get back to normal, except for the bottom of the barrel companies well before stimulus runs out (because the stimulus is essentially unlimited). Recovery will take 3-5x longer than the drop, but your puts will still be worthless and long calls will be printing forever. 

The overall unemployed populations shrink rapidly because of the stimulus, and the fact that companies are hiring people back to get full debt forgiveness."
