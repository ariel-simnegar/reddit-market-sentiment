2019-11-18 02:01:56,zebrawaterfall,3,"On Sept. 9 we hit an ATH on ROKU at 176.55. I think we have an easy $10 difference to make up in the next week at the rate ROKU is growing. The main issues I have with buying calls are 1. they are fucking expensive and 2. we haven't had any sort of dip in a week. 

Those who have played ROKU (broku) before have been victim to the massive swings this stock has. Makes me wonder if it's worth chasing - or if we are being bamboozled.

I think this ROKU will end up being a risky ass play. All the analyst reports on ROKU list them as overbought and a ""sell"" with the most recent reports. They don't know shit to the average WSB'er, of course.

All in all my only theory is that if the market continues doing what it was doing last week, ROKU will continue to go up out of pure market hysteria. If we have any sort of major dip I could see BROKU crashing hard back to a ""normal"" level.
