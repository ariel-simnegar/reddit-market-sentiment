Nothing interesting (still). Just a continued slow grind up in the market. [When we hit resistance this morning](https://imgur.com/w8BxkUR) we wound back down. Without news I expect trading in this range for the rest of the week. Tomorrow's trading range is 320.2 to 317.3, assuming we don't break resistance. We're in the beginnings of a wedge so I expect a bullish break sooner rather than later because of the retard strength of the market.

Since a lot of you guys are fucking with BA, looking at crayons it seems 316 is the support range so I wouldn't yolo too far past that. Historical PPO suggests BA can sell just a bit more from current price, but I would reiterate you'd have to be a real WSBer to go past the price point I mentioned.
