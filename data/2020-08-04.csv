You watch it climb slowly over the next week, but quickly grow bored and stop following stocks after a few days. 


6 months later, you really want a new mattress, so you log onto your account to see if you can sell your shares. You‚Äôre up like 20 bucks in all that time, and decide to never waste your time on stocks ever again. They never move, apparently."

https://twitter.com/Archer83Able/status/1290252852011528195

Iron dome will now have the US produce the entirety of the system, first time ever the whole system can be produced outside of Israel. 

https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/08/israel-iron-dome-manufactured-united-states.html

Wider conflict is looking more and more likely, hard to judge a time frame, but Trump's comments on the explosion being an attack are highly suspect considering the p-8 activity IMO.

Assuming a conflict between hezbollah and israel breaks out unexpectedly, what stocks will be the first to explode up, and the first to shit the bed?

Raytheon has the contract for producing Iron dome, so calls might be good now on them, but IDK what to short.

Under the phase one trade deal, China had pledged to boost purchases of U.S. goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, including agricultural and manufactured products, energy and services.
Given the global coronavirus recession, China is lagging behind its first-year goal of a $77 billion rise in purchases. Imports of farm goods have been lower than the 2017 level, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion.

Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the phase one first year goal of $25.3 billion.

She‚Äôs in her late 40s I guess(i‚Äôm not good at aging women, especially escorts since they‚Äôve been through a lot). And isn‚Äôt really attractive. Every time we switch positions she kept adding lube so by the end of the session I couldn‚Äôt even feel the pussy anymoreüòê. When the session 1st started she took a picture of my dick for some reason. I didn‚Äôt object because it was kind of weird/uncomfortable, but I took it as a compliment.  And I kind of don‚Äôt like how she is enjoying the session a little too damn much. Maybe it‚Äôs just an act, but I‚Äôm the one paying for the pussy, and she‚Äôs over here acting like I gave her the best dick of her life. She should be paying meü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. As I was getting dressed to leave she kept repeating ‚Äúyou numba one‚Äù, ‚Äúnumba one‚Äù while giving me a thumbs up over and over. Idk it just kind of felt weird. I‚Äôm going to give them one more chance to have me see a younger or at least a different woman, or I‚Äôm not coming back to this whorehouse again. I‚Äôve been here six times and I‚Äôve fucked this same old lady three of them.... The only downside to the Asian women are that I‚Äôve heard most are racist and don‚Äôt accept black guys. I told this one I was Dominican over the phone. Before I came here the first time. I hope I can find a different whorehouse with some moderately better women that will let me patronize their establishment."

You stand up and lift a corner of your Purple mattress and find $40: one $10 bill, two $5 bills, and the rest in singles. She rolls her eyes as you triple-check the count on the $1 bills, then she takes the cash and leaves, without a goodbye. Once the door closes behind her, your nose is filled with the stench of what you'd just done. Not for the first time, you regret being unable to afford one of the climate controlled storage units that circulate air.

You absentmindedly walk over to the ironing board where the last of your clothes hang and pull on a stained t-shirt. It's still a bit damp. Because you can't afford the laundromat, you've been sneaking into the park at night and handwashing your clothes in a stream. Last night, a couple of kids who were smoking weed had stumbled upon you, and your head and heart had filled with their confused laughter as you ran away.

You look again at the only other thing in this storage unit, your mattress, and you can taste the toxic poison of regret in your mouth as you remember what got you into this position. Arrogance and calls. Blind conviction that a mattress company was stronger than a global recession. You lost everything, but out of pity, your now-ex-wife told the judge that you could see your kids on some weekends. But you haven't exercised the privilege once in months. Not since you moved into here. You couldn't survive the anguish if they found out--if they knew their father washes his clothes in a stream at night, when no one can see him."

2020-08-04 22:52:55,tendeeznuts,10," **Could the Fed Become Insolvent?** 

>While the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet has ballooned to roughly $7 trillion, its capital base has remained constant at about $39 billion. With this leverage ratio of roughly 175-to-1 (Figure 11), it seems plausible that a loss could wipe out the Fed‚Äôs relatively meager capital buffer and leave it with a negative net worth. Although this is possible, things may not be as worrisome as this figure suggests. The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet is largely comprised of assets with relatively minimal credit risk. While the Fed is adding new, riskier assets to its balance sheet through its crisis lending facilities, the Treasury has seeded these facilities with capital that can help protect the Fed from some default risk. Even if the Fed were to become technically insolvent, the consequences are much more likely to be political rather than economic.

>I‚Äôm convinced half this sub doesn‚Äôt do any research before making plays. If You had done any research whatsoever, you would have found out the Nikola is projecting 300k revenue for earnings. You would also realize that the reason nkla is running up a bit is because they will probably be announcing some major news in the call, such as partnership to produce the badger, and/or actual statement of the pre order for badger. Or something along those lines.  
>  
>But nah. Just buy your puts thinking the stock will tank if they report 200k instead of 300k.

NKLA actual revenue: $30k

Loss: $81million

Cars produced: 0
