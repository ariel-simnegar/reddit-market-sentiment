**A family of four in Wuhan all passed away due to the virus. Translation of the husbands final words: [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f535md/a_family_of_four_in_wuhan_all_passed_away_due_to/)**

Chang Kai, 55 years old, a director in Hubei, he spent his career in preserving traditional Chinese opera. His father passed away at the third day of Chinese New Year, his mother passed away six days, him and his sister both passed away in Feb 14.

His wife is also infected, so far her condition is ok.

His son is studying in UK currently.

I am not a professional translator, but I think people should read about his last words. How many tragedies we don‚Äôt know? The death of Chinese people is not just a number.

Director Chang Kai worte beautifully in the classic Chinese style so I can only translate the meaning of them.

Translation:

At Chinese New Year‚Äòs eve, I cancelled dinner reservation at a fancy hotel according to public policies.

I cooked a dinner at home my wife and our parents, we all had a great time.

Little did I know, a nightmare has arrived. First day of new year, my old man was having a fever with coughing, he had trouble breathing. Too him to mutiple hospitals and was told there's no vacancy, no matter how hard we tried to get help, we still couldnt get my dad into a hospital.

We were disappointed, we went home. Couple days later, there's nothing we could do, my father passed away in a not peaceful way. Under such tragedy, my mom‚Äòs mind and body, she was infected too and passed away not long after.

While talking care of my parents, the virus also infected me and my wife. We went to many hospitals, asking begging for treatments, yet we are just nobody. Now our conditions are severe, we‚Äòve missed the best time to get treatments.

Now I am at my last breath, I want to tell my friends and my son in UK: in my whole life, I‚Äòve been a good son, a responsible father and a loving husband, I am an honest man! Goodbye, to those who love me and the ones I love."
