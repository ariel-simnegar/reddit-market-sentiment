They are now starting to put inv storage restrictions on sellers who dont meet certain thresholds and performance. Based on sell through rate, inventory age etc.  

So amazon charges monthly storage fees, then every 6 months they have a long term storage fee they add on top of the regular. So this leads me to believe that Amazon is either concerned about space availability, or they are just tied of being used a storage facility for low turn over products. 

Space concern would be an issue. If it's just to limit the amount of ""trash"" in their storage, it's a non issue"

This was a $115 company BEFORE Disney + and Fox acquisition.  Disney + additive value in my calculations is as follows:
Netflix market cap $140b
Netflix users 158m
Easy calculation, every 15.8m Disney + subscribers are worth an additional $14b in market cap.  Even though Disney doesn’t charge as much as Netflix, Disney content is largely bought and paid for.  I suspect Disney will have 60m users by end of 2020, that’s an additional $56B in market cap.  That’s a $160 stock by end of 2020."

Check out this excerpt:

“With commission-free trading now the norm, e-brokers must find new ways to attract clients who might boost other parts of the business—such as banking or financial advice—and who could become more lucrative as their investments grow.

Schwab’s move would be the first by a major online brokerage to allow investors to buy and sell fractions of stocks. Some of the most well-known and popular companies have high price tags, making owning a share impossible for some would-be investors. A share of Amazon.com Inc., for example, costs around $1,794.

In addition, fractional shares can help younger and less-wealthy investors diversify their investment portfolios by spreading relatively small pots of money over a broader range of stocks.

“It’s about widening the net,” said Richard Repetto, a brokerage analyst at Sandler O’Neill + Partners LP. Allowing clients to own slivers of companies reflects Schwab’s emphasis on bringing in new customers that can develop into more profitable accounts over time, Mr. Repetto said.”

From MarketWatch

> The U.S. trade representative's office confirmed late Thursday that tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods will take effect Friday. Aircraft produced in the EU will be slapped with 10% tariffs, while other products, such as cheese and whisky, will be slapped with 25% tariffs. The Trump administration announced the move earlier this month after the World Trade Organization ruled the U.S. could impose tariffs in retaliation for illegal preferential treatment by the EU for aircraft maker Airbus SA. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. could not lose a trade war with Europe because of the large trade imbalance that exists. ""I can remedy the situation very easily,"" Trump said."

2019-10-17 21:08:09,ProOrlando,8," We have been having some very unusual market activity since the beginning of August. Crazy moves in 5-10 day periods. 2-3 sigma moves both up and down. Just look at the last 8 trading sessions. SPY $285 to $300 in a straight line, TLT $146 to $139 straight down, VIX down over 40% in 8 sessions… It’s the steepness of these moves that are concerning. The plunge straight down and the rip straight up. This is not a healthy market in the slightest. Something has to give because the market can’t keep living in this volatility bubble for much longer."
