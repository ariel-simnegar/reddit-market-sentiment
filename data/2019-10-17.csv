They are now starting to put inv storage restrictions on sellers who dont meet certain thresholds and performance. Based on sell through rate, inventory age etc.  

So amazon charges monthly storage fees, then every 6 months they have a long term storage fee they add on top of the regular. So this leads me to believe that Amazon is either concerned about space availability, or they are just tied of being used a storage facility for low turn over products. 

Space concern would be an issue. If it's just to limit the amount of ""trash"" in their storage, it's a non issue"
