Economic data is signalling fast turnarounds as well. Both haven't rallied as hard as US equities either (probably because not as popular with retail investors). For eg. S&P 500 is about 3.6% off highs, EU5 is about 8% off highs, UK(ftse 100) is about 20% off highs. Alot more upside and positive news coming from EU5/UK. Those are the best value plays right now."

Would be cool to see all the major automotive manufacturers and a government commission come together and create a competent and real plan on how we could optimize our roadways for self driving vehicles. Like say mixing certain reflective material into all future road paint to make the lines more easily detectable by infrared cameras for autopilot. Putting standard sensors in stop signs and other street signs that tell the car what to do. Sensors at intersections that tell it how to react. Sensors in speed limit signs so the car can automatically adjust speed and so on.

Idk I'm just throwing shit at the wall, but I think autonomous driving will only ever get so good without a real investment into making roads an autonomous friendly environment. Reading data based on partially obstructed or worn signage and rundown roads where the lines have wiped away into virtually nothing is asking for disaster. 

That being said the US can't stop it's existing roads from crumbling into dust so I'm not sure something like this would ever happen.

2020-07-14 02:52:53,ThePeoplesBard,8,"**An excerpt from my upcoming novel for gay Bears, *50 Shades of Red*:**

Our romance popped like a bubble. We had floated through the air together, magically and invisibly. Then in an instant, it was all over. Perhaps all affairs end suddenly? I wasn't sure, as this was my first.

I remembered our last conversation vividly. Painfully.

""We can't keep getting away with this."" I gently wiped the sweat away from his forehead, his silver hair brushing the back of my fingers. ""Elissa won't find out,"" I replied. 

At my words he blinked and frowned slightly, ""No, I mean this tech surge."" What a fool I had been for assuming he was worried about our love.

He then stood, and his naked body went rigid. ""It's too much. Too fast. Investors have their heads in the clouds with these cloud stocks."" He grew louder, and his ass muscles flexed. ""They don't even know what the cloud is!"" 

""And EV. EV! Fred Flintstone had a better looking car! Hot Wheels have generated more revenue! I begged him to help slow the feverish buying--to pump the brakes--but his Tweet wasn't enough...""

If you don't and take the product listing down, you will have to fill all the forms later to post them back up, which is highly time consuming and annoying (like filling forms for job applications), especially if you have more than a couple hundred listings on a website.

So I was $9.6k up at 8am pacific 

Put my phone down and went mountain biking. Got a flat and flipped over my bars into some prickly stuff. Face first mind you. 

I then had to walk my bike like 6 miles and 1200 ft of elevation. A guy rode by with a co2 canister and got my tire back in action. Rode back the last few miles but took a new route, mountain was crazy steep but downhill was fun.

Got back to my car

I was at like $3k in profits. 

Ok let it ride

Sold everything as it was tanking at $1.5k up

Bought another amazon call as it skyrocketed. Then immediately down $3k

Sold to keep from slipping into negative town.

Bought an amazon put as the bear flag was strong

Sold for $2k profit but should have held as it ranked another $70.

Saw the big bear flag on Tesla so I bought a put. It immediately jumped up $25 dollars. Down -$2k

Bought something else and made some money, I forget. 

Ended the day -$986

Really should sell in the morning and take profits and buy end of day. Idk what I was thinking"

2020-07-13 23:38:00,CptTonyStark,12,"Here are some of the handicaps mutual fund managers and other professional investors are saddles with:

1.	With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate towards the biggest stocks thus they end up owning the same few overpriced giants.
2.	Investors pour more money into funds as market rises, so the fund managers use the new cash to buy more stocks they already hold thus bubbling prices up.
3.	When market goes down, ppl pull money from the funds, forcing them to sell their holdings and depressing stock prices too much.
4.	Portfolio managers get bonuses based on beating S&P 500 so if a company is added to an index, hundreds of funds will compulsively buy it. If they don't and the company does well, the managers look foolish but if it does poorly, no one will blame them.
5.	Funds are forced to specialize into categories like small growth stocks, mid sized value stocks, etc. and if a company moves between categories, the fund managers are forced to buy/sell it.

So there's no reason you can't do as well as the ""pros"" ü§°ü§°ü§°"

2020-07-13 23:15:22,savekickass,18,"Look, I was and am a gay bear since February. I was one of the many bears who made large gains during the initial crash and then lost most of it by bag holding puts.

I loved this rush, I loved the instant gratification of making money and the stress, the fear, the memes etc... it‚Äôs perfect for my adhd brain. So, I started to look into it more, doing more research, reading books, creating a trading strategy and so on. But every where I looked, the universe told me to not trade against the trend. Do not be bearish when the market only goes up.

Even then, there was nothing out there that could convince me to be bullish on anything. Every time I bought a call, I got anxious because I know that at any moment in time, the market can and will crash (based on my logic). This would mean that I have to set all my logic aside, go against my gut feeling, and basically gamble even though the odds may be in my favor.

To convert me to a bull, would be like saying gay conversion therapy works.

So I gave up trying to convince myself to be a bull, and instead only follow one rule; cut my losses.

Thankfully, we are in a kangaroo market. In this market, it is easy to make money regardless if you are a bull or bear (at least on SPY). That is assuming you have a basic understanding of the fundamentals and technicals of the stock market. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say I have even the basics down yet, but I am back to being green. The number one change I made was by minimizing my losses.

At any moment that I am in a trade and I begin to doubt that it will continue going down or that I will profit off it, I get out. On the contrary, if I am in profit, no matter how much, if I think it will continue going lower I keep holding. If I am on the fence, that‚Äôs when I stick to my original stop loss/ take profit area. I also never get into a trade without setting exit points.

Of course, trying to time the entries and figuring out a good stop loss area is more complicated. But even if you set up arbitrary exits, you will never blow your account to 0(at least not as fast) if you cut losses. This will give you more time to stay solvent as you keep learning and perfecting your trading strategy.

Also, I never doubt my own outlooks on the market just because someone tells me I am wrong. I do take in consideration of the others argument and research it accordingly, but I never trade based on what people tell me. It is easier said than done, but I still am a gay bear because there is no way I can justify SPY going to ATH.

If SPY goes to ATH, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but I can‚Äôt justify that price. Yes I am pretty much trying to time the crash, but the market is a kangaroo one even if it trending up for the most part so I still profit off the dips using this method.

Thanks for listening to my Ted talk.

TLDR: SPY 08/10 300p"

Coming to terms with losing 8k today. At the peak, NASDAQ was up 1.91%. I thought the rally had momentum. You don't gain that much without substantial force behind. I believe the sell off was partly artificially induced. Trump and his lackeys started a fight with the Chinese again just like the start of the trade war. It's not my fault. On any other day, that 8k would have been secured.

Trade price was $6.00. Mark is now $6.55. P/L is ($55). The underlying (BA) was $175.93 at time of trade, but the ask is now $177.40.

1) I have to assume that because the underlying has increased in value since the trade was entered, the put option has become less valuable by $0.55, resulting in a real-time/short-term loss. 

2) If that's true, if the underlying fell close to $150, would the put option would become more valuable, resulting in a positive P/L in TOS? 

3) Ultimately, because I plan on holding through expiration to collect the full premium, can I just ignore these short-term P/Ls?"

Mistakes are there to learn from.  You are loved and priceless, I promise you.  This isn't too much for you to recover from.

Please get advice or council if you need help.  If you think you have nobody, I am here for you and I know others here are, too.  I am happy to love you and give you time and listen.

Take a break tonight and be ready to patiently and slowly recover."

2020-07-13 20:44:05,AngelofDisease,12," I've said this before, but today seems like an especially poignant example.

I've been reading these ""Corona is cancelled"" and ""no one cares about the virus anymore"" posts for weeks. Listen retards, I know ""priced in"" is a meme, but this is a PSA for anyone who actually believes that anything is priced in - it rarely is. The market was fucking MOONING all through the first 2 MONTHS of grim pandemic news at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until the last possible second that the market reacted to it and the crash was monstrous.

2021 isn't priced in. Future profits aren't priced in. Second wave isn't priced in. Trump winning or losing the election isn't priced in. ZM is at P/E 2500+ and Hertz flew up hundreds of percent after catastrophic bankruptcy news. If you trade based on ""priced in,"" prepare to get fucked. If you think the market won't eventually care about catastrophic Covid numbers, you're going to get fucked. If you trade like the market has to care about those numbers right now, you're going to get fucked. If you want to make money, just think like you're a short-sighted retard and don't be the last guy holding the bag"

Average debt per small business: $195,000+ (according to Experian, 2016)  


So even before the pandemic, everything was over leveraged. The American economy is based on borrowing large sums of money, and having a constant revenue stream in order to make payments on that debt. The shutdowns (and the coming re-shutdowns) interrupted those income streams, making it impossible for individuals and businesses to pay their bills. Even the most smartly run small businesses are finding that they simply can't afford to be closed for more than a couple months, and that the only way out of the situation is to close permanently.

So she really wanted to start ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù so she was thinking of making out cash advances from her cards. When pressed about how she came up with this idea, she said she was so happy. Her son used to deal drugs, but quit in April to become an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù and he‚Äôs made more since April than he ever did with Drugs, so he stopped dealing to pursue ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù full time.
