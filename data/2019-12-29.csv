Pton looks like it's about to reverse. I doubt there will be a short squeeze anytime soon, but I see a nice bounce to 30 this week.

Ebay if it can break 36.50 and hold it will most likely fill the gap. Twtr currently filling the gap.

Still not sure what roku wants to do. I see it going lower but I can be wrong."

2019-12-29 21:45:21,TUGBOATCHAMPION,36,"I decided to go to disneyland over the holidays to scout out some fine DD for the folks here at WSB. Kids and wife came along too.
When I was standing in line, I heard someone loudly utter ahead of me in a bit of a scoffish tone, ""I'm only here to get a picture with a millennium vaccuum"".
Letting everyone around him know that he was too much of an adult to enjoy winnie the pooh, the kind of latent insecurity only a true man-child could display.

Now, bear in mind, this looked exactly like the kind of guy you would expect to say something like that. Mid 20's, receding hairline, big piggy belly,
acne, awful ungroomed upper liphair which I assume he calls a mustache. What we had here was the work of millions of years of evolution fending off aggressors, 
foraging, surviving, procreating, and rearing offspring to come to an abrupt dead end as a white stain on an anime body pillow. 

That's when it hit me, the brilliance of the mouse. You see, other companies are concerned about the audience of their market. 
What is their market penetration among latinos, chinese, the 12-18 age group, etc. 

The Disney theme parks are far beyond having to worry about that. That's because every man knows when
he takes off the rubber because ""it just feels better"", and that spermatozoa hits the egg, there is the unescapable truth that he will walking
through those gates at sometime in his future no matter his race. 
From the mouse's perspective, it's already priced in. His small ""whoopsie"" is included in the 2030 revenue forecase.

The only ones capable of escaping this inevitability are those who have no possibility of ever producing off-spring. 
The lucasfilm acquisition was a strategic penetration into the virgin market, the last untapped source of revenue growth.


TL;DR
No one escapes the mouse. Long acquisition targets for the man-child market ($R&M, $WHO, $PONY)"
