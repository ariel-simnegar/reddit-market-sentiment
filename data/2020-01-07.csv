>**There's a growing narrative that the form of the Iran retaliation was the ""best"" possible outcome for markets and a major risk-positive**. Since last Friday, markets have been fearing the next stage of escalation and how we can possibly move beyond this event. That has resulted in a necessary added risk-premium -- and suddenly, there may be a reason for it to be removed. Iran's public and self-claimed attack on U.S.-Iraq bases, that have resulted in no reported casualties, is being portrayed as the ultimate ""thread the needle"" move, in terms of appeasing domestic demands for revenge but not compelling the U.S. to respond again. To be clear, MLIV is not positioned to provide any extra insight on whether this narrative will ultimately be correct, but we can see it being the dominant market one until proven otherwise"

-AM volatility will be insane, lots of fear likely

-Futures are down but it’s not weekend dow so who cares 

-Trump will tell us about Alliswell.exe in the morning and probably curtail volatility. Maybe it will be premarket. If he escalates (unlikely if troops were not killed), the bears will win bigly.

-BA will drop on news of the crash and maybe bounce back when it becomes clear that it was probably simply a horrible mistake and nothing to do with them

-Iran is not likely to attack us because (1) alliswell and (2) clearly if they tried they’d be just as likely to hit themselves with their missiles. Counterpoint: they look like complete idiots right now after what looked like a big face saving ruse so who knows.

-Probably missing some things.

""What we've seen in Iran        in the past few years is a change from missiles that were mainly        political or psychological tools to actual battlefield weapons. This is        a quantum change,"" the Post quoted Fabian Hinz,        who works at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies        in MonteSHYrey, Calif, as saying.

The Post continued: The result is a line of short- and        medium-range missiles that can deliver warheads with an accuracy range        in the tens of meters, a Defense Department intelligence        official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to        discuss sensitive assessments of Iran's        military capability.

Back in the 1980s, Iran's        most sophisticated ballistic weaponry consisted of versions of Cold        War-era Scud missiles developed by the former Soviet        Union,            which offered a limited range and low accuracy. It also has used        ballistic technologies from China        and North Korea,        according to reports. However, U.S.-led        sanctions have hampered its efforts somewhat.

**Iran currently has what is described as one of the largest        arsenals of ballistic missiles in the world, which can strike targets up        to 1,250 miles away, but haven't always been on target.**

**That may have changed.**"

The video clearly shows it was on fire at a few thousand feet.

Considering the history of accidentally shooting down planes in war zones and well us in 1980s Iran I’m going to say it was definitely accidentally shot down.

This is extremely fucked up.  Imagine minding your business and a 15 seconds later your dead. Didn’t blow up but slowly crashed while on fire - it’s the thing of nightmares.

- the flight tracker is showing the plane still flying (or was, per some peoples comments) 
- pics of crash site came out, not much plane left

So what if the plane did get shot down in the early morning by Iran, right around the time of their strike.

2020-01-08 03:33:52,TiredOfDebates,4,"Iran is seeking to gain control over Iraq.

Iraq is actually really cool with this idea.

Iran will attack American forces in Iraq, with the goal of causing enough damage to make the occupation politically impossible.  We simply can't handle thousands of US combat casualties.  Americans don't have the appetite for it.

I'm not talking about ""America leaving Iraq, leaving a couple bases behind, and a 'training force'"".  I'm talking, Iran plans to force the US out of Iraq, at the end of a gun.  This is MORE IMPORTANT for strategic purposes (the reputation that Iran gets) than out of operational necessity.  Iran will be seen in Iraq as a rescuer.  They will honestly be hailed as liberators.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hussein was Sunni.  The USA invaded Iraq, and executed Hussein.  The Shia Muslims that Hussein brutally repressed took over in this power vacuum.  Now, in the present day, Iraq's government is ruled by Shia.

IRAN, is dominated by Shia Islam.  Those people that we are now fighting with.

Remember now... 10 to 20% of the world's Muslims are Shia.  Internationally, they're a minority.  This creates a unique bond between Iraq and Iran.  A unique bond that American popular culture just doesn't even fathom the possibility of.  Like... Iran?  That nation that is going to nuke us or something?  Aren't they EVIL?  And the Iraqi Government, they LOVE US, because of all that the US has done for Iraq.  Right, that's how this works right?"

2020-01-08 03:00:51,Dynoblaze,-10,"War. War is good. I love War. I love Holocausts. I love Blitzkriegs. I love defensive lines. I love sieges. Charges. I love mop-up operations and retreats. 
Wars across prairies, in streets, in trenches, in grasslands, in frozen tundras, through deserts, on the sea, in the air. I love every act of war that can occur upon this earth! 

I love blasting the enemy to smithereens with artillery salvos that thunder across the lines of battle. 
My heart leaps with joy whenever a soldier is tossed high into the air and cut to pieces by well placed sniper rounds! 
And there is nothing like a tank operator using a Tiger Acht-Acht to destroy enemy tanks. 
And the feeling that comes when a soldier runs screaming from his blazing tank only to be mowed down by heavy machine gun fire is such an exquisite feeling. 

Like when ranks of infantry brandish their bayonets rushing into the enemy line. 
It moves me deep within my heart to watch a fresh recruit stabbing over and over into the bloated chest of a long-dead enemy. 

The sight of deserters being strung up from a street lamp is an irresistible pleasure. 
Und there is nothing more arousing than the sounds made by prisoners of war dropping like flies, screaming in agony as they're mowed down by ear piercing Schmeissers! 

When a band of pitiful resistance fighters makes their final stand with nothing but small arms, only to have their city smashed to atoms block by block by 4.8 ton bombshells, I'm in ecstasy. 

I love it when my forces are ravaged by a Russian armored division. It's so sad to see towns and villages that were supposed to be defended at all costs, being laid to waste, their women and children being raped and killed. 
I love to be squashed under the heel of the British and American war machines. The humiliation as my men crawl around like vermin, ducking the JAG bombers flying overhead. 

Gentlemen... all I ask for is war. A war so grand as to make Hell itself tremble. 
Gentlemen, I ask you as fellow brothers in arms, what is it that you really want? 
Do you wish for further war as I do? 
Do you wish for a merciless, bloody war? A war whose fury is built with iron, and lightning, and fire? 
Do you ask for war to sweep in like a tempest, leaving not even ravens to scavenge from this Earth!?"

I think some level of pushback was expected and as long as these people didn't cross a line they might call it ""even"".

No update today or significant movement. We are still trading in the weird consolidation range that has started to form that [I mentioned yesterday:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eksot6/daily_discussion_thread_january_06_2020/fdeak81/) 319.5-323.8. Looking at the charts I expect similar ranges and flatish trading tomorrow as well barring any overnight news. Nothing interesting on the economic calendar either until Friday.

If we spiral down, 319.5 is a strong support because we have not yet properly challenged it recently. Unless we gap past it I don't expect any breaks below it without some stabilization in that range.

Best of luck to you all tomorrow and get those tendies."
