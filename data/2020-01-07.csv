>**There's a growing narrative that the form of the Iran retaliation was the ""best"" possible outcome for markets and a major risk-positive**. Since last Friday, markets have been fearing the next stage of escalation and how we can possibly move beyond this event. That has resulted in a necessary added risk-premium -- and suddenly, there may be a reason for it to be removed. Iran's public and self-claimed attack on U.S.-Iraq bases, that have resulted in no reported casualties, is being portrayed as the ultimate ""thread the needle"" move, in terms of appeasing domestic demands for revenge but not compelling the U.S. to respond again. To be clear, MLIV is not positioned to provide any extra insight on whether this narrative will ultimately be correct, but we can see it being the dominant market one until proven otherwise"

I imagine some big money is pumping futures so they can sell at open. It’ll take days to realize the implications of Iran’s actions, and things could escalate over the weekend, so if you’re going puts consider making a weekend play soon."

Whats the latest news?

 Iran trying to save face by talking about 80 casualties, even though there were probably none?
