2020-06-12 11:00:06,phabphour20,9,"To all of you bulls out there, please be careful today.  Don't buy short dates or far OOTM strikes.  

Sell your calls on open (if we stay elevated like this) and wait an hour to see which way things are going to go.  Who cares if you miss 50 bps or even 1% in the grand scheme of things?  The flip side is that you could be quickly cleaned out of your 6/19 calls on a 3% drop.

Yesterday was so damn ugly there will be residual fear and if there are some sellers, things could get red again fast.

I have nothing against you bulls and I want to help.  I'm not saying go short.  I'm not saying don't buy calls.  I'm just saying don't buy dumb calls and maybe wait an hour to see if we are going to get raped again before you buy.

That is all."

2020-06-12 10:34:47,morten_tor,2,"Today we will erase the drop from yesterday and then some.

Why: if you have to ask ""why"" you aren't paying attention.

Dips are always and everywhere a buying opportunity.

There will be some statement from Powell later today that he was ""misunderstood"", and that they are pondering buying SPY to support the struggling worker.

We're immune to the vaccine announcements (shouldn't we have one by now?), so that's priced in. And even if we don't get a vaccine, the mentality is that only frail old people die of this thing. 

The violent dips are normal in a market based on bubble boys circle-trading. Just as we see wild jumps in a bear market panic.

The fundamentals are worse than you can possibly imagine. Someone lent Hertz 1.5 billion dollars. Why in the hell would you do that? That's like lending your gardener half a million bucks. You can tell your wife that the money is safe, because the gardener is paying his dues - except he is paying those dues with new loans you just gave him. Then you can tell your buddies that your 500K loan to the gardener was a genius move, as it yields 10% ""risk free"". If you're clever, you make your friend take over the loan. This happens quite a lot as gullible moronic fund managers who ate boogers in 4th grade are tempted by the huge spread.

But for now, the bubble lives."
