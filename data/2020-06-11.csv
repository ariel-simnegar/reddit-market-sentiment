Sell your calls on open (if we stay elevated like this) and wait an hour to see which way things are going to go.  Who cares if you miss 50 bps or even 1% in the grand scheme of things?  The flip side is that you could be quickly cleaned out of your 6/19 calls on a 3% drop.

Yesterday was so damn ugly there will be residual fear and if there are some sellers, things could get red again fast.

I have nothing against you bulls and I want to help.  I'm not saying go short.  I'm not saying don't buy calls.  I'm just saying don't buy dumb calls and maybe wait an hour to see if we are going to get raped again before you buy.

That is all."

Why: if you have to ask ""why"" you aren't paying attention.

Dips are always and everywhere a buying opportunity.

There will be some statement from Powell later today that he was ""misunderstood"", and that they are pondering buying SPY to support the struggling worker.

We're immune to the vaccine announcements (shouldn't we have one by now?), so that's priced in. And even if we don't get a vaccine, the mentality is that only frail old people die of this thing. 

The violent dips are normal in a market based on bubble boys circle-trading. Just as we see wild jumps in a bear market panic.

The fundamentals are worse than you can possibly imagine. Someone lent Hertz 1.5 billion dollars. Why in the hell would you do that? That's like lending your gardener half a million bucks. You can tell your wife that the money is safe, because the gardener is paying his dues - except he is paying those dues with new loans you just gave him. Then you can tell your buddies that your 500K loan to the gardener was a genius move, as it yields 10% ""risk free"". If you're clever, you make your friend take over the loan. This happens quite a lot as gullible moronic fund managers who ate boogers in 4th grade are tempted by the huge spread.

But for now, the bubble lives."

1. Vaccine for virus is much further along than in March
2. More people have antibodies for the virus 
3. It's mostly been young people who've been out because of protests (WHO states they're less susceptible, more asymptomatic, and much less likely to spread to others)
4. Economy isn't under the same pressure to close down to prevent the spread of a potential second outbreak

Much less unknowns as more research as been done on the virus. Genomic studies through phylogenetic sequencing has shown this virus has lower mutation rates than say influenza. In other words, the chances of a vaccine being approved are much higher and more likely to be distributed sooner than later."

Even JPow said, you need to price in risks but you still chase these companies. Yesterday was just to eliminate retails over bankrupt companies but you still didn't get the memo it seems.

Here's how you are doing it:

There is almost an unlimited amount of potential cash and buyers, but the amount of shares available to be sold is limited. Traders who think a stock price is too high and are not owners of that stock, can sell the stock short by having their broker borrow shares. The problem is that whoever loaned the shares may want them back at some point in the future and the broker for the short seller has to find a replacement for those shares.

When brokers for those who have already sold a stock short can not find shares to maintain the short position, they do a ""buy-in"" of the stock to close out the short position."

2020-06-12 06:15:30,trump_sucks_we_know,3,"International markets tumbled, tracking a steep U.S. selloff, on concerns that a resurgence in coronavirus infections could hold back economic recovery.

However, U.S. stock futures rose and bond prices fell, suggesting the drawdown might not extend much further, and some market participants said a pullback had been overdue after the recent robust rally.

[...]

Ken Peng, head of Asia investment strategy at Citi Private Bank, said the stance of Federal Reserve and its counterparts represented a major support for markets.

""There's just too much cash sitting around for this to be a deep correction,"" he said. ""The Fed and other major central banks have already made it very clear they're there to buy the bottom basically,"" he said. In addition, Mr. Peng said any resurgence in infections was unlikely to lead to the same widespread shutdowns seen before."

http://imgur.com/gallery/QeINCYy

I didn't feel like filming everywhere to prove my point further, but Kroger's cheaper products are being bought at way higher rates all throughout the store. Maybe you don't have Kroger on shelves where you live, but I can attest I've been buying Kroger everything for a while, and now it seems everyone wants the Kroger brand products. What do you choose between $3.49 coffee mate creamer or $1.99 Kroger coffee creamer? Suddenly in a pandemic and on unemployment, the $KR shit looks a lot better. And their products are good quality too, that's why everyone's buying their shit now more than ever. 

There's a reason $KR  was one of only 4 S&P500 stonks to actually go up today like stonks are supposed to. I'm large on $KR through upcoming earnings report June 18. Had the following calls before today, held them, and plan to add more tomorrow:

The consequences of the actions the fed and other monetary programs have become apparent during JPows speech. They don't care of overvaluations. They don't care about inflation which is higher than the ""under 2%"" he states. They don't care about how much it cost. They only wanted to prop this thing up as long as possible before the real economic numbers start showing up (which they are for other countries). Prop it up long enough to blame something else, the protests? wave 2? improper reopening? China? Something to take the blame away and give them a reason for the crash. But they chose to inject all they can to either keep the big boys happy, to save face, to cash out, or all of  the above. We may not hit 220 but this bitch will go lower."

If there is a second or, god forbid, a third leg down before November, trump loses in a landslide. Biden won’t even have to show up. Biden finger bang tara reade on live television and pick up underage girls with Roy Moore. Won’t matter. If the market goes down so does trump. 

But, if there is no second or third leg down. Either before November or ever again - trump wins against sleepy joe 538-0. Could there be more days like today? Sure. But as long as stonks only go up trump wins every time. 

Me? I’m betting stonks are only going up. At least until after the election."

I had a friend named Charles

Every morning, Charles had a routine

He would take off his shirt then climb on the biggest tallest table in the room. It was the first thing he did every morning

Then, he would just start jumping and screaming, at the top of his lungs, which signaled the rest of us to follow

What a rush, and don't get me started on the pageantry!

As Charles jumped and screamed, the rest us ran to our cot and became ghosts, grabbing pillow covers and ribbon wizard wands to put a spell on Charles, making him scream and jump louder

We loved it, Charles loved it

Especially when we slapped him with the ribbon wands. They were silk, and he loved how they felt on his skin

He would jump, then we would slap, chanting

""Charlie brown, get down!""

That one phrase, over and over, it was a blast. Best yet, the more excited Charles got, the louder and higher he jumped

And then we were all told to stop, immediately, no warning at all; and everyone -- including Charles -- threw a fit. The daycare even called his mom

Come to find...

At a time when there are a lot of new investors still learning, the last thing a network should be doing is laughing at them on fucking TV.

I read in a poker book something that stuck with me. Don't ever be rude, or challenging to the Fish at the table. He might suck, but he's playing for fun, and when you take the fun away, he leaves.

They keep this up, and ""Retail"" might just start pulling all their money causing a real painful correction.

The bond market will eventually be impacted the fed will freak the fuck out will print tons of money stocks will rebound shortly there after gold will have a nice run miners will have a nice run then we will get to the fall we will repeat this cycle most likely (due to second wave fears if the coronavirus is really that bad) and by this time next year trust in currencies will start to evaporate or will already be well into that process stocks will rise in nominal terms but fall in real terms stocks that have leverage to commodities will do great look at the energy sector base metal sector silver miners they will probably go on a multi year run beating inflation if it gets that bad. Prices will go up people are going to be fucking pissed the millennials have already been raped by wallstreet thats why most of you are here gambling to try and get ahead. The democrats will win because communism socialist movements will spring up in most insolvent countries if you can comfortably get out of an insolvent country to one that isnt insolvent well do that..... 

TLDR: Everyone is fucked governments go socialist inflation goes up corporate and fiscal debt bubble leads to more and more QE with diminishing returns commodities are the best bet....."

The Future. 

We bet on futures which are an exchange of money. A very wealthy person has a lot of money. A lot of future. You say to A poor dude. You have no future. 

Money = Future.

Ironically the Future is a concept. It doesn’t exist. Coincidentally, speculative money dwarfs real money which you might say represents the overemphasis on money and the future and a lack of awareness or appreciation of the present moment.

""Hertz Proposes $1 Billion Stock Sale to Capitalize on Odd Rally""

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/hertz-proposes-1-billion-stock-sale-to-capitalize-on-odd-rally 

> Hertz Global Holdings Inc. is asking a bankruptcy judge to let it take advantage of the quixotic surge in its stock by selling up to $1 billion of new shares.
> 
> Stocks of bankrupt companies typically get wiped out, but after an enormous two-week rally, the car rental giant envisions offering as many as 246.78 million common shares with help from Jefferies LLC, according to a court filing. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for Friday to consider the idea.
> 
> Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.
> 
> Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 cents on May 26 to $5.53 on Monday, according to the filing. While the stock has slid to less than half that level, Hertz said a sale of its unissued shares still could help cover its debts.
> 
> “The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.
> 
> A share offering would avoid new interest, fees and restrictions on Hertz’s finances and wouldn’t impose any claims from a bankruptcy loan that would outrank existing creditors, the company said.
> 
> Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers “the common stock could ultimately be worthless.”
> 
> Lawyers asked for an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Indeed, the shares had fallen to $2.06 by the end of Thursday’s session, cutting Hertz’s potential windfall closer to half a billion dollars."

2020-06-12 02:01:49,Blackneutron,15,"Don’t you guys realize that being .8% up on futures isn’t of any significance after a -5% day? Hell, we would sometimes be that up on futures after -1% days and wake up to find it red in the morning. Idk if that makes perfect sense or not but I have a feeling that the future-stock patterns and proportions we are used to don’t  apply here since volatility is much higher now. Btw you can look at the futures chart yourself and you’ll see that this .+8% looks very insignificant compared to the 5% drop we had. It looks like a mere correction in the middle of a big trend. I don’t think anyone in their right mind trading futures right now would look at the chart and just decide it looks bullish."

So CVS WMT and Walgreens were locking up specific beauty and hair products because, statistically, they had a much greater chance of being stolen than other products. Pretty standard business practice, right? 

Except since the products they had to lock up are marketed towards black women, all of a sudden that is “discrimination” and social media had some firestorm that has now resulted in those massive companies unlocking all those items so they are “equal” with the other products in their stores.

2020-06-12 01:32:19,khanx290,14,Big difference between you gamblers and investors is that investors want dip to buy as they have cash sitting idle. You guys want market to just go up as most of you hold calls even though calls are priced in to be expensive. Stock goes up also almost every month and then still you lose money. When stock does not rise as much it should to make you itm you lose 50 percent and then when dip happens you lose everything u had and on the dip investors buy and use up there cash. When market rise very fast you guys jump in late and then investors sell and you remain bag holding. Told you to sell nkla at 94 and you were buying calls on it. Valuation does not make sense to you. Reason we are not in actual casino is that there is still some valuation here but you still treat stocks as game or roulette. I am not saying dont lose money. All I am saying is dont give your money so easily. You have a future and please dont let that future be years of homelessness in old age.

Everybody was making money and I bought a “yolo” last week (my first option) it was a SPY call and I made like $400 and it was so easy.

My wife and I bought a house and we took out a loan on the equity (about $150k) and the quickest way to pay it off was buying more “yolos” on SPY. I did 340C for 6/19, took out like 200 of them

I checked it today and it’s basically all gone, and now the contractors need to get paid because they just finished work on the garage and started on the kitchen, but I can’t withdraw money??  Basically only about 5% of my loan is left.  How can I get this back?  Should I sell them and buy the other thing, puts?  On SPY?

I regret listening to that guy at work and this is a stupid way to make money and I kind of think it’s a scam

Options should not be more than (in my opinion) 25% of portfolio. I break this rule constantly.

No more than 20% of portfolio in one position unless it’s stock and in something reasonable stable (FAANGM, SPY, IWM, VOO, etc) again I break this and it often burns me

Focus your investments on a group of things like indexes that are already diversified or an industry.
tech, REITs, travel, etc. you can’t possibly keep up with everything in the market, pick a few and study up. Learn and rotate sectors as you see fit but if you’re going to be in everything do it IN AN INDEX 

YOU CANNOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PICK THE RIGHT 1 AIRLINE THE RIGHT 1 BANK THE RIGHT 1 SOCIAL MEDIA PLAY, etc etc

I capitalize because people here always get fucked on that

Take 30-50% on option profits if you’re smart. if you’re a degenerate like me wait for it to hit +100% and take the initial investment out.

Learn theta strategies. Don’t use them, but know thy enemy.

That’s my 2 minute 101 course for the new guys who got fucked this week.

VIX boosted from 25 to 40.  This indicates that institutions are hedging their longs with puts.

DIX is up slightly from yesterday, still above 45%.  This indicates that buying activity didn’t go down.  Pretty flat.

GEX tanked, which indicates that volatility is expected to be higher, because low GEX means more put buying, instead of call selling against longs.

This tells me that institutions have no idea what’s gonna happen, but they’re preparing for something big.  If this was just a dip in their eyes, VIX wouldn’t have shot up so high, and GEX wouldn’t be so low.

It looks this comes down to whether the new retail traders who bought in with stimulus checks are going to continue panic selling.  They were responsible for most of the rally, and they will be responsible for the selloff.  They are unpredictable.

If you think retail has paper hands, buy puts.

If you think retail has diamond hands, it’s a great call buying opportunity."

""As a result, the Korean Peninsula has now turned into the world's most dangerous hotspot haunted uninterruptedly by the ghost of nuclear war, streaming completely against a durable and lasting peace which has been committed to by both sides,"" state media KCNA quoted Ri.

Furthermore, Ri insisted that North Korea's main goal remains to strengthen its military capacities which will be able to cope with ""long-term military threats"" coming from the US.

Almost everything you read about the stock market is the opposite of the truth. Last week and a half, CNBC, Barron's, Motley Fool, Insider, Seeking Alpha etc, saw the sentiment of their articles shift from bearish (in a bull market) to bullish. This has always been designed to create liquidity in the positions of hedge funds and investment banks, allowing them to exit them at the expense of retail investors. The narrative has now shifted back to bearish while the smart money gets long again.

I don't think it's super likely, this is more big hands sensing an opportunity and having the means to go short and create a snowball effect. There was nothing people didn't know Monday driving this except a small uptick in tested cases, most likely due to increased testing as non-essential hospital services tick back up, meanwhile influenza-like illness is down.

This period has been what 3 months of reduced output. Realistically the market should only be worth 5-10% less than what it was before corona. Taking 10% as a conservative estimate, then we are just about where we should be right now. So some more room for downside if momentum wants to play a part, but also wouldn't be surprising to see a bounce from here. 

People expecting total annihilation of the market are just wishful thinkers. If we get much lower, just receiving the dividend from stocks is going to be worth the price. Meaning any large investor will be buying.

Sooner or later the music has to stop and a recession actually has to happen. The way the weekly chart looks we are most definitely going to have a blow off top over 400 imo...if not, this was it.

2020-06-11 22:49:46,DOESNT_BE_LIKE_IT_IS,4,"Was dabbling on 4chan few days ago and copied this comment to save it. Thoughts?

The Fed is in an inescapable dilemma. One of two outcomes is going to happen imminently.

1. The Fed allows nominal yields to keep rising. This would crash equities and real estate by 90%--it would be worse than the Great Depression. When nominal yields got to only 3% in 2018, the stock market plummeted from 26,500 to 22,500. This was averted only by restarting Q. E. Nowadays, even 1% yields crash the market. We nearly got to 1% yields on Friday--0.90%. Yields could spike any day now. This is why Warren Buffet is staying out of the stock market and hoarding silver.
2. The Fed puts a formal cap on yields, also known as YCC. This would be an admission that 5 trillion in Q. E. hasn't been enough to suppress yields, and that at least 20 trillion more is coming. This means hyperinflation, a crash in the bond market, and monetizing the debt. Stocks would soar in nominal terms, but crash against the price of gold, because hyperinflation would make the gains worthless, as they were in the Zimbabwe or Venezuelan stock-markets.

In other words, the stock market must crash soon. The only question is whether it will happen in nominal terms or real terms.

I think we all know that the Fed will choose to crash it in real terms, because that is the only politically expedient option. The average Robinhood trader will be marvelling at his 500% gains, and the ""best"" stock market in human history, even though the U. S. dollar is on its way to being carried about in wheelbarrows.

Whichever choice the Fed is going to make, the only way to profit from this crisis and protect yourself is to buy gold, gold miners, silver, and silver miners.

1. APMEX, SD Bullion, JM Bullion, Miles Franklin, SchiffGold, are examples of credible bullion dealers in the U. S. If you buy hold-in-hand physical, you will have to pay a premium of at least 4%. To make up for this, buy CGT-free coins--in your case, these are American Eagles. While the stock-market trader who makes a million dollars has to pay $200,000 to the government, you will keep everything you gain.
2. To avoid paying high premiums, get an account on GoldMoney or BullionVault.com, where the premium will only be 0.50%. On these websites, you can buy real bullion which is held offshore in countries like Switzerland and Singapore. When the government confiscated gold in 1933, offshore bullion was left untouched.
3. You can also buy gold and silver mining stocks on any stock-broker. The GDX, GDXJ, SIL, SILJ, are the best indices for this. The miners are leveraged ways to make money on precious metals. If metals go up, they go up far more, and vice versa. For reference, when silver went up from 1 dollar to 2.5 dollars, the average small-cap silver miner went up 150x (not 150%). $100,000 was turned into 15 million. In 2008, those who invested in First Majestic made 17x their money.
4. Do not buy SLV or GLD. These are paper ponzi schemes without the metals which are said to back them. To learn more about this, listen to some of the recent interviews on Arcadia Economics."

One is that stocks are highly inflated and the economy is propped up by QE, buybacks, and printing. The realization of Covid not going away is setting in, and even without Covid the underlying problems are taking effect. So selling, holding cash, buying some puts, and waiting seem to be an option

The other is that these 3 red days are a correction. The economy opening may not lead to another 100,000 deaths. Things may improve. So holding calls, not panicking, and not selling off are another choice.

Im probably not buying any calls that expire past September tho. What is everyone else thinking?"

What has been going on in (C-word) and boomer markets over the last two months is the most glorious episode of human greed I’ve seen since 1999. I know there will be plenty who pooh-pooh that comparison but the speculative trading and the ignorance of those doing it is exactly the same. There are silly things going on, new “traders” doing stupid things and getting away with it because that’s what happens in the end stages of a bull market that has been going on for a decade.  
Hertz, the rental car giant, filed for bankruptcy on May 22 and its stock hit a low of $0.40 a few days later. Earlier this week it traded as high as $6.25. That’s a gain of over 15 times your money if you bought at the low. In 12 days. Did Hertz cancel its bankruptcy? Did Hertz get a last-minute rescue from the Trump administration? No and no. Hertz is still bankrupt. And my quick math says they have $19 billion in debt and maybe $15 billion in assets. The stock is almost certainly worth zero. And yet hundreds of millions of shares are changing hands every day. This is not investing.  
And Hertz isn’t the only stock fools are buying in hopes of finding a bigger fool to take it off their hands at a higher price. Chesapeake Energy was a penny stock and on the verge of delisting from the NYSE earlier this year before executing a 1 for 200 reverse split. Its unsecured bonds trade for less than 10 cents on the dollar. The stock tripled one day this week and at its peak had a market cap of $750 million. The stock is, like Hertz, likely worthless. This isn’t investing either."

2020-06-11 22:33:01,Powerful_Business,27,"  **HAPPENING: Why we are entering The Great Depression 2.0** 

&#x200B;

The current mass delusion is that the Fed can bail everyone out with cost-free cash. But we have to keep in mind what the Fed can't do:  


1. It can't reverse the unprecedented wealth inequality its policies have pushed to the point of civil breakdown.  


2. It can't make people take on the risks and heartaches of starting new businesses.  


3. It can't force employers to hire more employees.  


4. It can't make unprofitable businesses profitable.  


5. It can't force people to buy assets at prices that no longer make financial sense.  


6. It can't make insolvent businesses and local governments solvent.  


7. It can't force people who now realize their priority is to save money to spend their cash, even if the Fed forces negative interest rates so it costs money to have savings.  


8. It can't lower the unaffordable cost structure of the entire economy.  


9. It can't de-link all the financial dependencies in the financial system that make it so vulnerable to the first domino falling.  


10. It can't stop people from selling their assets.  


For example: a worker is laid off and can no longer afford to go to a favorite restaurant. The restaurant's expenses are so high it can't survive on reduced customer traffic, so it closes. The commercial landlord's expenses are so high that he can't afford to lower rents, but since no business can afford high rents, the space is empty and the landlord goes bust. The bank holding the mortgage then has to absorb a staggering loss because the property is no longer worth much because a building without tenants is just a money-pit of expenses and no income.  


The once-valuable restaurant business is now worth zero. The once-valuable commercial property is now worth 0  


We are entering The Greatest Depression because there is no exit. Either the phantom wealth of asset bubbles completely vanishes, or the phantom purchasing power of fiat currency vanishes. Both paths lead to the same destination: systemic collapse."

That means there should be more safe havens this time around than there were the first time, when people were panic selling because they had no clue what the fuck was going on. 

I have super long-dated calls on B2B businesses that shouldn't be heavily impacted even if  we do extend lockdowns.  Will be interesting to see if this theory holds up or whether dumb mother fuckers just panic sell anything and everything again."

permaBull, gayBear, thetaGang cockroach, pussyCash moneyGang—all these “perma” “Gayness” and “gangs” is a misdirection—choosing a side massacres your potential.

Limit yourself as a permaBull, you constrain yourself to call options—losing money when the underlying goes down.

Limit yourself as a gayBear, you constrain yourself to put options—thus losing money when the underlying goes up.

Limit yourself a thetaGang cockroach, you constrain yourself to baby-dick gains—losing the potential of large gains.

Limit yourself as a pussyCash moneyGang—why the fuck are you here in the first place?

There is no permaBull.

There is no gayBear.

There is no thetaGang cockroach.

What remains is the Goal.

And the Goal is simple: Yachts, lambos, hoes (gardening), retiring two or three decades earlier than your peers, enjoying money, gambling and gambling away.

Yet staying with a singular side—be it bull or bear or theta—reaching such a goal will be a long arduous journey.

But by playing all sides as a Strategic-Machiavellian-Geopolitical-Tactical GAMBLER, perhaps the universe will dance on your lap. Or perhaps I’ll get fucked by all sides. And I’ll enjoy it either way.

*POSITIONS:*

**XLF 27c,  31c, 32c, 33c 1/15/21**

**Hedging with XLF 22p, 22.5p 6/19**

To them, I say I am *reformed permabull.*

2020-06-11 21:21:51,Provolone_Jones,15,"REDEMPTION STORY FROM A GAY BEAR

TUESDAY, JUNE 9: I was down from 150k to 103k thanks to my unyielding bearish bias. The more the market went up, the more stubborn I became and I continued to buy puts left and right, leading to this week where I decided to give it a last ditch effort and bet it all on the upcoming FOMC meeting crashing the market. At the end of the day I bought roughly 40k worth of SPY 310 puts, exp 6/30.

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10: The FOMC meeting rolls around and it causes a fucking weakass pump which I stubbornly buy 23k more SPY puts (310, 6/30) at the top of. I also buy 6000 shares of SPXS ($40k) for good measure, so basically I used my entire remaining 100k to load myself to the tits with puts and SPXS. I casually check futures a couple of times overnight and try not to get my hopes up too much.

TODAY, JUNE 11th: -2.5% opening, I'm back up to $165k and my gay bear ass has been burned too many times so I sell all 140 of my SPY 310 6/30 puts above 310 (for roughly 90%/54k profit)... but when we break through 310 I can't help but buy up roughly $80k worth of UVXY, 14 SPY 308 6/30 puts, and 23 SPY 300 7/10 puts. At the end of today I sold 6000 of my SPXS shares, all 14 of my SPY 308 puts, and am holding the UVXY shares and 23 SPY 300 puts. I'm now up to 213.2k in my account. *100k -> 213.5k in a few days*. Clenching my asshole right now, hoping I don't lose a chunk of precious gains tomorrow.

I might post screenshots tomorrow after I GTFO of my UVXY position.

TL;DR: After losing 50k to the bulls this past month, I made 113.5k in 2 days by being a stubborn gay bear. Still holding 114k worth of UVXY and 26.5k of SPY 300 puts (have 72.7k in cash)."

Then money makers sell large amounts to scare retailers in selling their shares. Money makers buy back in. The February-March drop had more reason for the negative sentiment than today. Back then, there was some resistance at support levels. Today, no resistance at any of the support levels between SPY 320 and 300.

I literally lost money on puts. So hyped on anxiety that I would buy puts, it would roll up 50c, I would get terrified, sell at a loss, and watch as it went down another dollar.

Trading is so much more of a mind game than people give it credit for. There literally wasn't a move that my paralyzed anxiety brain could make today that would have worked out. It's not that the markets were against me it was that I was against myself."

Now people are going to say fuck this I’m going to park my money in an ETF cause I’m stupid and they are smart. This ensures that hedge fund managers will always have a job. 

For accounting the Enron scandal didn’t kill accounting. In fact it did the opposite and made it as safe as a job as you could get to stick around. Now it’s mandated by law to get audits if you are a public company and these CPA firms are now as vital to the country and won’t go away."

There was a lad who was decent at picking winner stocks, he was a long term investor.. no options business or gambling problems.. he was even outperforming his 401k returns.. then covid crash happens and he finds this sub.. gainz porn was delicious 🤤 

Then he started playing options for tendies and nuggies.. first few plays were wins, he felt good.. then he starts losing. But the lad doesn’t learn, the more he loses the more he tries desperately to claw back.. result was he wiped 50% of his account..
