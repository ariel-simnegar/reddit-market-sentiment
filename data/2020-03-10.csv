Russia has been trying to destroy US shale ever since they have been passively sitting aside eating up marketshare in the oil industry. They are using this price war to do that. Russia has been increasing production, and stockpiling for this in the short term, while Saudi has been cutting. Saudi raised production to 13mbpd after saying they had the potential for 12.3. Russia has a meeting with oil producers in Russia today and will most likely up their bpd as well. This peace talk promise compromise bullshit from Mexico saying they‚Äôve solved the problem and will solve it again was in 1998 when Mexico was a non-OPEC producer and played the innocent guy caught in the crossfire. Mexico now produces 40% less, is an OPEC country, and has insurance on their oil production industry. This price war is going to drag on for a long time and for all you idiots saying woohoo I can DCA my 2021/2022 USO calls, how about just wait for a better entry point instead of watching your portfolio bleed away because you think this is the bottom. 

America is not going to capitulate to Russia‚Äôs aggressive attempt to recapture marketshare and there will probably be incentives for US Oil to keep producing at a loss. Meaning even more supply with less demand due to corona virus and a global growth slowdown. It doesn‚Äôt matter how cheap it is if nobody can use it. Airlines are down, cruises are down, manufacturing is starting back up in China but will be hit in the US and EUROPE soon. Instead of being a moron and bragging about DCAing your calls just wait for the actual bottom or at least April 5th when you can see the new prices Saudi will charge for next month.

2020-03-11 06:54:27,recentlyunearthed,7,"Ok more than one person asked so here is what a repo is:

You know how you put money in the local bank? And they pay you 0.15% a year for the privilege?

Well your local bank doesn‚Äôt just let those sweet tendies collect dust, they make loans to local businesses. Don‚Äôt worry tho. Cuz 1) they are federally insured and 2) the bankers put their own money at risk before yours.

Welp if you aren‚Äôt a vanilla bank but an investment bank you don‚Äôt get deposits from local truck drivers. You go to the open market and get scared or stagnant (unemployed for two+ weeks) cash and pay basically nothing, just like your bank pays you basically nothing.

So imagine uhaul wants to update its fleet in two months, we‚Äôll they don‚Äôt want big exposure to the market (see: now) but they have $200 million dollars.

They will issue a repo or repurchase agreement. 

J.P. Morgan says: I‚Äôll take that money, pay you some peanuts, here are some t-bills I have as collateral, and don‚Äôt worry, I lose everything before you lose a dime. And it‚Äôs only two weeks, I‚Äôm not going to explode in two weeks, right? C‚Äômon. Free peanuts. I want to make a bunch of loans to fracking companies and make money on the spread! 

Well the interest rate on repos got pretty high about a year ago and now the fed is doing it with printed money. So they make new money and deposit it in the investment banks (just like when you deposit your paycheck, you expect to get it back) because they really really want it pweeze.

Edit: I did say I was drunk. Fixing a lot of typos."

-Cheaper oil will provide short-term stimulus to the US consumer. 

-The Fed is keeping employment stable. 

-Corporate debt bubbles won‚Äôt be popped because of the emergency Fed cut with potentially more on the horizon.

-Fiscal stimulus is being dangled.

-Pandemics don‚Äôt last longer than recessions, even if they lead us there eventually.

-Coronavirus happening during a late-cycle global slowdown has its own benefits, such as early central bank stimulus.

-A benefit of inequality is incredible fluidity to keep asset prices stable.

-The USD is the global reserve with positive interest rates while the rest of the world is negative. 

-A technical recession does not mean the cycle is over because we were so overbought.

TLDR:

Infectious Disease Expert in Seattle asked State and Federal Officials for help to get COVID-19 testing ready and was denied in late January.

She did the tests anyway in late February without approval and got a positive test from a teenager with no recent travel history.

States such as NY and CA can't test enough and the scale of the outbreak can't be accurately measured yet.

South Korea and USA had discovered their first case around the same time. South Korea has been capable of testing 10,000 people a day since late Feb.

USA has a total of 8,500 specimens to date. **TOTAL**. Meaning they have tested **LESS** than 8,500 people since 1 person requires more than 1 swab."

Before it was glorious, Bulls in high spirits, memes were positive and generally shitting on the seething predators (Hyenas/gheybears) begging for collapse and destruction and a huge dick in their ass. The population was healthy, everyone was making money. 

Now that Scar (gheybois) killed Mufasa (bulls) the whole world is in turmoil and facing a pandemic. Real people dying and getting gravely ill, businesses going bankrupt, fun events being shut down, countries quarantined, travel ban, people on edge from how much money they‚Äôve lost. 

This is what the bulls were fighting against. This is what the evil side looks like. Pure fuckin evil. They want more, they‚Äôre never satisfied, they want death, they want ruin, bad news excites them and they laugh like the hyenas they are. 

I can‚Äôt wait till Simba (bulls) becomes king again. I miss the good times. I miss rooting for my country. I miss the positivity, the memes, everything. 

In the mean time though, I‚Äôm forced to be one of them. I have to, it‚Äôs the only way to survive these money starving times. So with that being said,

Edit : Before the name checks out and lul rekt posts. I still have more money than any of you ever will. And yes I'm insecure enough to have to state that to autistic 18 year olds.

Second most painful loss is TSLA - started buying the dip in May of last year and got stopped out at $178 - bottom was $176.99. Obviously, I wouldn't have held through the parabolic rally, but it still irks me to this day I literally sold the bottom."

How MGM Resorts International is Taking Steps for Guest Safety

Dear Yoloornoglow

As a loyal M life member, we feel it is important to reach out to you personally to share the changes we are making in response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our guests and employees. While we always strive to maintain the highest standards when it comes to cleaning and maintaining our resorts and casinos, we're taking it even further by increasing the frequency of our cleanings, concentrating on public areas.

We are continuing to follow the guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and are in regular contact with local health officials.  Keeping our employees informed and giving them the tools they need to keep themselves and our environment safe is our highest priority.

We know customers are looking for flexibility as they make their travel plans.  That's why when you book a new room reservation by April 30th, 2020 through our website, app or call center you will be able to cancel or rebook your reservation prior to arrival without charge.  We want you to plan with confidence and peace of mind.

For guests who already have room reservations with one of our Resorts, if your travel plans are impacted by the virus, we are here to help. Please contact (866) 761.7111 so we can assist you and help you find the right solution. Again, we want all our guests to feel comfortable and confident in planning and coming to enjoy our world class accommodations, restaurants and entertainment.

Our Corporate and Resort leadership teams are meeting daily to monitor the situation and we pledge to continue communicating with you and keeping you updated.

We are especially grateful for your loyalty and we look forward to welcoming you to your favorite M life and MGM Resort in the near future.

Sincerely,

signature
Jim Murren
Chairman and CEO

2020-03-11 03:58:54,aglowwiththeflow,31,"Maybe the mods let the post through maybe not. Here's a quick explanation of repo:

Since most autists on this sub thinks repos are just JPow pumping the markets up with funny money I decided to make a post to explain it.

Repurchase agreements aka repos are agreements that the Fed enters with banks to make sure that there is enough in reserves/liquidity for banks to continue to loan money to businesses or customers. These loans are paid back the next day or within a period of time shorter than 2 weeks in most cases. When done once in a very long while these are no big deal as the bank keeps money flowing and the Fed makes money off the interest from the short term loan.

[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements)

Since September 2019 we have engaged in the only large scale, long lasting repo effort since 2008/2009. The link below shows the rate of repurchase agreements in that time. This indicates that banks do not have enough liquidity to do day to day lending and we are moving towards a liquidity crisis unseen since the last recession.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0)

Do we avoid this? Maybe with smart policy, luck on the CV front and an OPEC+ agreement. If those things don't happen we may see the Fed lower rates to 0, engage in full on QE and start to assume toxic assets to brunt a possible collapse. - All speculation but it's my guess if CV hits hard and OPEC+ dig in on this production surge.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Repos are not JPow sending the markets to the moon with newly minted cash, they're to prevent our banking system and the businesses that rely on it from collapsing.

Editing in a comment from below:

Since interest rates are so low and the markets were doing so well, CFOs wouldn't be doing their fiduciary requirements if they didn't take loans to maximize their share holder value and do stock buy backs, sending the price higher. This has created a bubble of basically free money and increasing value. The interest rate on this debt is so low that if the market was outperforming that interest rate, the companies can make more money off of leveraging that debt. This has led to the highest levels of corporate debt ever.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS)

If we collapse too hard without thorough government intervention, companies will start to default on their interest payments and the largest corporate credit bubble in history may burst. I don't think Trump and the Fed will let that happen but we're being hit with the 1-2 combination of a demand/supply chain issue from CV and cheap oil kneecapping energy."

Dear Raconteuring,

As you are planning your next visit to one of Caesars Entertainment‚Äôs properties in North America, we anticipate that you may have questions about the company‚Äôs efforts to manage Coronavirus (COVID-19). Every day, we closely monitor and analyze developments and statements from local, national and international health agencies, and we are taking actions to comply with their directives which are based on facts and medical science.


There is no issue more important to us than making sure we manage this situation as effectively as possible so you continue to feel confident visiting us. We have appointed a senior management team who meet daily to make decisions on how we can further improve our programs and actions to help protect guests and employees. The health authorities tell us that, to prevent the spread of Coronavirus, we must: wash hands frequently, heighten cleaning practices, avoid contact with sick people, stay away from work when ill and not travel to areas with high infection rates. All our actions are focused in these areas.


Here‚Äôs where we are at this time:


We are reminding employees through multiple channels about washing hands often. We are talking to them about it, posting signage in key employee areas, and providing additional hand sanitizer dispensers as well.


For guests, we are posting hand-washing signage in public areas (e.g., bathrooms) and providing more hand sanitizer dispensers across our properties in high visibility and high traffic areas. We are also increasing our reserves of hand sanitizers for use by our guests and employees over an extended period.


We are buying more cleaning and disinfectant supplies. We are increasing the frequency of cleaning high-touch surfaces in public areas in our casinos/resorts, including restaurants, bars, spas, fitness centers, public restrooms, hotel rooms, elevators, as well as frequently touched areas on the casino floor.


We are reinforcing training procedures to ensure cleaning processes are implemented properly by our employees.
We have suspended international business travel to areas with higher infection rates. And, if any of our employees travel to those areas for personal reasons, they will be required to stay home for three weeks upon their return.
If an employee appears to be suffering from flu-like symptoms, they will be asked to promptly seek medical attention and to remain at home until they are free of symptoms.


We are encouraging guests who are ill to seek medical attention and to avoid public exposure as much as possible. We have also established protocols to help guests get the medical attention they may need. We are using sanitizing procedures in hotel rooms where guests who become ill are staying.


We appreciate your business and loyalty to Caesars. We are committed to implementing recommendations from the health authorities to give you peace of mind as you visit our properties now and in the future. The health and safety of our guests and employees will always be our most important consideration, especially in these challenging circumstances.

We look forward to seeing you soon.

Tony Rodio

As older people die their wealth will be passed down to younger generations (obviously), but the intelligence of the average person (Investors especially) has declined significantly because there are no barriers to entry. This makes it easier to rid the sheep of their money.

When I tried to sell using TD, the default limit price was what it was before the jump, not the price while it was closed. I didn't have a chance to try and place a sell order before the market reopened and they jumped back to the normal price.

Relative to Other Countries, US Labor and Healthcare Policies are a Perfect Storm for Pandemics

* Zero universal guaranteed [paid sick leave](https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/for-how-long-are-workers-guaranteed-paid-sick-leave)
* Even among those \*with\* paid sick leave, the covered time frame is often on the order of days, not the weeks adequate to account for prolonged illness.
* Zero guaranteed paid family leave to care for sick members
* Zero guaranteed financial or operational support for people who should self-quarantine. [People are therefore ignoring quarantine because they need to eat.](https://twitter.com/iKaylaReed/status/1237006777474060294)
* Many people are uninsured. Given where things are right now (cryptic transmission and no available vaccine), the insurance companies have a moral obligation but have no financial incentive to improve testing and ensure access to care.
* In the USA insurance is tied to their employment, so when they get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy. In a pandemic year this is devastating for an economy.

My thought being is that if oil crashes again, we would probably see a shit ton more pain.

However, oil spike on no news. That‚Äôs why I think someone got margin called and had to cover their positions, to then liquidate assets (probably in China since their markets just about to open).

And now we are seeing oil get some relief and shoot up, but futures are still struggling lower?
And long bonds trending downward again.

Think in for a surprise and some pain. Probably some Lehman shit going on right now. Except in China, which will then impact us."

Instead of organizing a massive response, they're taking this opportunity to shove more dollars into their pockets.

Think about this. Corona is threatening the economy by contracting consumer spending. Payroll taxes fund social security. 100% of that is spent. They're literally contracting consumer spending in response to contracting consumer spending.

These guys are so self absorbed and retarded. We are headed for the worst economic disaster in the history of the united states.

The only silver lining is that for the first time in US history, it wasn't directly the banks' fault."

edit: Michael T. Osterholm is a public health scientist and a biosecurity and infectious disease expert in the United States. Joe Rogan had him on his episode for his podcast and they discussed coronavirus. Osterholm is saying this is going to be 6-12 month issue that impacts older people and those with underlying health issues such as obesity. He predicted/studied this type of scenario playing out, how it would impact supply chain and wrote about it in his book. He doesn't believe its bio-weaponized and discredits other myths of using saunas, probiotics, etc to fight it. Osterholm also states that washing your hands and not touching your face hasn't been captured as affective prevention but that White House officials and public want something to be able to do. Furthermore, he mentioned that saying that the risk is low is a false assertion. Still going through the video but it's very informative.
