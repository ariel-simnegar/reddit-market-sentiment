Fundamentally I trust this trade 100% because fed printing money and all of that shit. Equity markets have had an insane 11 year bull run, is it time for precious metals to run?

"" The price smash started when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, known for his devotion to money printing as the remedy for all economic ailments, disappointed investors. He didn't announce a major new initiative to flood asset markets with more cash. Disappointed ""long"" traders began selling their contracts. As prices fell, the margin calls began ‚Äì forcing weak hands to sell. Then major U.S. and Asian exchanges increased margin requirements. The result of these rapid-fire events was a near-term rout in the paper prices for gold and silver. "" Turns out Jerome wasn't the original money printer, so I guess we bail on SLV when Jerome turns off the printer."

2020-08-10 01:45:54,Servletless,6,"I drove a Tesla Model 3 this weekend and I think I finally understand the bull case. They figured out how to make a car for less and sell it for more. Everything is software-controlled so there are far fewer moving parts to manufacture and install. Electric engine means no toxic fluids or hot exhaust gases to pressurize, seal, filter, catalyze, burn, etc, so your materials engineering requirements are far more lenient and the whole propulsion apparatus takes up far less space. The resulting extra interior space means they can fleece their customers into thinking they are in a much larger car. Glass roof means you can market and charge for a sunroof and not actually install one. Sleek interior design masks lack of control over your AC vents. Auto Pilot is just cruise control plus lane-keeping. Over 80% of the car by mass (doors, trunk, tires, seats, windows, floor mats) consists of tech no different from a Nissan Versa or Chevy Spark.

Unfortunately for them, other manufacturers are catching wind of this gravy train.

Then appearently a big squad of guys with supercars (lambos etc.) were driving by slowly.

It was such an awesome atmosphere, and it just showed me what life could be like.

Funny thing is that I am not even american and never visited Beverly Hills.

It was quite a mysterious dream and I want to make it become reality, but I want to be one of the guys in the supercars.

Good luck to you all, remember.. you only have one life, so one chance to live your dream, doesn't matter what it is."

2020-08-09 22:32:36,waylon106,-2,"The role of money-lenders in history was once aptly termed by many acute observers as the ""Hidden Hand."" It is the power to create, lend and accumulate interest on ""credit,"" and then re-lend that interest for further interest, in perpetuity, that creates pervasive, worldwide debt, from the individual, to the family, to the entire state. The ability to operate a fraudulent credit and loan system has long been known, and through all the slickness of a snake-oil salesman, the money-lenders - the same types Jesus whipped from the Temple - have persuaded governments that banking is best left to private interests. Many wars, revolutions, depressions, recessions, and other social upheavals, have been directly related to the determination of these money-lenders to retain and extend their power and profits. When any state, individual or idea has threatened their scam they have often responded with wars and revolutions. The cultural and material progress of a civilization will often relate to the degree by which it is free from the influence of debt, and the degradation that results when the money-lenders are permitted to regain power. Hence, Goodson shows that both World Wars, the Napoleonic wars, the American Revolution, the rise and fall of Julius Caesar, the overthrow of Qathafi in Libya and the revolution against Tsar Nicholas, among much else relate to this ""Hidden Hand"" in history. This is the key to understanding the past, present and future."

The honest truth is that I have so many calls and so many calls that are way ITM, I can't figure out balancing profits with taxes & exercising calls, and buying more.

ticker/strike/date   actual closing on expiration

RF 14c 7/17   -  10.32

DXC 18c 6/19 - 15.43

NCR 21c 7/17 - 17.69

I made money previous to that as a swing trader, my account was up 25% on the year.  Even the swing trades were somewhat idiotic.  Buy DXC at 14.50, sell at 14.70.  But, they made money, somehow....

In 2 months, what would I say I know now about options - very little, but pay attention to the greeks.  Very few options trades have much chance of success, so be very picky.  Don't get into an options position because you like the stock, be sure you like the risk."

But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.

Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of ~~a bailout~~ Stimulus.
