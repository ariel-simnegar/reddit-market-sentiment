2019-10-24 08:12:31,,2,"""The eurozone economy started the fourth quarter mired close to stagnation, with the flash PMI pointing to a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.1%. “The manufacturing downturn remains the fiercest since 2012, and continues to infect the service sector, where October saw the smallest increase in new work for almost five years. “The labour market is meanwhile being hit as firms retrench amid signs of excess capacity and uncertainty about the year ahead intensifies. Optimism about future prospects deteriorated further in October to the lowest for over six years, commonly linked to global trade tensions, Brexitrelated worries and increasingly gloomy economic forecasts. “A further deterioration in jobs growth adds to the risk that the trade-led weakening is spreading further to the household sector, which could dampen growth further as we head towards the end of the year.""

2019-10-24 04:18:27,marimano,-9,"I gotta re-evaluate my eagerness. It might've been my lack of sleep these past days/weeks, but I've gotten riskier and riskier for no reason other than greed and the rush of it all. 

The plays that I had the most confidence in I invested the least amount of capital (today's SPY 299.5C 10/25 -- 28%+ EOD). The ones I spotted and felt a gut reaction I doubled down (CAT 11/1 130P; MSFT 10/25 135P)

I'm almost tapped out and we're just about to get a good groove going.

My highest confidence money maker play right now (50%) is WMT puts. 11/15 $115P would be my best bet. Ride that down towards ER and maybe play conservative on 11/14. Take profits and see if economy implodes at that point. I'd be surprised if SPY hadn't taken a shit by then too.

SPY: ride the next low volume pump to 301 and then short term puts. Depending on economic + political data, rinse and repeat or hold off and ID if a big rogue wave is coming (look @ vol, random sell offs of well performing stocks; more Fed shenanigans like NOT raising interest rates EOM; banks randomly pricing up major SPX players even though everyone's reporting lowered guidance). The next near ATH should be a big indicator of what's to come. If its high volume and actually breaks 301 and especially breaks through to 303, bear season is delayed. If we feebly grace 301 and fall hard (check vol) again, it's definitely time for big boy PUTS.

That said, I have a feeling we'll hit 301, slow bounce back one more time to mid 299-300 to solidify that the confidence is just not there, and the next bear wave will be in solid form around 11/11. Why wouldn't there be quadruple knives for all those who try to catch them? 🔪🔪/🔪🔪

https://imgur.com/a/yfqnn0m for my pictures and shit that I've been making my BS calls on and speculations on.

SO if I had the cash, tomorrow: 

Load up on WMT 11/15 115P for value. If I had real money, deeper ITM strikes at later dates. Watch the last big support line from last time but we should be OK (118.5 11/24; 119 11/25). 

SPY: wait for all the juicy data coming out. It's most likely gonna be not good, but the more important thing is watching how the market reacts. Mortgage news have been piss poor but market has been deflecting it all like the HULK. Any time we hit 301 or break 300 comfortably, buy PUTS and sell around 299 till 10/30. From there, check the pattern and see if holding onto long dated puts will be a decent play.

Just wanted to share with ya'll since I've had a really lovely time goofing off here with the whole gang, bulls and bears. If you have any criticism, feel free to let me know. I'm a total noob at this shit and haven't even learned the greeks properly (ruh RHO) nor any spreads and shit (covered calls? who the fuck has money for covered anything?). I'd love to learn a thing or two from you guys.
