#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 

#____________________

Asian markets take a temporary halt from the rally

Today they are slightly red

India down 1.2 %

Hang seng down 0.5%

Nikkie down 0.07%

#_____________________


Europe indices are facing more pressure than Asian counterpart

Dax down 1.63%


CAC 40 down 1.69 %


FTSE down 1.71%


#_____________________


Dow trading at 25690  being 1.27 % down


Global markets today are down but not giving a Bearish sentiment on long charts as these pull backs are small when compared to the rally they had


#____________________


Trade setup for today

Spy much likely will take halt from its past rally but there is no Bearish scenario bets to play as we are expecting flat session



Support has shifted from 305 to 309 after the recent weeks action but only time will tell strength of this support



315 comes out to be a surprising new resistance coming from this week's price action



Personal bias is that 315 will be taken out but not in short span




#There is no clear trend for bearish or Bullish scenario today, thus will not participate in derivatives today on intraday basis, but will try out a long play on taking a bullish bet at 310 for long calls to hold over night



Spy continues to to trend upwards in long chart  thus not looking to get involved in bearish bets till 320, reversal or breaking of 320 will decide next direction



#Todays recommendation is to avoid any intraday trade as lower end of spectrum will be tested, will wait to see a trend to form 


#____________________




Long term : as usual, major indices are on uptrend with vix making new lows on long charts this the recommendation stays the same, go long using it SIP strategy to benefit the current volatility 

#_____________________


Random tip for the day : ""not having any position is also a position""

""I can trade for free with my tradestation, firstrade, TDA and interactive brokers (ib) accounts (and those are just the ones I use....Schwab etc are also now free).  Why would I choose robinhood? 

 The worst part about robinhood?  You cant trade premarket until 9:00.  It is horrible.  So many times I've seen robinhooders wake up to bad news like an offering at 7 am...and have to watch helplessly while they lose money while everyone else can trade.  With tradestation and tda you can trade at 8.  With the free version of ib you can trade at 7.    Ib is by far the best option for free trading, in my opinion.  Besides the 7 am start, the biggest benefit is you get full access to their available short stocks (which is much better than any of the others).  Their margin rates are also the lowest (or very near the lowest).""

I used to burn CD's, fill MP3 players, Catalog a library of music, rip cd's to the computer, etc. I've used all kinds of different interfaces

Apple has the worst playback suggestions out of everyone. I like having music recommended to me by the AI that can basically cross reference my history and other people's that are similar, and tell me what to listen to next.

The 35th sector rotation in the last week was observed from tech to other tech took front seat as Apple in a stunning display of wasted productivity and dollars rallied throughout the day before reversing course to accomplish absolutely nothing.  A number of permabulls were sighted at the top of the tremendous rally wondering if it would be one day or two days until all time highs were once again revisited to relieve them of their calls.  Wall Street Bets users were overheard observing that it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway, as those who had bought at the top would paper hand their positions into oblivion (Ticker: MGM) at market open.

In other news, certain users of Wall Street Bets had still somehow been tricked into believing they were in a bull market even though zooming out to anything other than a 5 minute chart showed an accelerating downtrend over the last two weeks.

Bears, hungry on the news of a downturn, seized the day with a startling array of puts without understanding that volatility was falling exactly as fast as their positions were expanding, leaving them with little to show for the experience but a sense of righteous indignation, a sore ass, and a more complicated tax return.

And finally, in what will likely be the feel good story of the year, Kang Gang was vaporized in a bouncy house mishap earlier today. Investigators discovered the structure had been filled with hydrogen instead of the required hot air (Ticker : NKLA).  Nothing of value was lost in the explosion."

2020-06-24 01:57:17,frzgg,10,"My theory on low death count with trending cases is two fold; 1) lagging indicator and we won't see the real increases starting for a week and 2) March significantly undercounted the number of cases.  I think most regions were hit hard in February and the death numbers spiking in March were a result of the February cases that were not identified at the time.  

When we were reporting 20k cases a day, I think actuals were well over 100k which means mortality rate is much lower but we'll most likely get > R2+ shortly which will get us north of 40k cases a day by either Friday of this week or Tuesday of next week.  With hospitalizations lagging new cases by 2+ weeks, if March data remains steady new cases will take 3~ weeks for deaths to be realized.

Not sure how the market will react but by this time next week, we'll have our highest totals by far on weekly cases and maintain an uptrend in deaths."

Sure there are some exceptions in tech, but there isn't exactly a rush to buy utilities, industrials, or other traditional safe haven investments.

I can't remember the country being so divided and on it's knees ever in my life. Obviously no one is as powerful as it or can destroy it head on militarily - but there is the opportunity to make it implode economically, politically and socially so the country bleeds itself out. In this sense, Trump's plan to make America great again is no different to Erdogan wanting to revive a powerful Ottoman empire or the British who voted leave with romantic memories of how they were a world leading power in it's heyday.

Google has been putting money in a shit ton of different things, they have an android app for gallery to having one of the best self driving research. 

Earnings have been bad for google over past years, if you last 3 years earnings, stock fell most of time after earnings. Stock is yet to break all time high, most of the rise is due to index funds. Google has made investments in very breakthrough technologies such as self driving cars, however self driving cars will be very efficient only after a couple decades.

I don't really know shit about dick, so I could be way off, but I actually think curtailing the h-1b program long term is bad for America.  I work for a big tech company and when they first started pulling back on the visas, we just went to India and opened an office there.  We get like three people for the price of one Bay Area engineer.  The reason I think it's bad for America is because now instead of these workers coming to the US, being paid USD, paying US taxes, and spending money on US soil, all of that money just stays in India."

I wait until RSI is below 30 or above 70. When the histogram of the MACD changes color set a limit buy for an option that's out of the money by 2-3 strikes at the bid or sometimes at 1 cent less than the bid. I don't chase the buy if the market turns around without the trade executing.

If it executes, set a limit sell order for somewhere between 15% - 20% profit and a stop loss at -10%. I usually base these exits on where the resistances are to be sure it will hit my sell order and is unlikely to hit my stop loss.

Sometimes, if  I'm feeling more risky, I do this if RSI is around 35 or 65 and a turnaround is occurring. Sometimes I wait until the color change is confirmed for a second histogram bucket if the market is squirrely but I'm less likely to get the limit buy when I do that.

I'm generally only holding the options for 5-15 minutes with this strategy."
