2020-02-13 04:32:07,oregon_forever,21,"This article explains why MSFT should win tomorrow's decision.

https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/

>And in redacted court filings unsealed Wednesday evening, the government argued not only that **Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause concrete harm to national security.**

>‚ÄúThe continued absence of DoD-wide, enterprise cloud computing capability **seriously impedes the military‚Äôs ability to collaborate and share information with our military services, partner nations, and the intelligence community**,‚Äù Lt. Gen. Brad Schwedo, the Joint Staff‚Äôs chief information officer wrote in a declaration to the court. ‚ÄúThe United States **cannot expect military success fighting tomorrow‚Äôs conflicts with yesterday‚Äôs technology. Providing DoD with rapid access to an enterprise cloud, one which provides elastic computing power and storage, is vital to U.S. national security**.‚Äù

>To win the injunction, among other factors, **Amazon needs to show that it‚Äôs likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage** than the government‚Äôs would if the JEDI buildout was paused.

>And the arguments DoD and the Justice Department are presenting to the court appeared to be meant to **show the government would be harmed in multiple ways.**

>‚ÄúJEDI‚Äôs (cross-domain solutions) solve the modern software development conundrum ‚Äì non-traditional contractors will develop software at the unclassified level, and DoD can then move that software up to Secret (and/or Top Secret),‚Äù Sharon Woods, the director of the department‚Äôs Cloud Computing Program Office wrote in another declaration. ‚ÄúEarly adopters will need the interim period to produce software that is ready to use CDS when the Secret level is launched. Delaying development of JEDI‚Äôs unclassified services will delay software development work that must first occur in the unclassified JEDI environment.‚Äù

>In another filing unsealed on Wednesday, government attorneys objected to another request Amazon has made of the court as part of its lawsuit: to authorize sworn depositions of President Donald Trump and several other officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former secretary James Mattis.

>AWS asserts that testimony would shed further light on one of the central arguments of its protest: the company‚Äôs allegation that DoD‚Äôs decision to award the contract to Microsoft can only be explained by alleged political interference by the president. So far, the allegations are based mainly on public statements President Trump has made that are critical of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, but also on an account in a recent book in which the president was reported to say he wanted to ‚Äúscrew Amazon‚Äù out of the contract.

>In its response, DoD and DOJ called the discovery requests an ‚Äúextraordinary step‚Äù that has no bearing on the questions at issue in the case.

>‚ÄúAWS spends pages and pages detailing the president‚Äôs alleged bias exhibited against Amazon.  Yet **the relevant question in this protest is not whether the president dislikes Amazon, but rather whether the source selection officials ‚Äî the government personnel who actually evaluated AWS‚Äôs and Microsoft‚Äôs proposals and decided which offer or would receive the JEDI contract ‚Äî exhibited bias against AWS in this procurement**,‚Äù attorneys wrote. ‚ÄúParadoxically, program officials were falsely accused of harboring a pro-Amazon bias in the Oracle litigation, which is currently pending appeal.  AWS omits almost all mention of this litigation from its account of alleged bias, perhaps in part because AWS‚Äôs position with respect to supplementation of the record in that protest is inconsistent with the arguments it presents here.‚Äù"

2020-02-12 23:04:21,oregon_forever,8,"Powell basically said that they will keep printing so we are good. In the last 20 years we've had 3 big market drops and each of them happened while Fed wasn't printing or openly supportive (2000, 2008 and 2018-winter). In 2000, Fed's fund rate was 5% and Fed was more worried about inflation risk than anything so it let the markets drop. In 2008, they cut the rates and launched QE but it was too late and started working a few months later in March 2009. In late 2018 we all saw what happened when Powell said ""we might raise rates soon"" and the market dropped 20% but as soon as he changed his word, we went back to rallying. 

In the last 20+ years, we've never had a significant market drop while Fed was supportive of the markets."

I am going to take WSB a bit more seriously now.  

Let‚Äôs quickly talk about MSFT.  I am not a huge believer in their products (mac/Linux guy) but there is significant upside to MSFT - they are literally a subscription company now.  

I am in the cloud space and although AWS is dominant, AZure is winning a significant portion of business.  THINK JEDI.  DONT BRING UP POLITICS.  

People getting into MSFT better stop playing FD‚Äôs. - 99.99% of people are not turning $1k into $49k.  Long term we are gonna WIN. LEAPS ARE GOIJG TO WIN DAMNIT. SO MUCH WINNING. 

Also set your fuckkng stop losses.  I KNOW YOU PEOPLE WANT A 100x BAGGER BUT A LEAST PICK A FUCKING STOP LOSS.STOP GIVING AWAY MONEY PUSSIES.

Look, SPCE is reminiscent of TSLA in 2010 after their IPO.  Except a huge difference ....is Tesla fucking shipped something.   SPCE has had nothing but delays and had to get bought out.  

SPCE NEEDS TO FUCKING launch something this summer - anything, or it will get burned.  

That said I plan to buy SPCE post ER, or when WSb panic sells, which we all know is coming.

2020-02-12 22:54:21,RubenZ217,-6," I  was only nine years old. I loved Elon Musk so much, I had all the memes and Teslas. I'd pray to Elon every night before I go to bed, thanking  him for the tendies I've been given. ""Elon is love"",  I would say, ""Elon is life"". 

My dad hears me and calls me an autist. I  knew he was just  jealous of my TSLA tendies. I called him a cringe normie.  He slaps me  and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in  bed and it's really cold. 

A warmth is moving towards me.  I feel  something touch me. It's Elon. I'm so happy. He whispers in my  ear:

""Don't doubt your vibe"". 

He grabs me with his powerful Cyber hands, and  puts me on my hands and  knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elon. He  penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elon. I can  feel my butt tearing as my  eyes start to water. I push against his  force. I want to please Elon. 

He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my  butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elon looks him straight in the eye,  and says, ""TSLA to the moon"". Elon leaves through my window and drives  away on his Cybertruck. 

Elon is love. Elon is life."

I chickened out though and sold calls against my bought calls to essentially lock in current losses until tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll consider buying back sold calls to benefit off upward movement. But this will allow me to sleep tonight and reevaluate tomorrow. It'll be easier to read in the morning, even if I miss out on a gap up.

I wasn't willing to go overnight with the calls, I have 13k in them and any gap down would be devastating. I weighed reason for up or down movement and it was too hard to tell what will happen, but I sided on a high likelihood of gap down or continued slide for rest of week. Reasons below:

Reasons for gap down/go down:

- indexes up almost 1% and MSFT barely moves. Indexes up almost 2% this week, and MSFT down. Indexes due for some cooling off and I'm afraid what a weak day would look like for MSFT given the strong days were horrible.

- Long weekend coming up. Investors will be derisking soon, especially with such a runup so fast. Could come Thurs, but prob will come Friday. Either way probably not good for MSFT.

- Lower bollinger band still shows potential downside to about 180.

- MSFT ran up a lot and fast valuing it at 1.4trillion, might need to dip a bit and cool off.

- That investigation going on about acquisitions.

- AMZN fighting JEDI contract.

Reasons for gap up/go up:

- It's MSFT and has some of the best investor sentiment.

- No analyst upgrades yet. They're probably coming and will be positive.

- Coronavirus worsens leading people away from things like AAPL and back to MSFT.

- Anything else? Can't really think of any short term."

If it drops overnight I‚Äôll probably buy right back in, and if not I‚Äôll find another horse to ride.

Still have my PCG 10x 3/20 20c position open which is at -40%. It was only $1k anyway and I booked +50% closing my $1k 3/20 SPCE position earlier today. I‚Äôll hold PCG a while longer and see if they want to give me some money.
