If we embrace it then all ways of living are going to change but ultimately for the better. If we don't then we do NOT grow until we finally do advance with the technology available.  
&nbsp;  
This means not giving out trillions to companies that haven't been profitable for years, for them to continue being further in debt. Actually rewarding those that are fiscally responsible and grow. But effect of the economy due to the loss of income because of technology needs to be STRONGLY addressed immediately. We will continue down this stage and will need policy to accommodate it.  
&nbsp;  
Based on how the tech anti-trust hearings went I think we can all safely assume our government is out of touch with what's to come. They're either not prepared or unwilling to adjust to the new norm. The effect of loss of wages/income is going to effect everything and it's going to be a bad period but hopefully fiscal policy can help some of the negative sides."

JPM has to stop shorting Silver or its going to end up losing its vault of silver in London. COMEX accideently became a physical delivery settlement exchange, so no more naked shorts on the market anymore.

When Silver hits $26 again, sell everything you have and BTFD. We aren't there yet but the amount of crowding into the metals market that are demanding delivery is unlike anything we have ever seen. Look around and the world economy, the health of DXY, etc.

CMRX would make sense since [DSTAT](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04389840) actually has benefits for what's been in the news lately (high percentage of COVID-positive cases are left with some form of ALI(Acute Lung Injury)), particularly regarding the link between hypercoagulability and newborn deaths due to the coagulation of the placenta--which apparently it has some serious benefits for.

Perhaps it's confirming that Remdesivir actually is one of the best treatments so far (anecdotal, related to ICU RN's who claim [Remdesivir and Actemra](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/roche-s-arthritis-drug-actemra-fails-covid-19-study-but-remdesivir-combo-data-awaits) have been used in combination with the best results at their hospitals).

>  
>Silver volatility index raised 200% since 20 July: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VXSLV/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VXSLV/)

I also made a prediction  before JPOW speech:

>Current markets are indicating a weaker USD, strong Gold & Silver and a strong stock market due to high inflation **expectations**.  
>  
>If Powell speculates disinflationary in the short term, Gold and Silver will sell off, USD gains and a correction in stock market to Nancy's 300 floor.

And actually this is what JPow said:

>""We see a big shock to demand, we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent, and I do think that for quite some time we're going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than inflationary pressures."" - Powell

First, don’t trade the weeklies on silver the premium is way too high and it’s hard to make money. Buy the leaps, their price fluctuations are still insane especially today but you can hold on down days without feeling like you are going to get wiped out. Second, a down day is in a sense good news. The silver market is highly manipulated and as you saw today with the massive selling which then was instantly bought back up, big boys love to drive the price down before loading up themselves through spoofing etc. In fact JP Morgan has a massive paper short position in silver but a large physical reserve and so they will keep the price down maybe for awhile until they decide they need to cover their short and then they’ll let it rip so their physical silver can become worth big bucks"

2020-07-30 05:21:41,noentic,13,"Daily Market Summary - 

**Context –**

· S&P 500 increased by 1.2% as investors were pleased with the Fed's latest policy directive. The antitrust hearing by the House Judiciary Committee did not phase investors. Most of the gains today came before the start of the Antitrust hearing and the Fed's unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged.

·  **Fed Chair Powell was quoted at the start of the conference saying that the Fed is ""not even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates.""** (Yes, he said ""thinking"" three times). Perhaps he was tired from working the money printer for too long.

· All 11 S&P Sectors ended in positive territory. The largest gainer was Energy, with Consumer Staples being the worst performer.

· Apple (AAPL 380.16, +7.15, +1.9%), Amazon (AMZN 3033.53, +33.20, +1.1%), Alphabet (GOOG 1522.02, +21.68, +1.5%), and Facebook (FB 233.29, +3.17, +1.4%) were all still testifying to the House Judiciary committee at the time of market close.

· Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 76.09, +8.48, +12.5%), Shopify (SHOP 1053.59, +68.59, +7.0%), and Starbucks (SBUX 77.42, +2.78, +3.7%) all had stellar earnings reflected in their gains today.

· On the contrary, Boeing (BA 166.00, -4.84, -2.8%) and General Electric (GE 6.59, -0.30, -4.4%) all closed lower after reporting their earnings. Boeing expects to cut 19,000 jobs and will not see 2019 levels for three years.

Each night, I go to bed hoping I won't wake up. No one cares about me. Nothing brings me joy. Life just seems like a sick fucking joke. I never asked for this ""gift"", yet I'm forced to endure the endless suffering?  If there is a God, he is a cruel, sick bastard and I wish him nothing but the worst. He'd better send me to Hell because I'd lay him the fuck out.

That said, in all likelihood, in 14,000 days or so I'll simply cease to be a conscious entity, dying the exact same as I lived-- a miserable, lonely creature, in financial ruin and without a single redeemable quality."

Not because they support BLM (I couldn’t care less either way) I’m disappointed because they let all of this make it to the field. MLB was the last one I expected to give in and let it out on the field. It’s a damn baseball game. If it’s not needed to play the sport there’s no place for it on the field. At the end of the day they are entertainers paid to play the game. Their personal opinions/beliefs are irrelevant.

1) How much money did Amazon invest. My feeling is Q1 numbers w/ new abrupt costs and massive short-term hiring massively ate into their margins. I don't think that's the case for Q2.

Q1-3 for Apple is usually heavily dependent on Tablet, Ipad, Macbook. There is still quite a bit of phone sales in Q1 but Q2 I had to focus bigly on business sales to make bank. That is the key. No way business sales for Iphones, Tablets, iMacs are big enough to offset iPhone losses.

Q2 with a pandemic there weren't even authorized stores open. Retail spaces were all closed. Online sales are significant, but people will hold off buying a new phone if they can't get some ""tech guy"" to hold their fucking hand in setting up their fucking iCloud transfer.

I got lucky and I've made 100k in arbitrage plays since May, I'm 18. I don't plan on any risky plays. I've switched to thetagang (yeah ik, I suck) I only plan on using 10k worth of collateral at most, I've watched how it has gone for months, and just got in the first time a few weeks ago. I think I can average over 1k a week with thetagang by closing early, looking at my results and calculating losses. I'm moving next week and I'll have rent for the first time in my life. I'm going to be roommates with this 26 year old navy guy, he knows I day trade, he knows a bit about trading because he said ""rh"" when talking about Robinhood, but all utilities are included. So I just need to pay the 700 in rent, then food, how much does that typically cost a month? I'm trying to make a budget now, and then entertainment too, I'm thinking somewhere between 1500 and 2000 a month budget. I have about 20k in a long portfolio. Then about 70k in cash,  I plan to buy the dip with a lot of that cash. If my theta plays go south, then I can cover it. 

I lost my train of thought, but what I'm trying to say is, do you guys think it's a good idea to trade full time? I'm 18 and have gotten lucky, not from anyrhing sexy, nothing risky. Do you guys think I should? Is this a good life decision? I've never have had a job before and at this rate, I don't plan on it, I just need to live frugal."

2020-07-30 00:27:25,dameLillardManiac,15,"VIX high time to buy VIX low look out below

I created a Python program analyzing how much, starting with 100 uvxy shares, on April 1st, I'd have made if every red day (SPY > 1% down) I sell a fraction of my shares and buy SPY shares, and every green day (SPY > 1% up) I sell a fraction of SPY shares and buy UVXY shares. On consecutive down/up days eventually it's all uvxy or all spy.

The result? Initial investment was about 6500 dollars, ended at exactly 8682. Keep in mind though this was completely with shares and not options (I can't find a reliable price API for options).

It's not the perfect strategy, but this should tell us that it works. In this economy, holding vix shares when they drop in value for a spike and then flipping them for spy on down days is just about the safest thing you can do."

2020-07-29 23:39:10,Investinwaffl3s,3,"Did it again.

Was up $2000 off some TSLA momentum swings, and I went to buy one more weekly for a few minute swing trade.

Entered quantity of 1 and ToS has a bug where on a new order, it will reset the quantity field to the default 10. Only happens right when you open a new order and the first time you edit that field. If you enter the number and hit tab, the field is updated. If you do not it resets to 10 when you click submit order.

So instead of 1 TSLA call, I bought 10. Panicked and of course SPY all of a sudden has some giant fucking candles and had to stop loss at - $4000. That would have been a $400 stop if I didn't fuck everything up.

Somehow managed to close the day at +$1500 but still. God damit

Worked hard all morning to swing trade and secure the bag. 10 good small trades wiped out in 3 minutes by one fuck up.

> I think your E/V ratio is causing WACC to be understated. Looks like your E/V weighting is calculated using book value of equity instead of market value. Fama-French and CAPM are designed to estimate the returns public investors require given the risk they're taking on, so if you're using one of those for CoE, you should use market cap for your E/V calculation. This should give you a WACC much closer to 12%, which might bring the intrinsic value per share down around the actual price.

In terms of being able to trade this market has gone to shit. You cant hold anything overnight in this flat fucking market. Calls a month out? Theta gang thanks you for your premium. Theres no buying spy FDs at close for 3 baggers at open like in March. Theres no buying the Disney dip 2 weeks out and printing. Theres no DD. Now we just straight gambling on day trades or get in early on pump & dumps in this flat barren wasteland.  This sub has taken a nose dive as well. I have been in the daily discussion every day since February. The memes now suck, the gifs aren't even close to what they were and there is a serious lack of ""vets"" to drop valuable tidbits in the pile of trash. The fact that for 2 hours today a camera company was the only thing talked about is an indictment on the market and this sub.



half the people here aren't even trading they're just dirty railbird redditors. I want a revival. Where are the bears with their 2nd wave? Where is MSFT 200?  Where is that guy that made the Wolf of Wallstreet GIF that pulled me into this shitstorm hobby?"

Positive news about COVID vaccines is largely hype and clutching at straws, a lot of the trial processes are rushed and executed with much looser standards because of the desperation to get one approved and out to market. I don't see there being an effective, widely distributed vaccine until Q4 2021. I'll admit i know next to nothing about military contracts, but I don't see any commercial airlines already struggling putting in orders for new planes. I don't see the airline industry recovering until 4-6 months after a vaccine is out and being used, and boeing would be even more delayed, its recovery is already somewhat priced in.

I know people have been saying that the Asset Bubble has been remarked on since 2009 but a) now that the economy is contracting, not expanding and b) the Fed is literally running out of bonds to buy (treasury to M.B.S. to Corporate (Junk) Bond ETFs, to what, stock ETFS?) and loose monetary policy is driving inflation up and the dollar down I don't want to play Hot Potato with this insane market any longer.

Don’t fucking touch KODK stock now. The stock has been bid up way past the actual value the loan gave it ($800-$900 MM). There are not going to be as many buyers now and many people (including me) identified the opportunity Tuesday have already sold or are not buying any more. However, low information retail traders could FOMO pump it like today, so don’t short it or buy puts. This market is retarded and based on comments and posts in WSB, many had no idea why KODK was jumping.

Or just sell puts $15 and under."

Everything will be alright.  If you feel sad, hopeless, depressed, lost, etc. please tell someone so you can talk it out.  You are loved and more than your mistakes.  No matter how many you have made.

If you feel like you can't tell anyone around you, start a chat with me.  I am happy to listen or talk to you for minutes, hours, days, whatever helps you get it off your heart. 

Even if you had a new success and wish you could tell someone, I am happy to hear it.

Whatever you do, don't stay alone with them.  You deserve happiness and peace.  Opening up to someone helps that process start."
