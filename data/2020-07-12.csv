He would have spent hours and hours on foreplay, getting their assholes loose enough just so they can take it. i can just imagine them begging for it, with Elon barely able to force it past the knob, and the bears moaning and squirming, demanding him to force it in deeper. They would have orgasm'd within seconds of taking the entire length, being filled and stretched right up to their small intestines. the orgasm would have been powerful, with their anal muscles clamping down on Elon’s throbbing monstrosity, their whole body quivering in euphoria..

2020-07-13 01:59:00,vortex30,24,"CNBC - ""Stock futures rise as investors shake off a continued spike in coronavirus cases""

No, you fucking morons, there are no ""investors"" buying here because they think the COVID spikes are nothing to worry about.

More like, ""Stock futures rise as algos/bots and the Fed work tirelessly to keep them up, whilst inflation of the money supply wreaks havoc on the purchasing power of fiat currency and Zero/Negative % interest rates force money into riskier and riskier assets so that money managers and near bankrupt pension plans can actually find yield somewhere.""

One day this will all collapse, or hyper-inflate. This is bizarro world and is not healthy, at all. But let's keeping pretending ""investors"" have confidence here that COVID spikes are no big deal and therefore they are buying risk assets because ""investors"" think there is nothing to worry about here. There's a shitload to worry about, but no one in power or media wishes to actually tell the truth about the rock and hard place this economy is in.

 Let's keep shrugging off the over 1 million losing their jobs in the USA, every single week, since late March, because manipulated unemployment rates don't look terrible and improved in May/June but really didn't improve much at all going by continued jobless claims numbers only dropped by 7 million people in May and June and the start of July, sounds good, right? Except we are still 12 million claims above the PEAK, the WORST, of 2008/2009 recession, and we've been this way for 4 months now (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCSA). 

Let's forget about the fact that something like 30% of renters/home-owners won't be paying their rent/mortgage in July. Let's forget about the fact that the sports industry, airlines/tourism/hotel/AirBNB industries, movies industry, music industry (concerts), restaurant and bar and nightclubs industries, and others I can't think of right now will not bounce back for years from this. Let's forget about the fact that the Fed just printed $3 trillion in 3 months, more than QE2 and QE3 which was printed over the course of 4 years, and given this fact, either the Fed KNOWS that we're about to get ass-fucked hard by defaults and deleveraging, OR, if they're wrong and CNBC and the ""re-opening optimism!!"" crowd actually turns out to be completely correct, then the sudden booming economy with $3 trillion of excess liquidity we'll see very high levels of inflation. Let's forget about the deficit and the fact that any economic growth will likely be attributable to fiscal stimulus, financed not from taxes but from debt. 

Let's forget that COVID is still a thing, in the USA big-time, but globally it is still getting worse also, and Texas may do a 2nd shut down, California may follow suit if things get bad enough there, and Arizona and Florida are probably too stubborn to do so, but they really ought to as well. Let's forget that a 2nd wave is still highly likely in the North-East and those states WILL shut down a 2nd time if that happens, probably politically calculated to occur either before the election, or afterwards. Let's forget that even if USA is too stubborn to ever shut down again, the rest of the world is not willing to sacrifice their people at the alter of the economy, and USA can't operate some half-way decent economy without the rest of the world being open. Let's forget about the fact that Biden would win a landslide if the election were held today, and he will raise corporate taxes (reversing the whole reason why markets are where they are in the USA, a tax increase probably puts us at SPY $250 based on current P/E multiples and the earnings cut a tax hike would cause, and that is WITHOUT a massive recession/depression).

Let's forget the fact that the China trade deal is effectively over, despite the fact that it kept the markets afloat throughout 2019 and early 2020 via perfectly timed Trump tweets and news releases about ""talks going well"" any time the market appeared to want to sell off. Let's forget that the Phase 1 deal hasn't been implemented yet, there's been talk at times that it is ""over"", and all it really amounted to anyways was China would buy more Soybeans but apparently that was enough for SPY to rally in late January and February despite the fact that a global pandemic was obviously on the horizon.

Let's just fucking forget about everything and keep pumping these markets up. The elite *must not suffer* one tiny bit from this pandemic, because it ""is not their fault!"" aww boo-hoo. Here's $1,200 you fucking plebs, that should last you 5 months and then maybe if you ask nicely we'll print another $700 billion and you'll get $2,000 next time but a portion of that is purchasing power we stole from your life-savings in order to print the money we're giving you sooooo yeeeeeaaaaah. Nothing is real. Nothing matters anymore."

2020-07-13 01:15:44,AllAboutTheSPY,9,"Comparing Italy to United States covid. 

Italy had a lockdown for 9-10 weeks. Even with very strict lockdown measures, countrywide, 242,827 got infected and 34,945 died in a population about 60 million (of which 35% of the population is over the age of 55). Current active cases is on a downtrend with a peak of 100K in mid-April and a current case count of 13K. If you look at the daily deaths chart for Italy you see it peaked sometime in March and has been getting progressively lower each week since then (currently averaging 250 a day or lower)

In the United States we have had only 3,413,995 infected and 137,782 dead in a population of ~330 Million (28.5% over the age of 55). Current active cases is on an uptrend, what we considered the peak of 640K cases in mid-April (mainly led by NYC at the time) was just the beginning as we currently sit on case count of 1,728,824. If you look at the daily deaths chart you see it originally peaked in mid-april with weekly average of 7 day moving average of 2K to an average ~500 daily deaths at the end of June, but we are seeing an uptick and should be back above 1K deaths daily within the next 2-3 days

Overall the comparisons would be fair if the US had acted as Italy had. Mandated masks, lockdown for an extended period of time, reduced social interation, etc. It did not so all the US has done is setup a second peak of 2K deaths a day starting in 2-2.5 weeks.

**With all that said, I'm switching to SPY 330 calls at open because I realize unless someone does a deep dive in the data (which 99% of the US population wont) then until we hit those 2K deaths markets are going to stay bright green.**"

You may be sitting there looking at futures, desperate for hope that your last positions will save your portfolio.  If that is you, please listen.

Please take a step back and re-evaluate.  What keeps going wrong?  Why can't I seem to get this right?  It is time to take it easy and apply a few things.  Be patient, don't trade with emotion, set stop-losses and commit to them (same with profit percentages).  Remember that the market will be volatile for a while.  You're not going to miss out on something if you don't immediately make a trade.

It's okay to go a day without a trade.  It's okay to go several.  It's okay to sit out of TSLA, SPY, AMZN, etc. because you can't afford it. 

Be patient, buy as close to ITM or deep ITM as you can with a tight spread, good delta, and long-dated.  Stop playing weeklies, buy a few weeks out.  Papertrade with ThinkOrSwim for a few weeks to practice.

Everything will be alright, just take care of yourself.  You are important and if you need to step away from trading, do it.  It's okay.  Just don't dig the hole deeper.

It is a new week coming up.  Take your lessons learned and use them to do better.  I believe in you and know you'll be alright."

“This looks like a set-up that is suggestive of continued momentum,” said Shue, a CNBC contributor.

The vastly majority of people are out and about at this point and aren’t acting differently anymore. That’s the truth whether you want to believe it or not. Hospitals aren’t overrun, people aren’t dying in large numbers. But if you turn on CNN or pull up Twitter you would think the world is ending. Kind of ironic the world wasn’t ending a month ago when the media was pushing for everyone to go out and protest for George Floyd.

>the last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Losers get thrown out and only winners are allowed in. 🍏

**Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500** ✅

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think on average around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

For starters, China appears to be in much better economic shape than other large economies. Because investors must allocate their funds somewhere, there is always a comparative element to stockmarket performance. China is the only big economy forecast to grow this year, and is also expected to record the strongest rebound next year, according to projections published by the imf at the end of June. There are grave concerns about the toll that the coronavirus might take in America during the flu season in the autumn. By contrast, China has shown every intention of smothering renewed outbreaks. That has given people and businesses greater certainty about the path ahead."

2020-07-12 20:09:17,CptTonyStark,205,"The one person who best embodies the spirit of WSB is Andrew Carnegie.

He emigrated at the age of 12 to follow the Capitalist American dream. His family was dirt poor so he got a job at his era’s version of the internet/Reddit, first as a telegraph messenger ($2/hr in 2020 money) and then operator ($4/hr) a yr later.

As a 20 year old, Carnegie mortgaged his family’s home to YOLO everything on the Adams Express Company in 1855, his very first investment, a railroad that gave 20% dividend every month, which made him an investing god among his social circle.

He then used those profits to YOLO everything on the Woodruff sleeping car company (inventor of the sleeping car) before IPO, getting a 12.5% stake, arranged a merger with Pullman in 1860, and 
profited again.

He used these profits to YOLO everything again on the Columbia Oil Company in 1864, which yielded $30 million (in 2020 money) in cash dividends in 1 year.

He used these profits to YOLO again and set up a steel rolling mill and ironworks, which he eventually sold to JP Morgan for $300 billion (his share was $7 billion, all 2020 money).

Then he gave all his billions away to establish libraries, museums, universities, scholarship funds, etc. just like ppl on WSB giving gold to random retards.

His favorite quote was: “Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket. Do not scatter your shot... The great successes of life are made by concentration.”

The original genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist and a true YOLOer at heart."
