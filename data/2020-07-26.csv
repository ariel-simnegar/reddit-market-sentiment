2020-07-27 11:40:24,Leaky_Buns,9,"If you think you are too late to the TSM game, keep this in mind.

In late 2019, TSM announced a CapEx increase of 40%. That means they increased the amount they spend to invest in things such as new facilities and R&D. They have also committed to this increased spending throughout 2020.

This was the main reason why this stock was kinda flat with super low IV for awhile. Because people thought they were using too much of their profit on CapEx.

Now this investment is starting to pay off way more than anyone ever imagined. Keep in mind that while the U.S. had to initially shutdown for a bit and then now operates on reduced capacity, Taiwan has been almost totally coronavirus free and during this time, they have been constantly improving their capabilities. This is on top of all the other problems that Intel has been facing before coronavirus.


This is not a stock that will stay under $100 for long. 

Personally I am buying 2022 leaps, selling once in the money and then rerolling them into higher strikes, while reinvesting the profits into more leaps and shares. On any significant dip, I‚Äôm just gonna add more positions.

Good luck to all."

Housing market. Seems to be booming in a lot of areas, homes selling like hotcakes for over the asking prices. Why? How? Banks are coming out hot with loans? To who?

ALL - calls (less driving, less claims)

NDLS - puts (when did you buy noodles from a restaurant during quarantine?)

8/5:

CVNA - puts (who the fuck buying a car from a vending machine?)

TWNK - calls (stress eating)

ELF - puts (no clubs, no makeup)

8/6:

AMC - puts (movie theaters are a thing of the past)
