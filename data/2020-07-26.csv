2020-07-27 11:40:24,Leaky_Buns,9,"If you think you are too late to the TSM game, keep this in mind.

In late 2019, TSM announced a CapEx increase of 40%. That means they increased the amount they spend to invest in things such as new facilities and R&D. They have also committed to this increased spending throughout 2020.

This was the main reason why this stock was kinda flat with super low IV for awhile. Because people thought they were using too much of their profit on CapEx.

Now this investment is starting to pay off way more than anyone ever imagined. Keep in mind that while the U.S. had to initially shutdown for a bit and then now operates on reduced capacity, Taiwan has been almost totally coronavirus free and during this time, they have been constantly improving their capabilities. This is on top of all the other problems that Intel has been facing before coronavirus.


This is not a stock that will stay under $100 for long. 

Personally I am buying 2022 leaps, selling once in the money and then rerolling them into higher strikes, while reinvesting the profits into more leaps and shares. On any significant dip, I‚Äôm just gonna add more positions.

Good luck to all."

Housing market. Seems to be booming in a lot of areas, homes selling like hotcakes for over the asking prices. Why? How? Banks are coming out hot with loans? To who?

 Monday 7/27

F5 Networks , Hasbro , and SAP report quarterly results.

The Census Bureau releases the Durable Goods report for June. Expectations are for a 5.5% rise in new orders for durable manufactured goods, to $205 billion, after a 15.7% jump in May.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reports its Texas Manufacturing Outlook survey for July. Economists forecast a reading of just above zero, continuing the index's rebound from records lows in March and April.

Tuesday 7/28

3M , Advanced Micro Devices , Altria Group , Amgen , eBay , McDonald's , MSCI , Mondelez International , Pfizer , Raytheon Technologies , S&P Global , Starbucks , and Visa report earnings.

The Conference Board releases its Consumer Confidence Index for June. Consensus estimate is for a 95.5 reading, slightly below May's 98.1.

Wednesday 7/29

The Federal Open Market Committee announces its monetary policy decision. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates near zero through 2022.

Boeing , Crown Castle International , Facebook , General Electric , Norfolk Southern , PayPal Holdings , Qualcomm , Sanofi , and Shopify report quarterly results.

The National Association of Realtors releases its Pending Home Sales Index for June. The index is seen rising 5.4% to a 105 reading, after a record spike of 44.3% in May.

Thursday 7/30

Alphabet , Amazon.com , American Tower , Apple , Comcast , ConocoPhillips , Electronic Arts , Eli Lilly , Ford Motor , Gilead Sciences , Moody's , Newmont , Northrop Grumman , Procter & Gamble , and United Parcel Service hold conference calls to discuss earnings.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports gross domestic product for the second quarter. Consensus estimate is for a decline of 34%, after a 5% fall in the first quarter. The largest quarterly drop recorded was 10% for the first three months of 1958. The BEA's release will probably confirm the end of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in June of 2009.

Friday 7/31

AbbVie , Caterpillar , Charter Communications , Chevron , Colgate-Palmolive , Exxon Mobil , Merck , Phillips 66 , and Under Armour report earnings.

The Institute for Supply Management releases its Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for July. Economists forecast a 42 reading, above June's 36.6 but still below the expansionary level of 50, which the index hasn't surpassed since last summer.

The BEA reports personal income and spending for June. Expectations for a 3% decline in income and a 6% jump in spending. This compares with a 4.2% drop and a 8.2% gain, respectively, in May.

If Fed introduces yield curve control program this week, followings might happen:

\- Bond market will get its investor back, we won't see an inverted yield anymore

\- Gold, Silver will have a big correction ahead

\- Stock market might have a correction as bond investors will move from stocks to bonds again

\- DXY (USD) most likely gain as a result

Fed has no choice but to move with yield curve control program. They can't control inflation or interest rates in this environment to stop USD plunge.

2020-07-27 07:41:09,WSBest,-4,"Watching ‚ÄúThe Big Sick‚Äù

Pretty good movie. It‚Äôs social commentary on a Pakistani family living in the US. Centered around stand up comedy to take the edge off, it‚Äôs a pretty insightful look. Overall I think it‚Äôs pretty good.

However, this (pretty basic) plot device of his family disowning him if he doesn‚Äôt marry another Pakistani girl strikes a strange chord. It‚Äôs a silly semi sub-plot, still a driving part of the movie but imagine if they were white. The narrative changes from ‚Äòthat‚Äôs just how they are‚Äô to massive racial injustices. The truth is somewhere in the middle and I think nuance is a long forgotten trait.

Anyone else see this movie?"

The last week, July 20 ‚Äì July 26, has been the second bad week in a row for the new infection count across the EU 5, with cases increasing in all countries and by 50% in aggregate to the highest level since the end of May. As well as the significant spike in Spanish infections, which have increased by further 83% (after 106% last week), there are now large spikes in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, too."

Just like last week proved. So you start averaging in on some gold/silver puts, yes puts, because when equities make a correction, they should take a dip with them. You don't go hard, just like a 10-20% take in puts imo.  
Then Tuesday you load up on SQQQ calls, continue averaging in come Wednesday unless we start the downtrend.  
Wednesday you load SPY puts (current - 5 points) for Friday and plan to sell them later that day or Thursday. Possible average in further SQQQ strikes if your current ones are hitting.  
Thursday you chill out, maybe load more SPY puts but carefully.  
Friday you collect SQQQ and any left over SPY puts. We end EOW ~302.

Sorry edit: You sell your gold/silver puts Wednesday or Thursday. Then switch into heavy calls for either or LEAPs and expect that shit to go to the moon."

>City Hall wants to charge landlords usurious penalties (up to 18 percent) for late payments. Team de Blasio even texted council members during the debate on Yeger‚Äôs amendment, urging them to resist.

>‚ÄúThis Kalman floor amendment is crazy,‚Äù read one text obtained by The Post. ‚ÄúIt will bankrupt the city and we will have no money for services.‚Äù

>Councilman Peter Koo charged that City Hall seems to see property owners as a cash cow.

>‚ÄúBuilding owners want to meet their obligation of paying property taxes, but they just need more time,‚Äù said the Rent Stabilization Association‚Äôs Frank Ricci.

>Why single out property owners for pain, when the city is easing up on everyone else who has been hit hard by the pandemic and lockdown?

>With tenants given a rent moratorium, how are landlords to find cash for taxes?

>‚ÄúThe fairest big city in America‚Äù wants to slam its largest providers of affordable housing simply because they‚Äôre landlords.

>(The Center Square) ‚Äì New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday he would not raise property taxes in order to get approval from state leaders to borrow money to fill a $1 billion budget shortfall.

>The pledge came a day before New York City must approve a budget for the fiscal year that starts Wednesday.

>De Blasio, in response to a reporter‚Äôs question about the property tax issue, said it was ‚Äútotally inaccurate‚Äù to say he was willing to raise taxes in order to get concessions from lawmakers. To the contrary, the mayor said he put it in writing that the city had no intention to do that.

>‚ÄúThe State Assembly was there with us every step of the way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to thank Speaker Carl Heastie and members of the Assembly. They were ready to come to the aid of New York City in our hour of need. The Senate was not. So, we move forward.‚Äù

>Without the ability to borrow money or get COVID-19 relief funding from Washington, de Blasio has said that job cuts, up to 22,000, would happen in the fall.

>‚ÄúHopefully, we can find a way with labor to avert layoffs,‚Äù de Blasio said. ‚ÄúIt's not a given. If we can't find a way, then Oct. 1 is when that would begin.‚Äù"

33 years old in Georgia

Depressed for your entire life starting at 8 years old

On and off medications for the past 25 years with no success

Currently 50k in student debt, and a teacher making 42k a year.

1k to my name and not getting paid again for over a month

start with 7k in Rhood in March, turn it into 30k June 8th, let all options expire worthless July 17th and currently have $500 in Robinhood. 

Any hopes of moving out and trying to better myself crushed

Never had a girlfriend.

Have no friends. Talk to none of my family members (in different states and all druggies)

Rent a room in a trailer covered in piss and shit and dishes to the sink 24/7 because it's the only thing I can afford. Make 'too much' money where I live to rent any apartments. 

Any time I try to lose weight, 3 days later I find myself crying in a Mcdonalds or Taco Bell drive-thru line.

Heart condition means I could die if my heart rates goes above 130. 

Only thing that makes me smile is knowing that none of this is permanent, and no matter what I'll die one day. 

Constant heart palpatations at night that give me insomnia, doctors have no idea why. 

Diagnosed with depression, ADD, and bipolar. 

4 inch penis.

Unable to focus or apply myself

Bullish scenario: 320.58-322.09 as support still. Look for 324.50+ to hold into tonight/tomm. 326.82 is a key level. To bust through 327, we will need high volume push this time around. Attempted lots of times last week. Next gap is straight to 332.59 üöÄ

Bearishü©∏: $FB, very important. If MSFT had great earnings but went down, watch what FB does for big earnings on Thursday (AMZN AAPL GOOG). Look to break 318.95 down towards 317.65 and below. 315.50 is too strong. If we do break that, next leg to 312. Unload puts if we ever get down there.

2020-07-27 02:58:30,Deonneon,8,"A look at the week ahead of 7/27:

Stimulus Bill details revealed over the weekend and will be proposed on Monday. Expect a green open. They will be racing the clock to get agreement. Market is not convince everything will be passed by EOM and so some provisions of the old stimulus will expire.  Biggest earning week as most of tech reporting and Thursday is the worse. Volatility will be high closer to then.

- Monday, Stimulus bill is proposed.  Anything over $1.5 trill and market rally. No proposal = red
- Wednesday, FED FOMC meeting statement. No increase in interest rate
- Wednesday, Tech giants testify to Congress on antitrust/monopoly
- Perhaps China may retaliate due to recent embassy drama, perhaps.

Anyone who thinks the bill will take much longer or tech earning expectation are too high should buy Vix puts/QQQ puts. Silver and Gold are skyrocketing with this bill.

Key Data Release

- Thursday, Q2 GDP report
- Thursday, Unemployment Claims"

We're inflating internationally. The USD is toilet paper to other countries due to the fed's actions. And now, because the American consumer, doesn't really have extra money, we're going to be FUCKED. Prices of imported goods are going to go higher and our relative spending is going to be the same or go down so the discrepancy between prices is going to FUCKKKK USSSSSSS.

I've cashed out my initial and some of my profits and bought everything I wanted, but even that didn't make me happy. 

So, on Friday, I sold all my options and leaps, went all in on shares, metals, etc. and deleted the app. Part of the reason trading doesn't make me happy these days is that I haven't hung out with anyone since January. Still, WSB and trading keep me occupied throughout the depressing COVID situation and I learned a lot about the markets.  

I'm gonna spend the rest of the night summarizing some of my half finished finance books and then log off Reddit for good. Next time I come back, I'll be happier, healthier, better than ever, or I won't be back at all.

So UE+ ends and now we have this next stimulus bill in discussion. How long did the last stimulus check take to go out to everybody? A month? Two?  
What do you think people are going to do with that $1200 if they haven't worked or received any money in the past week? Let alone a month?  
Think they throw it into the stock market... or throw it into rent and food and probably save it because who knows what's going to happen in the next month...  
I know.. we're all stoked that Yay!! $1200!! But... we have millions that are about to have ZERO income. And those people could be broke... not until the stimulus bill passes... but until it passes and it all starts getting issued out and received. So we can tack on probably 2-4 weeks AFTER the stimulus bill passes for those people to have their situation temporarily remedied.

In early 2000s, banks switched to ‚Äúoriginate and distribute‚Äù model. Loans were held for a few days till they were sold to investment banks who assembled packages of these mortgages and issued mortgage backed securities - derivative bonds, which were sliced into different tranches with different claim priority against payments from the underlying mortgages and each with a different bond rating.

Even if the underlying loans were of bad quality, the bond rating agencies were happy to bestow a AAA rating on the bond tranches with first claims on the payments from underlying mortgages. This technique was employed with all sorts of underlying Instruments, such as credit card and automobile loans, and the derivative securities were sold all over the world.

Second order derivatives were sold on the derivative mortgage-backed bonds. Credit-default swaps were issued as insurance policies on the mortgage-backed bonds.

Holding a position ""long-term"" meant till later in the morning. People who would spend hours researching the pros and cons of a $50 appliance would risk tens of thousands of dollars on chat room tips.

Most internet traders lost money even while the stocks were going up, and they performed worse the more they traded. The average survival time was ~6 months."
