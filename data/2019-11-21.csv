2019-11-22 10:57:39,Fagatoli,12,"I don't mind the look of the cybertruck and applaud anything that tries to diverge from how boring cars have become. The price point is also surprisingly competitive... however, your sister-fucking truck guys (aka 90% of truck guys) aren't going to want to be caught dead in a pickup that looks like a Lara Croft tiddy from 1997."
2019-11-22 10:48:54,AmericanHerstoryX,3,"When I woke up and started my search for the truck unveil, before I even googled anything I just went to Twitter and I saw a picture of the truck with shattered windows (captioned: hahahahahaha) but I was like ""that's not even a truck idk what that is but clearly that's either a meme or something else entirely."" Was surely disappointed when I found out that actually was the truck. So weird looking it just left me confused.

My confusion hasn't faded, I can't imagine someone owning something like that yet, but the more I look at it the more I don't hate it. From a consumer standpoint I still don't like it, but it's starting to fascinate me from a general standpoint. It does look like something straight out of a sci fi movie.

As for the stock RIP my calls lmao how do I make this money back"

2019-11-22 10:39:29,GMUsername,3,"I didn’t like it at first, and I’m still kinda conflicted on the look but then I thought about it. This thing has the hype factor and we are living in the age of hype. And guess what? Hype sells. It’s like Supreme wear or AirPods. It doesn’t have to look great, it has to be iconic. It’s got that Back to the Future, Bladerunner movie appeal. When was the last time you were excited for a pickup truck reveal? Sure this truck doesn’t look like any other truck, but thats.the.point. If you pull-up next to me at a turn signal in one of these, I would be in awe of your window-shattering balls of steel. It’s got a bold design and there’s nothing else like it on the road. I see celebrities hopping out of these just to flex. This might just be the G wagon of the next decade. Sure Elon got on stage and made a fool of himself, but he’s never been good at presentations and hopefully he’ll take this as a lesson. But the truck itself has super car performance for the price of a half decent sedan and is still more functional than many other cars on the road. It has a great towing capacity and a full cab. It’ll be able to autonomously drive itself and has the advantage of the largest EV network available. I definitely think all the cool kids are going to be buying this."

The mods got me on some bogus trumped up political charge and then the big guys at reddit got me for suggesting some unkind things would happen to someone. Anyway I took care of the rat that sent me away. My facebook calls did well and my Boeing calls made money but not nearly as much as I had hoped. They’ve been good for swing trades back and forth though. My latest move was twitter calls I picked a few up yesterday I wanted to mention it. 1/17/2020 were so cheap on Twitter I barely had time to buy any though. I’m up 27% and I may get into more. I got a price target on Twitter at 33 per share. My strike is 30 I am very confident in this move making me 100%. Mods are all gay, fuck rats!"

So if you want to make better trades, just stick one of these babies on about an hour before trading. Your mind will be clearer, filled with less testosterone, and you'll make better trades!

2019-11-21 21:10:29,Brendenlow,11,"I make the dumbest fucking moves and never capitalize on a win. This is the third time I have been up 300% or more and tried to make a move in another position only to watch it evaporate. 

Swing trade wins on roku and AMD this week and turned $600 into $4000. 

Then switched to AMD and BJ’s calls at close yesterday and they both dropped like a rock. BJs immediately went to $0 and doesn’t expire for a month so I have to look at it everyday as a reminder of my stupidity. 

In FD spy calls with the remaining balance so here’s hoping to a resolution to the trade war overnight otherwise I am toast and my kids won’t get Christmas gifts"

**The Conference Board Leading Economic Index®** (LEI)for  theU.S. declined 0.1 percent in October to 111.7 (2016 = 100),  following a 0.2 percent decline in both September and August.

“The US LEI declined for a third consecutive month, and its six-month  growth rate turned negative for the first time since May 2016. The  decline was driven by weaknesses in new orders for manufacturing,  average weekly hours, and unemployment insurance claims,” said Ataman  Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at The Conference  Board. “The major difference this month is the softening in the labor  market, whereas conditions in manufacturing remain weak and show no  signs of improvement yet. Taken together, the LEI suggests that the  economy will end the year on a weak note, at just below 2 percent  growth.”"
