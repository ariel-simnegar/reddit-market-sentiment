2019-11-22 10:57:39,Fagatoli,14,"I don't mind the look of the cybertruck and applaud anything that tries to diverge from how boring cars have become. The price point is also surprisingly competitive... however, your sister-fucking truck guys (aka 90% of truck guys) aren't going to want to be caught dead in a pickup that looks like a Lara Croft tiddy from 1997."
2019-11-22 10:48:54,AmericanHerstoryX,3,"When I woke up and started my search for the truck unveil, before I even googled anything I just went to Twitter and I saw a picture of the truck with shattered windows (captioned: hahahahahaha) but I was like ""that's not even a truck idk what that is but clearly that's either a meme or something else entirely."" Was surely disappointed when I found out that actually was the truck. So weird looking it just left me confused.

My confusion hasn't faded, I can't imagine someone owning something like that yet, but the more I look at it the more I don't hate it. From a consumer standpoint I still don't like it, but it's starting to fascinate me from a general standpoint. It does look like something straight out of a sci fi movie.

As for the stock RIP my calls lmao how do I make this money back"

2019-11-22 10:39:29,GMUsername,5,"I didn’t like it at first, and I’m still kinda conflicted on the look but then I thought about it. This thing has the hype factor and we are living in the age of hype. And guess what? Hype sells. It’s like Supreme wear or AirPods. It doesn’t have to look great, it has to be iconic. It’s got that Back to the Future, Bladerunner movie appeal. When was the last time you were excited for a pickup truck reveal? Sure this truck doesn’t look like any other truck, but thats.the.point. If you pull-up next to me at a turn signal in one of these, I would be in awe of your window-shattering balls of steel. It’s got a bold design and there’s nothing else like it on the road. I see celebrities hopping out of these just to flex. This might just be the G wagon of the next decade. Sure Elon got on stage and made a fool of himself, but he’s never been good at presentations and hopefully he’ll take this as a lesson. But the truck itself has super car performance for the price of a half decent sedan and is still more functional than many other cars on the road. It has a great towing capacity and a full cab. It’ll be able to autonomously drive itself and has the advantage of the largest EV network available. I definitely think all the cool kids are going to be buying this."
