2019-11-26 21:56:45,scroogemcdub,3,I’d probably go calls on TEVA. Went through their earnings call transcript and they had already mentioned this subpoena in Q3. Absolutely zero news was a surprise. Just MMs getting weak handed people to drop their shares given better price points. We’ve known about the issue for quite some time and it’s not as bad as a 10% loss of share price. My two cents from reviewing the subpoena and the earnings transcripts
