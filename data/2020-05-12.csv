Obviously if you grew up here you were literally raised on shots of Germans getting roasted and blown up so we hate those fucks. And then the French were ok like 300 years ago but now we just think they are pussies. And then the british. Textbooks make you look like the biggest clowns of all for getting beat by some ragtag group of alcoholic farmers. Not sure if any of it's true but that's what's taught😂 oh and Italians were good until the Romans moved north and the guinea wops in Sicily took over

September 17, 2019 – three months before the first coronavirus case was reported anywhere in the world – the liquidity at the biggest banks on Wall Street was so bad that the Fed had to intervene in the overnight loan market (repo loans) and begin making hundreds of billions of dollars in loans each week.

They have 460m in series D funding. One of their biggest backers are the  **Agnelli family**  ""the Kennedys of Italy."" who own the Fiat empire and  Juventes football club (Former owners of Ferrari). 

Not to mention the US department of energy was the first to give them a grant. 

They have 10,000 pre-orders. Most of which were made by Anheuser-Busch to create a zero emission fleet in the next 5 years. These pre-orders include upgrade costs, software and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, worth 10B+ in product and service revenues.

The only thing you should be worried about is if this really is shell that they will do the reverse take over with. 

My best guess is yes, considering the the current VTIQ CEO is an ex GM boss man with years of wisdom in automotive industry (Stephen  J. Girsky).

**Why to Buy**: revolve (RVLV) was reporting 20% YOY sales growth in Jan and Feb, on march 20th revised guidance and haven’t made an update since. site traffic search shows they had the same level of traffic and actually more traffic than january and february in april through may via Alexa.com , Similarweb.com . they are a profitable company with a strong balance sheet (last reported they had 85M cash) there’s major short interest (40%) of which only 3% was squeezed on friday leading to a massive 32% jump from the stock. if the stock beats earnings which are estimated to be 0.04 for the quarter which is a whopping 1/3 of their previous quarter’s EPS, the stock has potential to skyrocket based on Wayfair’s incredible success in the past couple of weeks. they are a fully online women’s designer clothing retail that uses the full force of instagram influencers to help market their site and products, plus they even had their own episode on the bachelor where they advertised revolve hard, which definitely contributed to lots of sales. people have been spending their checks and they haven’t been investing, some of it went to clothing. the sector of ecommerce / clothing on BAC’s report showed a near full recovery by april. RVLV will persevere even if spy drops again tomorrow. check their tagged posts on Instagram, over 900+ posts in a day just yesterday with revolve clothing and that’s just from instagram, not off facebook or twitter. on top of that if you do the math they’re growing at a rate of 8% versus 3% analyst estimates, and by march 20th were on the up trend. january and february were 20% YoY growth. they have strong balance sheets as i’ve said before and they reduced salaries and cut operating costs, this thing will move up to the 20’s after earnings buy 15 C for June or go higher strike if you want to risk it, insane play that i’ve put a bunch of money into and i’m ready."

It then begins to retrace the pattern from the previous day. Each candle disappears with every passing minute. You know exactly what's going to happen because the charts right in front of you. You buy options. You continue this everyday. Once you make back everything you've ever lost, the market stops. You think it's frozen again. Refresh. The SPY starts trading to the right again.

2020-05-13 05:04:33,chadimmaculate,-2,"SPY is having a hard time breaking through $294, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the top of the bear rally. 

[“Foreign tourists”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/6C69C77E-940E-11EA-8863-17EFDBF36C53) should continue to buy dips until major negative catalysts occur in the coming months and uncertainty increases. Once SPY breaks through $294, the early $300s is the next wall. It could take longer here as the bear rally loses steam, but one final push past last year’s wall is where the bear rally could die, right around where it seems like a V-shaped recovery is certain and the outlook is improving.

Doesn’t mean we’ll see March lows again this year, but the bear rally isn’t dying anytime soon."

Last night I posted about why the cruise industry is a really bad play right now.     


All y'all talking about the economy reopening are full of shit.  You all have forgotten about the albatross known as public education.  


Numerous school districts are already whispering about digital school in the fall at least until Christmas.  These kids already struggle socioeconomically.   These districts are underfunded as fuck, my district is literally giving kids chromebooks that are vastly underpowered and they will be pawned in a week with zero repercussions.  Districts are paying for unlimited hotspots for families. ( backordered until who knows when )  


Parents can't go back to work in the same fashion until the kids go back to school.   And k-6 kids aren't going back anytime soon.  


(You will see a paradigm shift in 7-12 education with a focus on online education.   Look for beat down stocks in that division for growth, Pearson, LRN, et al)"

My  bet is that if he did soften significantly on negative rates, it would  spook the market further. Anybody with a brain would say, ""Given his  record on negative rates, only way he considers this is if the economy  is actually in worse shape than he thought even just a month ago."" I  don't see it happening.

I don't  see him announcing any major changes tomorrow that pop the market. He'll  give more information about the current programs, progress, details,  maybe some longer term guidance and sense of where things are headed.  But I don't see much he could say where people would go ""what, really?!  That's a buy signal""."

2020-05-13 03:58:45,pron_site_operator,5,/ES is touching the expected value on the downside at 2853.75 as calculated at the close last Friday.  This week's expected move in SPX was only about +/- 80 points which I think was under priced for a VIX at about 30.  The market has been pricing in SPX options pretty well over the last few weeks but we still got 3 days left in the week and we already traded outside of the lower end of the expected move.

2020-05-13 03:39:28,xesus2019,11,"Take a 30yr UST issued in 2000; it has 10yrs left on it. Whatever it’s coupon is, it will be trading at a premium (above $100) such that it’s yield is equal to the 10yr mkt yield of 0.66% (appx $113). ‘Old’ treasuries are called off-the-run and they serve as a reference to fresh treasuries of comparable term called ‘on-the-run’.

When the UST auctions treasuries, they do it by PRICE, not by yield. So for a 10yr auction, the UST will say, “we are offering $40B of 10yr 2% coupon bonds. Submit your bids by 2pm.” (Note: the UST offers coupons, generally, above market yields such that they expect bonds exit the auction at a premium.)

Everyone blindly submits their bids, and 99.9% of the time the price that dealers bid will imply a ‘settled yield’ within ~10-15bps of the market yield to a comparable UST. In this case, it will be about $113 per $100 of face. The yield gap implied by the auction settled price is called the settled spread. You might also hear it called the ‘on-run, off-run’ spread. In normal times this spread is fairly small bc there are a shit load of arb guys that keep this narrow.

Ok, so what happens if the new bids come in at, say, $110 due to lower demand? In that case the settled spread would be 0.95% or ~20bps spread to mkt, which is a lot. This would cause some heart burn bc it implies that auctions are getting wobbly. By ‘wobbly’ I mean that dealer/investor demand for new treasuries is getting incrementally weaker. What were to happen if bids settled at $104? That would imply a settled yield of 1.54%, which is a lot.

The broader thing is that all rates are connected by existing treasuries and futures/fwds on rates, so that would cause the whole term structure to jump up, and all rates are going (a lot) higher. But the larger point is that auction demand to finance our debt is sliding away, meaning that the Fed/UST go from setting rates to taking rates, and that all rates are going up, and future auctions are going to come in requiring more yield.

2020-05-13 03:37:55,xesus2019,4,"Too much cash is what induces rates higher. Remember that for a sovereign, ‘debt’ is just ‘cash + an implied rate forward’; printing debt is the same as printing cash.

As debt carry costs go up, the US has to print more debt to cover incremental borrowing costs, which amplifies the inflationary cycle - this is called ‘monetizing debt.’ The govt could cut spending, which is deflationary, but this has historically been (close to) politically impossible.

Inflation leads rates, reduced capital spending is disinflationary; however, a healthy chunk remains bc ‘labor’ is far more subject to inflation than equipment (eg, think about a factory that replaces 5 people with a machine. The labor will demand raises every year; just about all of the cost associated w the machine is largely inflation resistant.) Construction spending is an outlier and can be weird during inflationary environments. So TLDR, there are certainly some pockets of deflation, but inflation + limited real growth ‘wins’.

The best limited-scale test run is when the US left Bretton-Woods in the early 70s and fully floated the USD. What we got was appx 10 years of stagflation punctuated by waves of minirecessions."

$285k wiped from your home: Bank’s prediction 

Yahoo Finance AU12 May 2020, 10:02 pm GMT-4

> Home prices will tumble 32 per cent over a prolonged downturn period, the Commonwealth Bank has warned.

> In Sydney, where the median house price is $889,992, that fall will wipe $284,798 from the median home value by March 2023.

> And across Australia, where the median price is $555,739, a correction of this magnitude would wipe $177,837 from the median home value."

I lost 7k in options on robinhood last year, so I quit trading. I thought corona as a opportunity and got back in last month, initially i did good and made some money, but then my RETARDNESS kicked in and I lost 1k more in Boeing options, I did options again even after promising I won't touch them unless for hedging and that too after considerable research 

Total loss now is 8k

After that I had 25k worth of stocks, again RETARDNESS kicked in I actually used 4x margin with a 7k account 

Today I lost 1k more totalling my loss till date 9.2k 

I sold 10k worth of positions on after hours, now it looks like we might be green tomorrow who knows.

2020-05-13 00:23:27,ethereumkid,4,"Cold hard truth is that post-covid, there will be jobs that won’t come back. Companies are going to try their hardest to trim down their workforce and automate whatever they can. 

It’s not a partisan issue on who can work or not. Downsizing will have an effect on everyone. It’s retarded to hear a Trumper complain about “the libs” not wanting the stay-at-home orders lifted. I can guarantee you that in a city like LA, a majority of people are “the libs”. I’m sure a majority of them would like to get back to work if they could safely. 

If you’re dying to get to work, grocery stores and delivery jobs are in demand. Go get work there. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. Demand for everything non-essential is practically zero right now anyway and will stay that way until big corporations have the confidence that their workforce isn’t in danger. 

Also, I wonder how many of those protestors are making more with unemployment now compared to when they actually worked. 

It’s going to take a while to stabilize a new normal. No need to add oil to the fire by being retarded monkeys screaming “own the libs”. Workers from both sides were hit."

I think what they should be doing is allowing max pain to be now so that old businesses that can't survive now die out while new businesses rise from the ashes and bring the economy roaring back in a few years. This also wouldn't require trillions upon trillions of dollars of stimulus to support the pre-corona economy. This isn't a small amount! It would just be a matter of allowing the economy to evolve into a post-corona economy.

Obviously this doesn't work out for everyone (I know there will be a ton of pain going around right now if this happens), especially the older generation, but what we're doing now doesn't work out for everyone too. There will be a lot more hindered growth in the future due to what the government is doing.

I really don't agree with daddy pow pow's moves."

I walk up and everyone visibly got uncomfortable because of how cool I was. I walked up and said, ""syocks"" because sometimes when I get excited I sort of combine words. What I meant to say was ""you stock?"" Which I clarified 3 minutes later to the bartender.
Anyways, they continued talking about stocks except instead of tickers they kept saying fund names. This made me angry so I said, ""fucking options or mysuck dick."" Which I guess sounded like I was offering a blow job, but I was just getting excited and said that instead of suck my dick.
So after I said that a few of them made a few good natured jokes and pointed at whoever was behind me. A few jokes later they all sort of realized I was more experienced and we're probably worried I'd steal their wives if they saw my dick or tendies so they went to a different part of the bar to continue their conversation. I think one of them farted as they left because when I took a deep sniff it smelled like defeat. Their defeat."

If we hit SPY $276 before 5/22, I'll pick up some 7/17 SPY $280 calls. Then, I'll write the same amount of $285 calls with a 2 week expiry date. Unless I get assigned (which would be fine, as I would benefit from $9 of delta), I can write those $285 calls 3 times before my position expires. Will plan to close the long call and buy back the short if SPY goes below $270.

If we hit $292 again, I'll do the same, but with buying a $288p and selling $284p's, and I'll pull the escape pin at $296.

It's basically a diagonal spread. Do you guys think this is a good strategy for our current environment? It seems we're range-bound between $275 and $295 for the next few weeks."

***CSCO*** still holding. Bought on Friday AM so I am still up about 30%, but at one point I was up like 60% today. Hoping for a run-up so I can dump before ER tomorrow AH

***8x8*** calls probably shit the bed, still got my fingers crossed on CYBR earnings beat for tomorrow AM (both were around $800 positions). Happy with their earnings beat tho

***CYBR*** riding through ER. Was up a little from this morning but went down hard at EOD. Holding, probably will liquidate tomorrow depending on ER (pre-market tomorrow)

***NET...*** I was able to make some fuckin money off today. Sold my NET baghold from earnings and actually made $500 toal on NET, up from -$6500 this morning. Got lucky and sold at the high.

***AAPL*** calls, I panic dumped them and saved a ton of money, only lost like $200 or so which was fucking clutch. Would have lost like $3k if I had held I think. Was up but glad I didn't lose much

***SDC***  caught the falling knife and opened calls at $.90 (EOD at $.75). Might double up tomorrow AM because they *should* run up to earnings

***TSLA***, I panic bought 20 shares at close today. Wanted options but pussied out. I think with Trumps tweet they will moon tomorrow but didn't want to gamble too much

***FB*** calls 6/19 EOD today. Hopefully not a fucking mistake. Will see in a few days.

***DDOG*** calls printed nicely!! 250% gain, sold at $69.69 for good luck

**Logi** shit the bed but I was able to recover most of my loss from the morning

***ZNGA*** calls into earnings finally went from .01 to .00 which was funny. Small position - not even worth my time to liquidate the position, just let it expire I guess

**Watchlist for tomorrow;**

TSLA, NVDA, Maybe try another AAPL/AMD scalp if it feels right

Looking for an entry to DKNG also, want to see if it drops overnight.

Maybe WMT, HD if I feel like they are going to run up (need to decide tonight).

Bulls at the time were in denial that anything could end the Bull Market. Then, Bears seized the idea that this *must* go lower than 2019 lows. It’s *worse*! *”Worse than 2008!”*

But they didn’t account for unlimited QE throwing an emergency brake onto the freefalling liquidity crisis panic elevator. 

I’m not sure what happens now. It seems that we’re at the point where it’s extremely obvious reopening will not go smoothly and may result in reimplementing shutdowns. 

Will this cause a panic? Maybe not this time around. Governments have shown they’re willing to throw whatever it takes to cushion the blow from shutdowns if there’s no other choice. 

A treatment/vaccine is still months or maybe a year away, but months closer than it was back in March, with the timeline shrunken by expedited processes and massive investment."

It's really not easy to uncap shale wells for an extended period of time. Trump must've played hardball with MBS. 

On the flipside, some shale drillers started to uncap their wells again because WTI hit $25 (and keeping it capped would fuck up the well). Also, API crude inventory numbers are still building up (higher than expected). It's likely that demand is not picking up as expected, as people are furloughed and sit at home, keep working from home and industries need time to ramp up production. So maybe American oil fucked themselves to death? We'll see in a few days."

In other words, we are in a bubble. Now it's a matter of trying to predict whether companies will be able to grow back into that bubble when the economy opens up or if they'll fail to, causing the bubble to pop.

I suspect that after Congress sorts out its more immediate issues with relief and stimulus bills, there will be a more proactive solution in the works to address some of our economy's underlying issues: such as stock buybacks. If the SEC returns to it's pre-Reagan policies which all but stopped buybacks, we could potentially see slower but more stable stock growth over the next ten years, and greater/wider economic growth outside of Wall Street. That said, this is eerily similar to the speculation after the Great Recession in 2008, after which of course stock buybacks did slow down before escalating to all-time highs just recently in late 2019 (I'm talking 90+% of profits in many companies). So who knows... 

I sure don't, which is why I'm just shifting to holding shares for now..."

Why? If they stay the same in the next 2 weeks it's a free $7,000. If they go up it's a free $14,000. 

There will be no reason the airlines get anything but good news (in the next two weeks at least). Deaths are going down (tests are going up because we are testing more, but you can't ignore a death you CAN ignore a sick person and not test them). Deaths lag 2 weeks behind cases, so cases have actually been going down for about 2 weeks. Even if the reopen goes to shit, it's not going to go to shit that quickly because the disease doesn't spread that quickly.

+Drive through testing is getting to smaller and smaller towns.

+People WANT to fly but they don't want to fly somewhere where everything is closed, people aren't afraid they are booking freaking carnival cruises FFS. 

+All the airline has to do is explain how the cabins work and how they have ALWAYS been built to circulate air DOWN and not recirculate or go horizontal and people will feel better. People don't know this.

Not to mention if they have everyone wear masks and do antibody testing at the gate or at the very least temperature testing? It'll be fine.

There is no logical reason that airlines will go LOWER than they were before they knew if they'd get a government bailout or not especially by 5/29.

It's not a glorious 20x return YOLO bet, but i'll take a GUARANTEED $14,000 any day of the week."

1) We can get more memory/computation in a click. 

2) All of your data is stored on a distributed system. No more risk for data corruption. Can have three or four laptops for very cheap that all connect to the same VM being streamed through servers. Think Google Stadia.

3) < 2lb laptops and foldable devices (the only thing you need is a small circuit board, some ram, display card, and wifi card, this can condense laptops by a huge order of magnitude).

4) We would pay a subscription fee for an online streamed VM, not the laptops or hardware. This means we can access it anywhere, including smart devices, like on a TV for example.
