2020-05-13 09:56:41,JefBezosExWifesNewBF,4,It's funny how from the earliest age we are taught that Europoors are cucks😂. Obviously if you grew up here you were literally raised on shots of Germans getting roasted and blown up so we hate those fucks. And then the French were ok like 300 years ago but now we just think they are pussies. And then the british. Textbooks make you look like the biggest clowns of all for getting beat by some ragtag group of alcoholic farmers. Not sure if any of it's true but that's what's taught😂 oh and Italians were good until the Romans moved north and the guinea wops in Sicily took over

2020-05-13 09:41:46,Dmoan,-2,FOMO is in full force trying to grab as much as they can on this dip & slowly expect it to push up to 290. As I keep pointing out FOMO is not going let market drop below 283 resistance and we are goin to keep rallying every time we hit that. Unless there is real bad news due to covid which I don’t expect this month.
