2020-05-28 09:04:02,randomcluster,3,"In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every mobile phone of my peoples, the autists on this very same forum, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.

For the third time in the lives of most of us we are at war. Many of you are only 1 score and 5 to 9 years old, but nonetheless, from 2001 to 2008 and now, with a new invisible enemy, in 2020, the threat emerges again. 

Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies. These central bankers, and their dark magic, have sought to destroy us all. Bulls and bears both, we are in their sights. But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.  


It is the principle which permits a state, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other states.  


Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that ""might is right""; and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. But far more than this -- the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended.  


This is the ultimate issue which confronts us. For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.  


It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.

If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.

May JPoww spare our poor souls, and perhaps bless and keep us all."

People wanna live like this in their cars and big fuckin' houses they can't even pay for, then you're necessary. The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is cause we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really fuckin' fair really fuckin' quickly and nobody actually wants that. They say they do but they don't. They want what we have to give them but they also wanna, you know, play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. Well, thats more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow, so fuck em. Fuck normal people. You know, the funny thing is, tomorrow if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong, and everything gets back on track? Well then, the same people are gonna laugh till they piss their pants cause we're gonna all look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door.

Consolidated around the highs last week and had a bullish breakout to 3000, nasdaq beginning to trend back down while small cap value stocks pick up. Big money is in the blue chip and growth stocks, if we see more selling from NQ it could signal an early sign of reversal. Not to say calls aren‚Äôt on the menu, but be careful! A break under 3000 can trigger a move down to 2728. Small caps may still have more room to run but everyone knows the majority of small caps are at more risk of insolvency from the crisis therefor they may not hold up much longer."

If you're educated and well off to begin with. I used to be a programmer making a very comfortable wage and had friends in the same field. I've since moved home to live with my parents to support their restaurant business. I didn't get the 1200 check cause I claimed on my taxes that my parents could claim me as a dependent in an attempt to save them some tax money... Instead all it meant was I was not eligible for the 1200 AND my parents didn't get an extra 500 cause I'm over 21 or whatever the nonsensical cutoff is. Meanwhile my minimum wage working at my parents is a real struggle while their business takes a massive hit from Corona and my friends are jerking off at home during work hours making near 6 figures and getting the 1200$..

This rally reminds me of the Bitcoin peak in late-2017. Everyone is a buyer, everyone is convinced stocks can only go higher, everyone around me are opening brokerage accounts to take advantage of this ‚Äúonce in a lifetime opportunity‚Äù...

I hear the arguments that 1) yields are so low, what else are you going to buy? 2) the Fed is pumping trillions 3) the market is forward-looking 4) the bounce has been fuelled by retail investors, there is a lot of cash sitting on the sideline waiting to be deployed by institutional buyers. I hear all that, and still... 

It feels like complacency for me. We don‚Äôt know yet what‚Äôs going to happen with a potential 2nd wave, US-China tensions can turn into something ugly, we have no idea how emerging markets are going to get out of the pandemic... And forward P/E ratios are at insane levels. And we‚Äôre in an election year!

Buy puts dated September or later and nothing sub 280 if you do feel bearish. If we do hit an elevator down early you get a huge VIX bump and can sell and get more aggressive. 

Best hopes for bears:

1) Unemployed choose to stay unemployed for government Tendies through July 

2) massive second wave (not sure if this would actually even matter) looking back to Spanish flu, the second wave was way deadlier than the first 

3) when unemployment checks stop on August 1 companies have gotten leaner and aren‚Äôt ready to hire more. Enter consumer spending plunge, mortgage foreclosures, etc. this would still take at least a month to set in.

If you think it‚Äôs just going to circuit breaker at random good luck but that‚Äôs stupid."

This should provide further fuel. As there are enough investors buying the dip in tech, a bounce past the previous  300-303 wall of 2019 is all but certain now. Things might move sideways for a bit after that, but whether it breaks up or down will some depend on the blend of minor and major uncertainties of fiscal policy, monetary policy, how COVID-19 transmission changes with the summer season, and how major state economies react.

Even without an unknown major catalyst bringing blood in the streets, we still may see a major rejection of 303+ before speculation brings valuations well above 303. I‚Äôll be buying any major dips until that catalyst comes, but somewhat cautiously."

USTR aims to stop all solar panel imports from China - statement 

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued a statement asserting the government agency ""strongly"" disagrees with a decision made by a judge of the Court of International Trade blocking USTR's attempt to eliminate all solar panels imports from China, including the previously allowed bifacial panels.

""USTR strongly disagrees with Judge Katzmann‚Äôs analysis. The solar industry and the jobs it represents are important to this country, and USTR will take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that its safeguard relief is effective,"" USTR noted. The statement went on to say the action made two years ago by US President Donald Trump to place ‚Äúsafeguard‚Äù restrictions on solar panel imports from the country ensured the protection od the nation's solar industry.

USTR claimed that despite initially making an exception for bifacial panels, after seeing a ""significant"" increase in imported panels the agency has vowed to take ""necessary"" action to stop all imports in order to make sure jobs of the United States citizens remain protected."

United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell (pictured) accused China on Wednesday of using the coronavirus outbreak to advance its political agenda, which includes passing the new Hong Kong national security law.

Stilwell warned that Washington ""will take action"" against Beijing in response to its Hong Kong actions. ""This is going to resonate not just in Hong Kong, but elsewhere,"" the diplomat told Voice of America. ""It's going to have impact in Southeast Asia. It's going to have impact with its neighbor India and others,"" he added.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said he will make an announcement on his ""powerful"" response to China's national security law by the end of the week, while Beijing warned it will retaliate in case the US imposes any punitive measures."

2020-05-27 22:59:18,one_eyed_johnny,7,"So to clarify my earlier comment about the easy dip play here it is. One of two things are about to happen so there's two different options either:

A: autist king actually signs the order. In this case wait until at least 3:30 tomorrow when the boomers catch up and load up on either Twitter or fb calls for early-mid August. Why august? Cuz that's about how long it'll take the courts to strike it down. I'd go with fb cuz Dorsey is more than likely to lose his cool over it and make things worse for himself.

B: he pussies out and doesn't sign it. In this case load up on regular old stock on either fb or Twitter at the end of the day tomorrow to give all the boomers time to catch up as they will sell anyways out of fear.

I am more confident about this play than I was about dkng and you guys didn't listen then either.

EDIT regular stocks are fine in situation a but calls will net mega tendies for timing"

State Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States is ending sanctions waivers that allow European and Chinese businesses to work at Iran's civilian nuclear facilities.

""Today, I am ending the sanctions waiver for JCPOA-related projects in Iran, effective in 60 days. Iran‚Äôs continued nuclear escalation makes clear this cooperation must end. Further attempts at nuclear extortion will only bring greater pressure on the regime,"" Pompeo said in a tweet.

Earlier in the month, media reported that the US renewed five of seven sanction waivers, extending them for a period between 45 to 90 days."

2020-05-27 20:52:16,BeardedMoroccan,4,"CANADA SUCKS - REASONS WHY :

Doesn't matter which city you're in, it's the same everywhere, but I personally live in Montreal.

1-Don't even dream of buying a house with a backyard here unless you are a millionaire or willing to live in a village in the middle of nowhere. Real estate is crazy expensive, and it's not even worth it. Like who's the dumbass that will pay 800k for a 3 bedroom house that was built 100 years ago ? Well some people in Canada I guess...  
Houses are old and built with the cheapest material ever, so whenever we have a storm here, the internet fills up with pictures of houses with no roof

2- Canadian dollar is a joke, it's worthless, so whenever you travel you are 30% poorer.

3- Job market is crap - They keep talking about IT jobs etc.. but what they don't say is that it's shitty tech support that they outsourced from New York to Montreal, as it's cheaper for big companies. Jobs are really not interesting in Canada, unless you live in Toronto ( and even then.. )

4- Weather is the worst

5- Homeless people are literally everywhere. I have never seen so many homeless people in my life. They are also crazy agressive with women, they follow them and insult them ( happens all the time )

6- I have been living in Montreal for 8 years, and have never seen any solidarity between the local population here. People are nice yes, but they just don't seem authentic, they all secretly hate each other.

When we had the COVID19, people in the country side started rioting because they did not want Montreal residents who have a chalet in the country side, to go back to it. Because they did not want the Montrealers to infect them with Corona. Wow.... talk about brotherhood..  
Most docile population in the planet hands down.

7- Everything is expensive here. Wether it's cars, insurance, phone plans, food, tech equipment etc...  
Reason is, everything is imported. Canada has no industry.  
Also, Canada doesn't have a strong agricultural economy. Chicken costs twice what it does in the US, milk and other basic food are crazy expensive compared to US, Europe, Africa, Asia ( basically everywhere ).

8- Real estate is ridiculous, food and basically everything is expensive, you think your salary will be proportional ? Try again, salaries here are shit. Median individual income for a Canadian is 27,6k CAD ( which is a joke and around 20k USD).  
I make 72k a year personally, but it's impossible for me to have an apartment, or house, or have a family with this salary. I would need at least 100k.

9- Government are sucking the population's blood dry, they keep taxing us on literally everything as if it wasn't already expensive enough. And again the salaries are not following up, and nobody is complaining..

10- You can't go anywhere. There are 4 cities in this country and each one is 3 hours away from the other ( minimum )

11- Canada has a poor economy, our only strength I would say is the oil, gas and other minerals. If the price of these commodities crashes, Canada will be on its knees.

12- Government doesn't fund their army at all, because they consider it as something bad, therefore the situation with the army is sad to watch. They are under-equipped, and just stay in bases that look like a goulag from the Soviet era doing nothing."
