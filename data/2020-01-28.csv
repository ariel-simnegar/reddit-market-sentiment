Selling the 567.5 PUT 1/31 at 31.93

Buying the 565 PUT 1/31 at 29.30

Credit = 2.63 \* 100 = 263$ 

Collateral would be 250 since difference is 2.50 \* 100.

ABC trading @ 140-


Buy 1 $140 Call
Buy 1 $140 Put
Sell 10 $130 Put
Sell 10 $150 Call

From most charts I run this on it has a crazy good chance of profit, and much better profit potential than similar chains. 

The obvious risk is if either short falls ITM, where risk is exponential. But odds of that big of a jump in one week (~7% change) seems extremely slim, especially with the stocks im running it on. it seems like a ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù strategy, which should generate good profit over the long run. Even in a case where someone exercises an option OTM I could just exercise my ITM option to mitigate losses. 

Is there some greater risk I‚Äôm not seeing? I‚Äôve run this strategy on paper and it‚Äôs been extremely profitable. Someone help me see the hidden risk pleaseeee."

2020-01-29 03:23:21,chaney3,24,"Yes you're correct, it does seem like every time you enter a trade you instantly lose money, and it's because the odds aren't fair.  


If you enter a trade, you'd be forgiven in thinking the odds of the stock moving in your favor are 50/50 but you'd be wrong. When a retail trader enters a trade they either submit a market order, or a limit order generally. They either take the best offer price, or a pre-specified price. Institutional traders have a huge range of tool other than these two when making a trade.  


One of my favorite, and well known assistant trade algo orders is the CSFB sniper order. Other than sounding bad-ass af, it also works likes this: You specify a price target, say $50.13. The algo will automatically assist in your order and take any offer better than 50.13, but it will not post a bid for anything(so no one will know you are trying to get shares at the 50.13 price or better) It will only make a market order, once it spots an ask better than your specified price. In other words, I literally make whatever the spread is that you sell for between 50.13, and I can modify it so as orders come in at higher or lower prices the algo will automatically update the take price. Once I've accumulated enough shares I stop running the program and now every single one of my shares has been purchased at a better price than you could have gotten for it. Pretty simple, pretty effective. Good way to rile up the day traders who think they can spot trends in a 1min candle.  


So many options like this work at upper levels of trading where you will very much eat the cost of whatever your order is. If you submit your order it will be picked off and scalped by MMs and institutional accumulation algorithms, so make sure you are comfortable instantly seeing red 90% of the time. IDK, just bothers me that people don't know that they are working against an immensely bigger / more powerful system most of the time."

[As I was saying yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euueg4/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_28/ffrtwgr/), indicators were at oversold because we never had a reaction at the support level. I also said that normally it would have been a good place to buy the dip, but buying didn't come. I ascribed it to impending volatility and that waiting seemed wise. 

Today we did reverse up, and did so in a way that looked almost like a ""delayed"" reaction at the crayon support levels I had drawn, [gapping up almost precisely to the support and fighting up on the 5 minute chart.](https://imgur.com/7883OJk) 

With AAPL beating and futures mooning, I normally would be saying this is continued business as usual, even with some impending volatility ahead. But while we often joke about needing to feel the market around here, I really do have an uncomfortable feeling about this market behavior.  So for this Magical Crayons TA episode I will withhold any of my own ranges or predictions. For those that still want numbers, Bollinger Bands gives ranges at approximately 322.7-330.2. I think the earnings release of multiple big companies tomorrow AH and the FOMC meeting in the morning will provide better guidance from my own crayons. 

I hope you all grow lots of tendies tomorrow and let's see what Papa Powell does to the market."

2020-01-29 00:27:17,chaney3,8,"**TradWeb: The institutional Bond trading platform you didn‚Äôt know you needed.**  


For those that are less institutional MM and more WSBs, you‚Äôd be forgiven for never hearing about TradeWeb. In short TradeWeb is a sort of ‚ÄúBroker‚Äù for bonds, interest rate swaps, IRDs, debt securities both sovereign and corporate, collateralized equities, money markets, really a whole bunch of jazz.  


**Why you should be looking for an entry point in $TW:**  


Trade Web has a top notch platform, it‚Äôs well recognized as having excellent features and seamless access. Additionally, the support and integration to Institutional traders is very welcomed. Trading workflows, price discovery and order execution is top notch for clients of all shapes and sizes through $TW. But don‚Äôt just take my word for it, the proof is in it‚Äôs activity an uses:

With the usual suspects being a broad mix of Banks, Assent managers, pension funds, insurance and other capital intensive and rate sensitive industries, it‚Äôs no wonder why TradeWeb consistently racks up more than $700 Billion USD in notional value traded *per day* over the last year alone. And with deep pockets backing them Trade web will continue to develop and advance its platform.  
 

In a roundabout way, if you sort through the subsidiaries of who owns who in the mess that is international finance, you‚Äôll eventually come to realize that the majority stake of TradeWebs Class A Voting stock, and an even larger chunk of the class B shares are held by Blackstone Group. It makes it considerably easier to leg into this long position when you consider that one of the largest and most powerful asset mangers in the world is backing the expense sheets over at TradeWeb. With a vested stake, $BX will undoubtedly seek to continue innovative interest in servicing this company.  
 

**Risks and opportunities:**  


The risks in this trade are very similar to the same risks that plague banks and other large financial institutions, however given $TWs tailored specialty in the fixed income market, the upside reward is much greater. A large uptick in the amount of fixed income, safe haven assets being traded is coming. As times get more uncertain into the late cycle we‚Äôre currently experiencing, it‚Äôs safe to assume that revenues from these trades will also grow. Currently over 50% of revenues come from transaction fees alone, making this a hand in hand bullish trade on the assumption that bond demand will increase.  
 

While the company stock is still relatively young with it‚Äôs IPO being just recently in April, I am carefully considering adding this position to my portfolio and will ultimately decide to do so after this next ER on Wednesday, February 12th during pre-market. I have not gotten in depth on financials because if you also want to long shares of $TW you should be keen enough to look up a quote stub yourself and get a feel for the metrics."

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.
