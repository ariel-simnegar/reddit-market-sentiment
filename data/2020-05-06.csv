2020-05-07 01:37:58,,1,"**Answer to my own question: Nothing.**

Nothing happens because an out of the money call option grants the buyer the right to buy the underlying stock at a HIGHER price, which is something almost nobody will exercise on. On top of that, the out of the money call options may remain out of the money all the way to expiration and simply ""Expire out of the money"" like it never existed in the first place. So, why should the price of the underlying stock be affected by something that could jolly well never have existed at all, see? 

Now, stock price CAN be momentarily affected by an option when the option is exercised. 

If by expiration those out of the money call options becomes in the money and is exercised, the price of the stock would momentarily sink to the strike price of the call options and then almost instantly get back up to market price as market makers and market participants continue to bid and ask at market prices. In fact, this momentary sinking only happens when a HUGE amount of call options at the same strike price are exercised. This effect is hardly noticable if only small numbers of options contracts are exercised. This is also why trading volumes are so high on Quadruple Witching days when options and futures are exercised and settled for the underlying stocks. In fact, this effect is noticable only on Quadruple Witching days and are barely noticable during options only expiration."

2020-05-07 01:19:32,dawhizkid123,9,"PayPal earnings are not what they seem...

PayPal purchases and Venmo transfers aren‚Äôt broken out in the earnings report. All the new net accounts are bundled together. If you have one account each you count twice. 

CEO says May 1 was ‚Äúbiggest transaction day ever‚Äù - that should clue you in that it‚Äôs probably due to Venmo (rent due) and not PayPal.

If you look at Google trends Venmo interest definitely saw a huge bump with lockdowns. 

Why would Venmo become more popular in lockdown?
Probably a combination of greater need to send/receive money to/from family + roommates and/or online begging. 

Also...if you‚Äôre short cash and rent is due (May 1) then you can put rent on a credit card that you use to send rent money through Venmo for an extra fee. If I were an investor I would ask to see how much revenue growth was because of Venmo related credit card fees and whether the share of credit card transactions over the free debit ones have increased. My point is this is not necessarily sustainable for the user or PayPal. 

To;dr Pumping new net accounts and transactions is not necessarily reason to be bullish."

2020-05-07 00:27:39,CptTonyStark,6,"Working on my epic airlines DD, I think Buffett may have made a mistake cus he didn't run the numbers and Q2 won't be as bad as expected. 

Passenger planes without passengers can't possibly generate a profit, right? Wrong. Most of the world's cargo is carried in the belly hold of long haul flights and cancellations have resulted in cargo capacity being cut by 23% but demand for cargo capacity is cut by only 15% thanks to demand for medical supplies, which are overwhelmingly produced in Asia.

Combine this supply and demand mismatch with a 5x reduction in jet fuel prices and 0 marginal cost of labor (US airlines are required not to fire/furlough their workers as part of the bailout agreement), and you get airlines running long and short haul passengers planes with no passengers and still generating a fat profit, while getting bailout money as well.

In fact, this is such a significant shift that the Anchorage Airport in Alaska was the busiest airport in the world in April 2020 thanks to its strategic shipping location. As long as COVID-19 cases continues rising, this source of profit will keep airlines afloat.

Wait for Futures open on Sunday for the rest of the DD."

But I sold out of all my calls today and then right before the bell during that little selloff I bought back into QQQ $221 calls for 5/8. I am hoping the markets are up a little bit at open so I can cash them out and then figure out my next moves. 

Wanted to get back into TGT calls but held off. I will probably wait until Friday or Monday to re enter any of those positions."

2020-05-06 23:58:21,dprocks17,2,"TTD seems like the play against going into their earnings tomorrow.  The stock has had a huge run up in the last few weeks, way too much of one IMO, it doesn't have much more room up anyway.  It stayed propped up when facebook and google posted okay numbers but feel like the rug is about to be pulled out.  Most of their clients are brand/agency which clearly are cutting back.   Doubtful they give any guidance, not that it has really mattered though.  Problem is puts are pretty expensive if you want to give yourself any room either in terms of strike price and or expiration date.  Feel like there is a play here though."

I know I am stupid for doing this, but serious question: should I:
- sell all at open
- sell half at open and wait for the other half to recover. 
- keep it all. 

Nobody has a crystal bowl, but I would appreciate if someone who knows about airlines can tell me if and why Spirit Airlines is more F****d than other airlines and why it might or might not recover."

For one, nothing is a sure thing. Second, I work in a similar space or sell into the same teams who would buy their product and there is heavy resistance with purchasing right now. Even the big boys have stopped sales conversations with us and teams are fully focused on maximizing productivity with what they already have. The slow down for us happened almost 2 months ago. Went from largest quarter in company history to the worst quarter(by alot). Infrastructure spending has come to a halt and people are looking at ways to decrease spend in that area of their engineering org.

personally, I am loading up on puts. My 2 cents(also what my portfolio is going to be after this)."
