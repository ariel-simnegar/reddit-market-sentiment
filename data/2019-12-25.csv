13 cents.

The stock has 1.2 billion shares due to dilution and horrible mismanagement of capital. 2 executives left recently and there has been massive insider selling, some C-suites selling over 60-80% of their stock. This is all prior to a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù Coca Cola partnership. Literally follows no logical foundation. Cam Battley being the figure head of the entire company was basically shown the door.

Their last Q, ACB openly said they are persevering capital to focus on key projects = running out of money.

It‚Äôs an awful company.

Coca Cola can source CBD from literally any licensed producer in the world. It‚Äôs a legal product, why tie yourself to one company?

""You've probably noticed that if you drop even the bounciest of tennis balls from a height, it never quite bounces back higher than where it started. When you drop the ball, gravity pulls it down and it picks up speed. It hits the ground and squashes at impact. As the squashed ball springs back to its original shape, it pushes on the floor, and the floor pushes back. The force of the floor pushing against the ball throws the ball back into the air."""
