13 cents.

The stock has 1.2 billion shares due to dilution and horrible mismanagement of capital. 2 executives left recently and there has been massive insider selling, some C-suites selling over 60-80% of their stock. This is all prior to a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù Coca Cola partnership. Literally follows no logical foundation. Cam Battley being the figure head of the entire company was basically shown the door.

Their last Q, ACB openly said they are persevering capital to focus on key projects = running out of money.

It‚Äôs an awful company.

Coca Cola can source CBD from literally any licensed producer in the world. It‚Äôs a legal product, why tie yourself to one company?

""You've probably noticed that if you drop even the bounciest of tennis balls from a height, it never quite bounces back higher than where it started. When you drop the ball, gravity pulls it down and it picks up speed. It hits the ground and squashes at impact. As the squashed ball springs back to its original shape, it pushes on the floor, and the floor pushes back. The force of the floor pushing against the ball throws the ball back into the air."""

EDIT: prob a good idea to load up on **$CGC and $CRON calls** because if the MJ sector does indeed bounce back in 2020, institutions are more likely to buy these two who have billions of dollars from the $STZ and $MO equity investment. (AKA they are the safer plays for big money).

Especially if $CRON makes a US entry thru a strategic acquisition of a MSO. $CGC went ham when they bought the option to buy-out $ACRG when US legalizes."
