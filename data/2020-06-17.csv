#its your boy chimpu back with another update and insights


Asia has recovered yesterdays losses and some are  Currently extending gains

India up over 2%

Europe futures are holding on to their yesterdays tally


As said yesterday each time NASDAQ gets closer to 10k market will take a breather, as 9500 - 10000 is consolidation zone for NASDAQ which will likely break upwards sooner or later


Spy zones which we will be dealing today is same as yesterday, a change from explansionary market to contractionary market has been observed in the past week


Major resistance at 315 ( institutions are determined to observe this zone as profit booking zone)


Major support at 307 ( this is one of the bullish resistance formed after last weeks price action )


Today's plan will again be same as yesterdays, by going long each time we 310 or below spy gives an entry opportunity 


#307 - 315 tends to form a wider support resistance relationship, my bias is that today also we might trade between 309 and 314


The notion of many trades with small profits continue and recommendation of not holding derivative position over night stays


For long term investors : the market is still Making higher highs and lower lows and vix is still observed to be on down trend in long term charts, this making a good entry point, person recomdation is still the same, invest in SIP mode to take opportunity of the volitality


Random quote of the day : ""revenge trading is profitable, profitable for the house""

>Admitting he was blindsided by the hysterical reaction to a pretty normal transaction, North Carolina Senator Richard Burr wondered Friday when profiting off mass suffering had suddenly become a crime in this country. ‚ÄúJesus Christ, when did everyone get so uptight about this? I remember when we used to celebrate people who used their talent and connections to get rich from death and anguish,‚Äù said Burr, who claimed what he did was no different than what many successful, patriotic Americans have been doing for hundreds of years. ‚ÄúEven Tucker Carlson is being a little bitch about this. What‚Äôs the big deal? Didn‚Äôt we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly \[Loeffler\] and Ron \[Johnson\] about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What‚Äôs the point of being a senator if you can‚Äôt profit off the world‚Äôs problems? I‚Äôm making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil. There‚Äôs something seriously wrong with this country.‚Äù At press time, Burr announced his intentions to resign after shamefully admitting he only pulled in a 22% return from his insider trading."

2020-06-18 08:22:11,SixOneFive615,-1,"This DD isn't based on data, it's based on logic:

Poor motherfuckers (read: Robinhood ""retail investors"") used their $1,200 and hoped to flip it. Problem is, they invested in airlines, cruise lines, and other value stocks with the hope of a big pop. But the institutional investors are aware of this.

The most popular ""retail"" travel stocks got hammered earlier in the week, and have been relatively flat since (SAVE, DAL, NCLH, CCL, etc.). I believe this is very specifically because the institutional investors have artificially held the price down. Now, the retail investors' options will expire tomorrow, likely useless, and rent is due in a week. Since it takes a few days to transfer from Robinhood to your bank, I expect Friday/Monday to see a huge sell off from retail investors, as they lick their wounds and take their losses because rent has to be paid.

And what do you think will happen in the second half of next week? Institutional investors will swoop in to grab stocks that are already a genuine value for an even cheaper price, driving the costs up to where the retail investors were hoping it would go in the first place.

Moral of the story: It's not just ""don't invest money you can't lose"" (which is true), it's also ""don't invest money that you can't leave invested in the long term"". 

TLDR: Retail investors have rent due, plus there's a lead time to pull money, so I expect a selloff on already undervalued stocks Friday/Monday. Buy low."

As early as ancient Babylon and India, Central Banking, the art of monopolizing the issuance of money, had been developed into a perfect method for looting the general public. Even today many bankers copy the traditions of the earlier exploitive priesthoods and design their banks to resemble temples! Defenses of Central Banking are simply part of the deception that lies at the heart of all power elites.

Asia has recovered yesterdays losses and some are  Currently extending gains

India up over a %

Europe futures are holding on to their yesterdays tally


As said yesterday each time NASDAQ gets closer to 10k market will take a breather, as 9500 - 10000 is consolidation zone for NASDAQ which will likely break upwards sooner or later


Spy zones which we will be dealing today is same as yesterday, a change from explansionary market to contractionary market has been observed in the past week


Major resistance at 315 ( institutions are determined to observe this zone as profit booking zone)


Major support at 307 ( this is one of the bullish resistance formed after last weeks price action )


Today's plan will again be same as yesterdays, by going long each time we 310 or below spy gives an entry opportunity 


#307 - 315 tends to form a wider support resistance relationship, my bias is that today also we might trade between 309 and 314


The notion of many trades with small profits continue and recommendation of not holding derivative position over night stays


For long term investors : the market is still Making higher highs and lower lows and vix is still observed to be on down trend in long term charts, this making a good entry point, person recomdation is still the same, invest in SIP mode to take opportunity of the volitality

Luckily I know the consequences of using leverage to make money. I might very well blow up and get a margin call and have to sell my equity to cover losses. Most people will get blown up though. Just do your dd. I know people will get mad at me on this sub for saying this, but the stock market is not a casino. It sucks there's no table games rn at the actual casinos, but wait patiently and you will have your chance to put it all on black.

2020-06-18 06:34:36,Nuzlbuny,8,"Some quick Dix analysis for those who are interested. With Dix being at 50 today, I was curious how high Dix has impacted short term results in the past.

Since March 2020, 13 days have had Dix 49 or above. Of those 13 Days, 11 closed green the next day (85%). 

Here is the real interesting part though. Of those 13 days, only 6 opened green (46%).

That means that it reversed from red to green 5 out of 7 times (71%). Overall it closes higher than it opens 70% of the the time. 

The median gain was 0.88% and avg gain was 1.08% of all 13 days.

Also of note, the 2 days that closed red were followed with 2.28% and 3.06% gains the following day. 

I know this is a limited data set but it's something I noticed qualitatively that it seemed to reverse a lot on high Dix red days and so started playing this by selling my puts and entering short term calls at open. Most recently was Monday when we opened down 2% and closed up 1 with a Dix of 49.7 the prior day."

The downward pressure in the evening was so fucking intense, and the big support floor we had to break was 3066.

3066 got smashed by what was the biggest red dildo I've ever fucking seen at 10:45, then it just instantly bounced back. I knew at that point bears were likely fuuuuucked.

But even with all the crazy bullish reversals, this one was the craziest I've ever seen. We went from like the most intense downward pressure ever to just straight up euphoria buying in an instant. And there wasn't even any logic to it.

And even now, as we go green, VIX is still +1.6%

One day, economists will look back in disgust at the horror show that we currently call responsible central bank policy. The idea that a central bank should be in the business of ""quantitative easing"" during downturns will be laughably absurd. The purchase of corporate bonds, stocks, or MBS will rightly be judged a white collar crime. Coordination or communication of any kind with large hedge funds such as BlackRock will be the height of corruption and grounds for immediate removal; those who worked in the public sector will not be allowed to join the private sector after retirement, and vice versa. The idea of 0% rates under any circumstances will be viewed as a recipe for disaster.

There will come a time when you will look ONLY to a company's balance sheets and financial reports to decide if its stock is going up or down, because the public will have such a wealth of financial knowledge at its fingertips that price discovery will be stronger than ever. There will come a time when earnings reports are composed according to rock solid GAAP, and they are released not quarterly, but daily, compiled by artificial intelligences. Complete transparency down to how many meals the CEO marked as a business expense, and at what restaurants.

There will come a day when your employer will pay you for your labor entirely in shares, and if they do anything immoral you'll just quit rather than have your reputation soiled like that. You can just live off your UBI anyway.

On that day, I will stop buying puts. üêª"

2020-06-18 05:43:36,i__like_turtles_,14,"I really hate printers, man.

I have legit had mental breakdowns and panic attacks because of printers. In high school, I would do everything in my power to avoid printing at home, but there'd be some days where it would just be unavoidable and I'd have to use our printer at home. 

Now, I don't know what the deal is with printers or why they fucking hate me so much, maybe I insulted the printer's mother at some point, but I have broken brand new printers just by touching them. That's it. Just by touching them at it happens every. single. damn. time I try to use the printer at home. My mom can plug in a printer and it works just fine, my sister, my dad uses it and nothing happens. But these things smell fear, I'm telling you. The moment I approach the printer everything decides to fail at once. I honestly have no idea what it is, it's like a curse and then we have no choice but to get a new printer every time I use the one at home. 

I cannot tell you how many printers we have gone through, but I remember one night I just snapped. I had to do a project on short notice (teacher's fault, otherwise I definitely would've done everything to avoid using the home printer). It was like around midnight and I had to have it printed for tomorrow first period. Guess what? The printer breaks and so do I. The next 30min - an hour was my mom having woke up and trying to calm me down because I have no fucking idea what happened but I was screaming and crying and shit like printers are fucking evil man like I really don't understand why every time I even touch our printer it magically breaks. Literally anywhere other than home, like at school or a library I can use the printer and not have to worry. 

But at home or at a friend's house I will be in raving fear lest I accidentally brush up against a printer because God knows I may have activated a fucking Decepticon with my all-spark genes or some shit and it'll come to life at night and murder my family, and my grade. I really hate printers, man."

Flipped $35 into $5200 from wednesday to friday in four plays on spy puts in a row that dodged the spy gains by locking profits on selling 1 strike under cus im PDT. 

I only got into this because I follow OSINT communities regularly and wanted a way to make money from home, OSINT aint do shit for my plays last week, but the sentiment was waying strong.

Shit is fucking bad everywhere, I don't think the market will drop as bad a March because we proved we can operate remotely the first wave, but shit...

It's a long strangle on a volatile and high volume ticker. Let's say you buy a $1000 out of the money call for one month out and a $1000 out of the money put for the same expiration. Once either leg gets to 30% profit, sell it, take $300 of profit and buy another $1000 option of the same type you just sold (call or put) either farther out of the money or later expiration. Keep repeating this everytime either reaches $1300.  Do nothing with the other leg until it starts to increase in value, and if it never does that means the other leg is taking off. As volatile as the market is right now, it doesn't seem very likely that neither leg increases in value."

A bestacled, bowler hatted gentleman in the crowd suggests, ""I say, the tie goes to the runner!""

Clinton - 46.8%

Trump - 43.6%

Biden‚Äôs victory hasn‚Äôt been priced in and it‚Äôs more likely than even Clinton‚Äôs. His victory would be bearish because he wants to raise corporate income taxes, which will undo the boost to corporate earnings received under the Trump administration.

Last night after hours I put in a limit order for 10 spy calls at 312 strike price and entered way below market price. 

Hopes were there market was going to bleed down a bit during jpow, and I‚Äôd pick them up real cheap without having to watch it as I‚Äôm too busy at work.

With an expiration on 6/19 hoping we‚Äôd get a bounce tomorrow and I could make a quick buck either tomorrow or Friday, also having picked them up cheap would be easier 

Just checked, my order when through, 10 calls 312 strike price at 0.9. 

Then they automatically sold at the end of the day for 0.22 cuz I bought 6/17 calls not 6/19 calls, and it closed at 311 and change.

 The analysis shows macro risks -- including credit spreads and the dollar -- are now accounting for the largest portion of the S&P 500‚Äôs returns in at least 14 years. That means securities are largely trading on broader economic factors rather than on the basis of earnings or corporate news.

Explaining why is relatively easy. Correlations are typically high at turning points in the business cycle as extreme positioning and changes in liquidity drive indiscriminate selling followed by dip-buying across the board, according to John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at JPMorgan.

The harder part is guessing what hedges will prove reliable for the likes of active real-money investors going forward."

This means that individual workers are more directly exposed to market risk while companies have been able to shed some liabilities.  If Powell and Co. were to let the market dump for a prolonged period of time, they would create a situation in which a significant chunk of workers would not (or could not) retire.  This would screw up the labor market even more.

2020-06-18 02:01:55,GatorMD12,7,"### What is Put Backspread?

### The Put Backspread is reverse of Put Ratio Spread. It is a bearish strategy that involves selling options at higher strikes and buying higher number of options at lower strikes of the same underlying asset. It is unlimited profit and limited risk strategy.

### When to initiate the Put Backspread

The Put Backspread is used when an option trader believes that the underlying asset will fall significantly in the near term.

### How to construct the Put Backspread?

* Sell 1 ITM/ATM Put
* Buy 2 OTM Put

The Put Backspread is implemented by selling one In-the-Money (ITM) or At-the-Money (ATM) put option and buying two Out-the-Money (OTM) put options simultaneously of the same underlying asset with the same expiry. Strike price can be customized as per the convenience of the trader.

But, I do occasionally play options, cautiously, in my IRA. Like this morning, I bought ENPH puts in my IRA.

There is literally nothing more satisfying in the options game than making a big play in your IRA. 100% tax free, and you feel like you cheated the system by basically forcing several years of contributions in your tax-advantaged account. And you feel like you actually did something useful (retirement) vs. just making fat stacks to blow on a car or computer or some shit.

\- Sell OTM Put  
\- Sell OTM Vertical Call Spread  
**Ideal Implied Volatility Environment :** High  
**Max Profit:** Credit received from opening trade. Max profit is realized when the stock price is between the short strikes at expiration.  
**How to Calculate Breakeven(s):**

2020-06-18 01:31:47,cutiesarustimes2,5,"So I was reading an article on PCG and inside was a link to an article about enron. For a minute I thought it was talking about 2020.

Here's some excerpts

In the hothouse atmosphere of the late ‚Äò90s, all of these ideas seemed reasonable, even commonplace. The stock market was soaring. People confused getting rich with being smart. The dot-coms, then riding high, looked like they would kill off the stodgy old industrial companies. It seemed like the boom times would never end.

Still, traces of the infatuation ingrained for so long in the loyal work force remain. One young man, who said he lost more than $50,000 in his savings plan and a small fortune in stock options and bonus money, was still optimistic that the company would survive.

‚ÄúI believe in the integrity of the management,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis job could be fun again.‚Äù


Feels alot like 2020

Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.

Both short-sellers and contrarians are making risky moves. A wise investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock."

2020-06-18 00:52:55,ThePeoplesBard,14,"**An excerpt from my upcoming novel for gay Bears, *50 Shades of Red*:**

Jerome waltzes in with a crazed look in his eyes. His silver hair is disheveled; he has bed head from being awoken at such an early hour.

Wordlessly, he holds out his hands in a *What gives?* gesture. I notice the ink beneath his finger nails. Then I notice the countless thin nicks and scratches on his hands: paper cuts.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of ink, sir,‚Äù one of my coworkers says carefully. Suddenly, I can feel the exhaustion in Jerome‚Äôs body, and I almost feel sorry for him. Without responding, he sleepily glides to an office at the back of the Mint floor. I hold up my hand, about to speak, but a colleague‚Äôs hand touches my shoulder. I turn to see her holding a finger to her lips. So I just follow at a distance, then angle myself to see through the window of the office Jerome entered.

He rolls up his sleeves, then approaches a giant, blue plastic drum. Various squirt bottles appear in his hands, and he moves methodically, dispensing their contents with flourishes, almost like a maestro leading a symphony. I realize he is hand making the proprietary secret green cocktail that paints our currency. In awe, I watch his body move. When it comes time to mix the brew, he inserts a long wooden rod into the barrel, raising and dropping it like he‚Äôs churning butter.

Watching the silver fox, I feel a tingle at my waist‚Äîand a tear fall down my cheek.

An arbitrageur is a type of investor who attempts to profit from market inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can relate to any aspect of the markets, whether it is price or dividends or regulation. The most common form of arbitrage is price.

Arbitrageurs exploit price inefficiencies by making simultaneous [trades](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp) that offset each other to capture risk-free profits. An arbitrageur would, for example, seek out price discrepancies between stocks listed on more than one exchange by buying the [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) shares on one exchange while [short selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) the same number of [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp) shares on another exchange, thus capturing risk-free profits as the prices on the two exchanges converge."

C. Airlines took modest hits from SARS and other hyped contagions with the international carriers being hit the hardest(still relatively modest hit, in comparison).

Take A + B + C^3 happening all at once and I think the guy with $70 billion might be onto something.

On Thursday, we gapped down overnight and blew through multiple support levels.. 

A support / resistance is basically an accumulation of demand at a certain price level

Because we dropped soo quickly.. we were unable to clear all of the excess buy side demand

Hence the technical bounce back above 3100.. now that we‚Äôve cleared excess demand between 3000 - 3100.. we could see a significant drop 

TLDR - Retest 2950 in the near term.. will likely fail on first attempt and we‚Äôll bounce back to 3000

Medium term target 2800 retest"

Fuck.

First off, this is terrible because the stoner can‚Äôt buy as much weed anymore. But even worse, far worse, his rent is due next week. The stoner is in full panic mode.

‚ÄùFUCK, I need to sell stuff, I need to sell my TV,  I need to sell my Xbox, I need to sell my phone...wait...my phone‚Äù

The stoner panics and begins to liquidate assets, he needs cash ASAP and that‚Äôs all that matters. But the stoner has parents (The Fed).

The stoner calls its parents, and explains that it fucked up bad. It knows it‚Äôs fucked up before but it‚Äôs been so long and it‚Äôs been so good since then, please help again.

The Stoner‚Äôs parents, when it comes down to the bottom line, really just want to support the stoner in the hopes that one day it‚Äôll get its shit together, so they tell the stoner they can borrow money for rent as long as they need to.

Now we have this situation: The stoner has less money for weed, but now doesn‚Äôt have to worry about rent. Far less panic than when he was worried about rent. Exponentially less."

I like the GEX as a better indicator. You can see it is pretty spot on for dictating a trend change. When the GEX gets high, it becomes harder for the current trend to maintain itself and often signals a trend reversal. Take a look at the GEX a few days before most major dips. You can see it gets really high and we proceed to dump a few days after."
