#its your boy chimpu back with another update and insights


Asia has recovered yesterdays losses and some are  Currently extending gains

India up over 2%

Europe futures are holding on to their yesterdays tally


As said yesterday each time NASDAQ gets closer to 10k market will take a breather, as 9500 - 10000 is consolidation zone for NASDAQ which will likely break upwards sooner or later


Spy zones which we will be dealing today is same as yesterday, a change from explansionary market to contractionary market has been observed in the past week


Major resistance at 315 ( institutions are determined to observe this zone as profit booking zone)


Major support at 307 ( this is one of the bullish resistance formed after last weeks price action )


Today's plan will again be same as yesterdays, by going long each time we 310 or below spy gives an entry opportunity 


#307 - 315 tends to form a wider support resistance relationship, my bias is that today also we might trade between 309 and 314


The notion of many trades with small profits continue and recommendation of not holding derivative position over night stays


For long term investors : the market is still Making higher highs and lower lows and vix is still observed to be on down trend in long term charts, this making a good entry point, person recomdation is still the same, invest in SIP mode to take opportunity of the volitality


Random quote of the day : ""revenge trading is profitable, profitable for the house""
