Thank you, thank you, I'm back, I know, it's been awhile.

I'm here on occasion to tell you about the future of Volatility.


I want you to know that Volatility will be going slightly lower. You should not buy yet but you can start to slowly build your position for a small selloff coming next year. 

We are not going to have the big crash or whatever they will try to scare you into, but we will have the ""pullback"" down closer to SPY 300-310 at some point.

So, here is what you will need to do:


Notice Vix is at 12.80. We used to be as low as 10-ish. Therefore we will go back down to 10-ish again probably when they announce more good trade war news.


That is the time you will start to really load up on calls on Vix.  You will have to be patient and wait for us to get closer to 10.

Now notice how options are only dated out till June 2020? So that means they will price in the pullback of the market.

Which means we will only see some smaller pullbacks and I want you to notice there is only open Interest at strike 50 at highest for the longest dates expiration.


I want you to go through the options chain and you'll probably notice like I did that 15 on the Vix seems very very important for some reason. 

Therefore I determine we will only rise to around 15-25 on the vix between now and the middle of 2020.


Make your volatility trade accordingly.

The grape is back."

2019-12-23 21:08:02,knotswag,10,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Low volume day today so it's difficult to really determine market directionality. I would say that today's market behavior is showing some slightly bearish signs that could be corrected if we go up a bit tomorrow. I say this because we [breached the bullish trendline](https://imgur.com/LkR0nnK) on the hourly and we're [testing the bullish trendline on the daily](https://imgur.com/FRjhTGh) charts. Last Friday I noted [we breached the bullish trendline as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edfzlw/weekend_discussion_thread_december_2022_2019/fbiaa4j/); this is the second time it's happened in consecutive days. But again, because it's holiday week this sort of trading behavior may not mean much at all because most of the non-degenerates are not staring at charts for the next few days.

Ideal bullish behavior tomorrow is to see a close at/above 322; flat trading would be okayish too. If we rise tomorrow early and get knocked down from the 322 it'd be mildly concerning and I'd suspect we see 320.x again intraday.

That's all folks, see you tomorrow for the abbreviated trading day. Hope Santa is packing tendies into his sleigh for all of us as we speak. We've been good autists."
