If these  treasuries  keep going down or stay low, that tells you increased demand and low yields.

This only happens in an equity sell off . If price action is positive, a relief rally is present in the stock market.

Watch the US 10 Year treasury, it is a measurement of true investor sentiment, not volatile price action influenced by central banks and money injections.

Think smart and be safe. Short positions could be on sale during this relief rally. Don't chase the magic dragon too much.
