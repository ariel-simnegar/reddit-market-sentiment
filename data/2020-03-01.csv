If these  treasuries  keep going down or stay low, that tells you increased demand and low yields.

This only happens in an equity sell off . If price action is positive, a relief rally is present in the stock market.

Watch the US 10 Year treasury, it is a measurement of true investor sentiment, not volatile price action influenced by central banks and money injections.

Think smart and be safe. Short positions could be on sale during this relief rally. Don't chase the magic dragon too much.

The consensus seems to be that the CDC made some bad decisions early on, including developing their own ineffectual [Coronavirus test](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/01/health-officials-probe-coronavirus-cdc-118523). I am sure that we will see a considerable uptick in cases within the next two weeks across North America. If the Fed lowers interest rates this week, it will be a critical error to do so simply to quell a bearish market.

I think that while investors cry at the Fed and markets rise in the early hours of the 2nd, buy month-long puts in manufacturing and tourism sectors. This bull market is not going down without a fight.

2020-03-02 05:22:04,DGUWYWMFWYWN,6,"People who think that Coronavirus is going to cause a recession aren't looking at the big picture. The inherent value of equities isn't in the short term. A bad month doesn't significantly change the long term economic health of a company. Sure some companies that are near bankruptcy might have financial issues, but those companies already have their poor financial health factored into their stock price. Healthy companies aren't going anywhere, and they may even be looking to move some production to the US as a failsafe. In the scale of 5+ years, Coronavirus may even benefit the United States at China's detriment, and the US economy may be better off than if Coronavirus never happened. 

Think about it. In 10 years, is Microsoft going to be significantly different from its current trajectory because of a bad quarter in 2020? Once fear subsides, the economy will be fine, regardless of Coronavirus and its spread. 

In other words, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the economy. This drop is centered in fear. Once the media gets tired of propagating the fear, people get desensitized, and people go back to work, we'll go back to highs. The media is already pushing the narrative that Coronavirus is like the flu and rationality is returning. I'm not saying that this is the absolute bottom, but I am saying that this is an extremely rare buying opportunity, and you're an idiot if you're not averaging down."

No issues in supply chain currently but weren't prepared for this level of traffic. Upping orders to support bigger demand. Not sure if we will see a drop in purchases of non essentials coming up and I'm not sure how chinese store will do. Will keep close eye on trends with meat sold and deli items sold. I figure less steak and party items/social foods or food handled my workers and more canned goods being purchased will be a large loss for costco considering they are already losing money in the meat department. The deli recoups losses from meat by cooking chickens and other meats and selling them. So far everything's going quick. So not sure if I should short Costco for earnings or go long.

Most importantly, the put/call ratio trends when looking at 2008 to now. We're at .85, 2008 peaked at 1.35ish. We can expect a decrease to under .6 before we rocket up to 1.35 territory again, ASSUMING this will be as bad as 08.

2020-03-01 23:16:42,Screw7788,4,"Why SPCE IS A MEME STOCK AND A SHIT COMPANY not worth over 4$/share. (Btw I got puts on this mofo)

1- The name virgin is just a slap marketing gimmick after Branson‚Äôs success. It‚Äôs like if chipotle started making smartphones, and people thinking they would be great, because they are successful in selling burritos

2- the last time they tested, the Co-Pilot died and it was 10 years ago. There is 50% or greater cha Che it will happen again in Their next flight or the next 20 flights. Any single time if it happens, it would put a pause to the company for 10 more years. Imagine hearing in the news that a rich fuck has died on one of these joy rides. That‚Äôs the end of the company. Many of amazon and spaceX‚Äôs rockets have exploded in the past several years

3 - it is not actually going to space, but flying really high; which makes them in no shape or form comparable to Musk‚Äôs or Bezos space programs; where they have opportunity with gov & corporate contracting.

4- the cost for a 3min quickie flight is absord and people will lose interest after the first 5-6 flights (if that ever happens) without killing the next set of travelers.

5- the stock is getting pumped, but soon (next week) will lose all its value once the 27 million set of warranted shares hits the market at 11$/share and fucking the value in the ass

Now - let‚Äôs assume that the company is successful in their next flight; they still need fucking billions and billions in marketing; R&D and  actual fucking interest from people who would want to fly

The 8000 people who have signed up is BS; and really are just WSb trolls pumping the stock value. But when it comes to actual people wanting to put in 300k; good fucking luck! 


So fuck SPCE;

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever buy FDs. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a FD. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me autism anyway."
