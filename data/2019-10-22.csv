Volume was about 2 - 2.5x the average today, which is huge for that ticker... With other sectors selling off, seems like a lot of money flowed in and hopefully will continue to flow in. It also recently touched ATHs over the past week or two, above early 2018 levels. ER is coming up in a few weeks, IV is relatively low.

9/20 50c expired ITM by a buck or two. 10/18 53c also expired in the money. There were 2k 11/15 55c contracts traded yesterday which is pretty significant, so I scooped a bunch up yesterday and today at the lows.
