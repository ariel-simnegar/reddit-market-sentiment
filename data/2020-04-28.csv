2020-04-29 09:07:56,NumberSpace,12,"A quick post for those confused by earnings. I've seen a lot of posts about ""hey, my company beat or met expectations yet they went down on earnings"" or ""how did a company that missed earnings skyrocket?"" Well the answer my fellow degenerates is how MM's calculate intrinsic value of a company. Those earnings estimates come from an analysts 10 year forecast of a company and they make certain assumptions about future performance. Those future predictions matter more for the company's valuations than near term results, especially for certain high flying tech companies where 90% of their value is based on their terminal value (aka far future predicted value). The real reason is the forecast provided by CEOs is the most valuable part of earnings. Current quarter earnings just validate the analyst's model, but future forecasts completely upend them

TLDR: CEO future forecasts matter more than EPS, especially for certain high value tech companies"

so far i've been been playing wheel with success with the airlines (i think they've basically been thru the wringer and alll bad news has been expected) and oil (bottoming out and stabilizing here).  was thinking about casino/hotels b/c felt they were in a similar position.  banks for now?  but still yet to be seen if there are crazy defaults and shit in coming up.  i guess w/ fed backstopping it it's less of an issue.

- the forms to upload are different for each type of business, so be aware of what’s required and read the instructions thoroughly—don’t fuck it up

- using a payroll company (Gusto for me) made it faster and easier to locate the correct documents, already digitized for immediate upload

- squeaky wheels gets the grease: emailing my PPP contact with BofA pleading prioritization (give your reasons) expedited their submission to the SBA the next day"

Nearly 2.5 months and all those trades for being basically down $10k. To be clear I started with like $5k and worked up, the most value I had in my account at one time was about $85k (didn’t sell) from $36k of puts. So there were some definite moments of major wins, but on the whole been a disappointing run. We shall see what earnings does.

Some observations:
-initial timing was great, but my buys were unfocused, though there were some good picks in there.
-luck has a lot to do with it.
-If you’re yolo, take profit early, and sell losses earlier, esp if near DTE.
-while generally ok at selling losses, several held losing positions too long and sold positions that would have won too early when I had weeks left. Of course diamond handing puts kind of overshadows all of that.
-StOnKs only go down, except for when they’re going up.
-Blowing up an account, no matter the size, fucking sucks."

2020-04-29 03:21:35,DestroyerOfPussy69,8,"If anybody actually thinks that everything is going to start opening back up and the pandemic is over you are absolutely delusional.

The only way the virus goes away is: we develop a vaccine, 60% or more of the population gets infected and we get herd immunity, or there is a breakthrough treatment developed that can be easily mass produced.

A vaccine won’t be developed until Q1 or Q2 2021, and those are optimistic estimates. When you hear about companies entering trials or making breakthroughs in vaccines, that doesn’t mean anything substantial. And no, companies cannot just rush a vaccine out because the situation is dire and requires it, an untested vaccine can make a disease worse and also be a waste of valuable production resources.

Herd immunity could always happen but I don’t want to know what things look like when 60-80% of the population has been infected, not a real option.

A miracle treatment could always happen but it would be just that, a miracle. There is no guarantee that diseases can be easily treated or cured. We still deal with the flu and common cold every year.

People don’t understand that this is a force of nature, the virus doesn’t give a fuck what Trump says or if the economy can open again or not, it just exists, and it will continue to spread and infect more people. It’s not just going to disappear.

Infectivity has been revealed to be greater than earlier estimates thus far, but good news is that the virus’s survivability on surfaces and in the air is greatly reduced by UV rays and also slightly reduced by heat and humidity. This means summer may slow it down a bit. However, it definitely isn’t going anywhere, and the more things get opened up the sooner a second wave will arrive.

How this applies to the stock market? You decide. But if you think Q1 and Q2 are the only quarters that are going to be effected you are sorely mistaken, not only that but we are at the end of both the long and short term debt cycles, a decline seems imminent. Maybe the fed printer will truly prevail over all, but the point of quantitative easing is simply to counter deflation with inflation, so it makes perfect sense given the deflationary period we are now in. Its purpose is simply to reduce the pain and give equities and assets a soft landing instead of a hard crash."

*1. This shit stays green for around a month more but once we hit June, shit gets nasty. The next round of rent will be due, stim checks will be gone, businesses that are opening are only serving ~40% at the most capacity, people went back to work and not collecting unemployment but also receiving much less in pay.

*2. This shit hits the fan very very soon. If the market is forward looking then it wont wait until June to take a hit, it'll wait until all forms of cushioning are gone then shabam.

How do we keep at these levels that are similar to 2019 without things being open, people going out, or having the same amount of income?

What the fuck happened?"
2020-04-29 01:43:00,LeveragedShit,5,"Do the math. NAT charges $76,000 per day for 6 months to store oil on their ships. They work with all the big players. They have 26 vessels in the fleet. NAT market cap is 1.08B. 

Completely leaving out debts and all the other important, but for this post irrelevant data, if all 26 vessels are capable of holding crude, all charging $76,000 per day.. you’re looking at roughly 2.3M per vessel per month, and $27.7M per year. 

That times 26 and we’re talking about $721M collected to hold onto oil - that to this very second is still gushing out of this earth with no end in sight. 

The reality is, that these numbers are probably not accurate as some tankers aren’t suitable. And we’re forgetting all other factors, expenses, debts, and the works.... but even if the numbers are 1/4 correct that’s close to 1/4 of their current market cap. 

This ain’t investment advice.. but i am personally holding. Demand in oil won’t be coming back like it did pre-corona next month or the following after. Perhaps it can even get back to the 50s like in 2006 🤯

•	⁠25,000 PCR tests a day (the standard test)
•	⁠Antibody (serology) - started with their own employees, currently have done 1,000 tests. Highly accurate test (95-100% accurate, wow!), nothing like what you are hearing in the press. Less quality tests will tests for all coronaviruses, Bioreference test will be more specific.
•	⁠Infrastructure is in place for drawing blood for these tests and the analyzers are much faster.
•	⁠100,000 - 200,000 A DAY by second week of May
•	⁠30,000 in a week then a significant scale up , WILL BE NATIONALLY DONE
•	⁠IT systems need to be brought up to handle the new users coming online to check their results

2020-04-29 00:08:52,mr_blockchain_,2," Imagine this:

All the bag holders who gambled on earnings calls will need to close out of their positions. Selling a ton of calls tomorrow at 6:30, so they could find a more lucrative gamble (instead of being stuck in the one they have already lost last night - uh-uh, not for the kind of degenerate that is an option trader!).

The hunch is it will go down more when we open. People keep trying to time 'the crash'. Everyone even stopped talking about it, because they think that THEY will be the one to call the top.

AMD 5/1 tomorrow at 6:30, sell by mid or end of day. You can also hold them thru Thursday, if you're out of day trades. Don't go yolo, but ATM!!"

Aswell, oil prices have been rocking them. My plan is to buy and sell once the WTI crude price goes negative, since there's a saudi flotilla of oil on our way and storage is still full. I don't think the opening of the economy will help enough by 19th of May (when the WTI contract expires). I think its going to be worse than last time because production hasn't stopped but storage is still full. If anything they should feel a harsher force this time since the oil will not trickle down the supply chain. They are also the most leveraged independent E&P. Big oil and regulators (texas oil regulator i can give you article links) are basically saying to NOT intervene and to let the free market decide their fate. In my eyes, this is big oil saying fuck em and letting all the small guys die so they can pick up the scraps. Honestly invest in Chevron and other big oil companies they are gonna have a monopoly on shale.

These are just my scattered thoughts on it. lmk what y'all think. The main thing against this play is the SPY. Earnings are on the 6th. DYOR.

If the market is happy about good Q1 earnings and ominous words but no concrete Q2 guidance, that's what they'll get again. Microsoft might not even dip in Q2 based on Google's comments on their cloud division.

Apple is mostly tracking with other FANG stocks (up 24% from the March bottom, just like FB and GOOG).  There's no good reason for this.  China is a big portion of Apple's revenue, and spent most of the quarter locked in their houses, not two weeks like the west, and missed out on their second-biggest shopping season. Their factories lost two months of work, during a period when they should be retooling and getting ready to ramp up summer production of the big new fall products; I would expect the new iPhones to be delayed this year as a result."

I think the Fed is aware that pumping the S&P to 4000 while the unemployment rate soars to Great Depression levels could be politically untenable. The Fed only cares about preventing a deflationary crash and massive liquidity injections were necessary for that in March. It’s unlikely they go back to such aggressive actions unless equities start heading back down hard again."
