Robinhood declined to give further details to Bloomberg, but said that they are “aware of the isolated situations and communicating directly with customers.”"

2. Deutsche Bank somehow manages to lose hundreds of billions of euros in a very short period of time on leveraged speculative investments, perhaps intentionally imploding itself so it can file for bankruptcy.
3. The money has been laundered and all those powerful people no longer have to pay back the loans since the bank is insolvent. All according to a plan laid out years ago.
4. You have just witnessed the Robinhood infinite money cheat successfully used except on a global scale. The recession this triggers will allow the mega rich to buy up lots of properties extremely cheaply, further cementing their oligarchy."

2 Calls on $FUN at Strike price $60 Expiring 11/15

Cedar Fair has an earnings report tomorrow morning and I'm expecting (with reason) big things.

Also I'm holding an FD on AMD for no reason (Strike Price 37.5 expiring 11/8) and much more reasonable Long call for 1/20/2020 at Strike Price $40. Ryzen beat the pants off of Intel's products this year and their pricing on the new AMD Video cards beats Nvidia's products in terms of bang for buck, so I'm expecting a great Black friday for them. Especially since RTX literally just has modern warfare. 

I believe in my Cedar Fair call, its the AMD one that's rustling my jimmies. Thoughts? Am I a retard who thinks they're smart? or are these good ideas."

The Reddit community, Wall Street Best, treats trading like a game, and the scoreboard goes both ways. Reddit user, ControlTheNarrative, used the bug discussed above to buy Apple put options just before their earnings. ...Yeah, we know. His trade saw his account go $60,000 in the negative after Apple beat on their earnings report and consequently reached new all-time highs.

- Sell 12/2020 $25C for $280 


- Receive $28,000 that RH dogshit margin algo treats as principal and multiplies by 2x.


- Repeat to infinity until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance.

On the other hand, I mean, sure, this is the retail version of goofy financial engineering. ControlTheNarrative and friends would fit right in as investment-bank derivatives structurers or distressed credit-default-swap traders. The combination of attributes here—high risk tolerance, ethical flexibility, fanatical literalism, a sense of joy and play and pride in their creativity—is easily recognizable. This trade doesn’t tell you anything fundamental about the financial system, but the attitude behind it might. So much of what is interesting and important in finance really is, deep down, about finding ways to hack the game."

Lockup expires 11/14 too so sort of expecting the price to take a hit... which is making me want to yolo a lil harder at the 22s. Thoughts?"
