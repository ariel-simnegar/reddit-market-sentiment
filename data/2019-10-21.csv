Since then we’ve had recession fears from yield-curve inversions, decade-worst ISM data, trade tensions and tariffs rising, and we’re right back to where we were from hope for a soft Brexit which still hasn’t been priced out, hope still for the trade war to magically disappear, and better than expected earnings? I smell bullshit, and will be shorting SPY if we keep pushing this week and next leading to the Fed decision. Tough on China leading up to the APEC summit sounds about right.
