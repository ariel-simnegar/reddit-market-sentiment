Since then we’ve had recession fears from yield-curve inversions, decade-worst ISM data, trade tensions and tariffs rising, and we’re right back to where we were from hope for a soft Brexit which still hasn’t been priced out, hope still for the trade war to magically disappear, and better than expected earnings? I smell bullshit, and will be shorting SPY if we keep pushing this week and next leading to the Fed decision. Tough on China leading up to the APEC summit sounds about right.

>Nevertheless, ""the        United States also accounts for 40% of dollar millionaires        worldwide and for 40% of those in the top 1% of global wealth        distribution,"" the report found.       
>  
>China's rapid economic expansion and the ability of        well-connected elites to capture outsized returns has enabled China        to replace Europe        ""as the principal source of global wealth growth and to replace Japan        as the country with the second-largest number of millionaires,""        according to the Swiss bank's report.     

 

>The report found that aggregate global wealth rose by $9.1        trillion, or 2.6%, to $360.6 trillion. Globally,        there are 1.1 million new millionaires for a total of 46.8 million. More        than 60% of those new millionaires are American, while China        and Japan        each contributed just under 14% of the world's new millionaires.       
>  
>Australia now has 124,000 fewer millionaires in the wake of a        decline in wealth. The country saw a $28,670 drop in        wealth per adult, largely due to a combination of falling housing prices        and currency exchange rate changes."
