#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 

Re


#____________________


Asian markets are rallying hard, and they have broken upper end of their range, major indexes have made new highs of the after crash rally


**India** up 1.6% 

**Hangseng** up 3.81% 

**Nikkei** up  1.83%


#_____________________



Europe indices are in a similar scenario like Asian market and have their dong errect and clearly visible, major resistance have been broken here too

**Dax** up 1.98% 


**CAC40** up 1.95%


**FTSE** up 2.14%


#_____________________


**Dow** futures (26,177.0) +418.0(+1.62%)

#____________________

Global markets are as bullish as it gets, Asia have made new rally highs and Europe breaking their major resistance has made each and every indices on a bull trend

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Classic trend is your friend case thus we are avoiding to take any short position and are adding longs on dips, short chart suggests that we have transitioned from sell on rally to buy on dipa


Major support is still 305 and 307 and resistance is at 314 and 320, on long term charts, this excited me to core as 314 resistance have been broken in the future it self and that makes room for 320 test

I think we all will be surprised at the pace 320 will be seen


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 310 - 320 with an expectation that 310 becomes a short term psychological support

If 314 manages to hold it can prove to become a support as strong as 300



#____________________


**Longterm** : it is very difficult to be bearish in long term view when NASDAQ itself is making new highs, we believe that Nasdaq 10k support has become as strong as spy 300 support, thus we are strongly bullish on long term, but we request you to add long term stocks in SIP mode to benefit the current volitality


Here is the usual alert 

(Alert : avoid Russel stocks cause the economic condition most likely will make big companies bigger and will wipe out small companies, the directional difference between Nasdaq, Dow, S and p and Russel is likely to continue )


#______________________

It's not only about resistance and support, but the type of reversal or breakout that has taken place in those levels, seeing the sharp reversal from 300 has made us believe that taking shorts is out of the menu in near and medium term, here the market gave clear indication to where we are going




#____________________


Random tip for the day : ""expectations are the biggest reason for dissapointment  ""

https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/the-china-bull-is-stoking-the-risk-on-mood-in-markets-20200706

**The China bull is stoking the risk-on mood in markets**


**Chinese state media is pushing the narrative that a bull market is here**



""China equities are trading well higher on the day so far, with both the CSI 300 and the Shanghai Composite posting gains of over 4% currently.

What is even more impressive is that trading volumes are surging, with daily turnover exceeding ¬•1 trillion on Thursday and Friday last week - and likely to exceed that mark once again today. That represents a sign of surging risk appetite.

This comes on the back of news that  China International Capital Corp. is forecasting the stock market to double in the next 5-10 years while the Securities Times' said a ""healthy"" bull market is now more important to the economy than ever.

Frankly speaking, China trying to ""guide"" asset prices towards one direction isn't anything new and any state media narrative is often a strong hint of what local authorities are willing to do in order to support said narrative to turn it into reality.

......

While China is continuing to signal that they have moved on from the coronavirus, the more bullish tone is feeding into risk-on sentiment across markets today. However, coronavirus developments elsewhere are less than ideal or convincing.

Sure, the sheer exuberance could override fears for a day or two but it won't change the fact that we are still likely to see more pessimistic news over the next few weeks on virus developments elsewhere - especially the US - unless something changes.

...""

Real Bears don‚Äôt think it will rebound! Real bears think that shit is only worth 270 or less, and so after it crashes it‚Äôs also going to stay there for a long time too. 

If investors think it will just rally after a crash, then it‚Äôs not going to crash! Nobody is going to sell you their shit at a discount, deal with it.

""The Public Health Service released the virus cultures to vaccine  manufacturers on May 12, 1957, and a vaccine entered trials at Fort Ord  on July 26 and Lowry Air Force Base on July 27. Although the vaccine was  only available initially in limited quantities, it was rapidly deployed  and this helped to contain the pandemic. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was aware of the  impending pandemic, but he initially balked at starting a nationwide  government-supported vaccination program. But once he appreciated the  severity of the problem, in August of 1957, Eisenhower asked Congress  for $500,000 in funding and authorization to shift an additional $2  million, if needed, to fight the outbreak. He set a goal of 60 million  doses of vaccines, enough to vaccinate a third of the population, (which  was around 171 million at that time). By early November, about 40  million doses had been given, and the pandemic began losing steam.""

3) Testing continues to improve + antibody %‚Äôs likely significantly higher than ever expected 
4) Vaccine/treatment progress is being made
5) Continued positive job number surprises 
6) Fed committed to continued stimulus
7) Congress will begin working on next stimulus package likely starting this week ‚Äî they have no option other than to pass more stimulus
8) Kanye announcement reduces likelihood of Biden win ‚Äî with Biden leading in the polls this can only be a positive if Biden‚Äôs poll numbers start dipping 
9) The average person without preexisting conditions does not care about COVID anymore
10) Civil unrest has settled down 
11) US taking very measured/low risk approach towards China as it relates to new HK securities law
12) Buffet spending cash and starting to do deals again
13) Retail investors continue pouring into the markets (with now Asian millennials jumping in on the trend)
14) TSA data trends improving 
15) Liquidity is abundant 
16) Consumer confidence continues to surprise to the positive 
17) PMI data improving 
18) Homes sales data surging upward 
19) Acquisitions are still happening since capital is abundant 
20) Various successful IPOs recently so demand for new investments is there

Risks (low risks imo)

1) Congress doesn‚Äôt pass the next fiscal stimulus package in time (PPP loans are running out and extra unemployment benefits ending soon, so this is critical)
2) Increased China tensions

All those labeled as a leftist have been sent to the re-education camps in Fresno, CA. President Trump, after multiple delays, has halted elections indefinitely until order is restored, all leftists and those labeled as antifa are apprehended, and every street corner is dominated.

China has taken Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Japan announces it has implemented an accelerated nuclear arms program and that they will arm 5th nuclear submarines to patrol the South China Sea, warning that if their sovereignty is infringed, they will launch warheads into Beijing.

Russia's incursions into the Canadian arctic continue unimpeded, President Trump exclaims that this is between Canada and Russia and that the USA will not intervene, Canada orders it's military to garrison positions across Nunavut and the NWT, tensions there continue to rise.

South Korea and North Korea are now unified under the condition of complete expulsion of American troops, the Korean peninsula is under control of a now unified, pro China Korea.

‚Äòit‚Äôs enough, Jerome.‚Äô the voice whispers, ‚Äòsave some for the election‚Äô

Jerome swallows the amber liquid and lights a Virginia Slim. It dangles from his lip defiantly as he removes the hand.

I learned enough to buy one DIA 200 put that printed, and then I was hooked. I put about 5k into a Robinhood account and went up to 12k and back to 4k and then cashed that out. 

Then I realized I could trade in my Fidelity rollover 401k from a previous job and have been doing well. I know it's mostly luck, but the most valuable lessons I've learned are not to YOLO anything and that you really can't call yourself a bull or a bear unless you're talking a daily time horizon.

So the people who sell these contracts are buying up the underlying stock to cover their ass. More puts=push stonk higher.

The only exception to this are major failures. Like a medical company losing a patent or something. Or tesla getting kicked out of china.

So yes, its not all just ""Blind chance"" There's a reason for everything. And its not the experienced people who are making these retarded plays. It's joe who works in the same office as you do."

How the truth propagates, by Schopenhauer.

First, it is ridiculed.

Second, it is violently opposed.

Third, it is accepted as self-evident.

The problem is not that you're wrong, the problem is that you're buying at stage one or two.

Calls fit the established narrative, it isn't a challenge to the status quo, even if it's ""wrong"" for the market to be going up given variables that you're aware of.

Puts, on the other hand, challenge accepted norms, for a put to print, you must buy it EXACTLY between steps 2 and 3. It's a hard game."

If you are paying attention to futures and fighting over it in the comments, you are a straight up faggot. This has nothing to do with whether or not you like dick in the butt. This is not a derogatory term. You are just a simple faggot. A dislikable, whiny, shell of a person, bitching about some shit that doesn't matter. A simple faggot.

Whether or not you accept this, this is what you are. It gets you no closer to the goal that you are trying to achieve. Being a faggot really has no perks.

- US sends two aircraft carriers into South Gyna Sea as Gyna was conducting military exercises (7/4)
- Buffet buys natural gas stock (7/5)
- Coronavirus increases in FL, TX, and AZ top 10k, 8k, and 3.5k, respectively (7/6)

##Bear Week Prediction

* With a flight to quality last week (junk bonds to US 7-10 year Treasuries), market will ‚Äúfly‚Äù to quality. Quality seems to be US Treasuries, Mega-Tech (FANG), and Gold. Small cap will likely suffer most.

* For the 2nd week in a row, FED reduced balance sheet.
* Fear of earnings and fundamentals ahead, investors will move to cash to wait out earnings.
* Covid cases likely to reach 75k by end of week.

###Spy 295 EoW

* Death rate for covid not rising as anticipated.
* States are smarter about their lock-down practices; Statewide lock-down unlikely.

If true, this might be the easist free money anyone has ever made. $1000 of gold moves price up and nets Musky a couple hundred million valuation a week.

Hats off to Mr Delorean errr Musk."

2020-07-05 20:14:50,onlyeverdown,4,"We had a bunch of green days so probably there will be a red one now.

I think there's a lot of upward pressure on the market, but Covid is getting fucking horrible, so we'll probably see an even greater disparity between the NASDAQ and everything else.

Expecting my shitty positions to get even worse. Recovery by 2021 is plausible but not guaranteed.

Just my thoughts!!"
