My crystal ball tells me that in a few weeks, it will appear as though the curve will flatten and we'll be sent back to work. The problem is that a temporary flattening is just going to reverse once quarantine is lifted and everyone is going to live it up and be chilling like crazy since they're going stir crazy currently. We're not going to return to normal until there's either a vaccine, an extremely effective treatment, or herd immunity, which a quarantine prevents. 

Basically, social distancing is working but it only works when it's done for an extended period of time. You cant just scream Mission Accomplished a month later when the rates have gone down, which is exactly what Trump is getting hard for

We'll pump high but then when the second wave hits we'll go right back down even worse where we started both stonk and infection wise"
