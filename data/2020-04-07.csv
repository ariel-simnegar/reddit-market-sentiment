My crystal ball tells me that in a few weeks, it will appear as though the curve will flatten and we'll be sent back to work. The problem is that a temporary flattening is just going to reverse once quarantine is lifted and everyone is going to live it up and be chilling like crazy since they're going stir crazy currently. We're not going to return to normal until there's either a vaccine, an extremely effective treatment, or herd immunity, which a quarantine prevents. 

Basically, social distancing is working but it only works when it's done for an extended period of time. You cant just scream Mission Accomplished a month later when the rates have gone down, which is exactly what Trump is getting hard for

We'll pump high but then when the second wave hits we'll go right back down even worse where we started both stonk and infection wise"

2020-04-07 23:14:32,caldazar24,9,"I do think another leg down is in the cards but it will require one of the following triggers:

1- more NYC‚Äôs. NYC‚Äôs curve is flattening (deaths are up today but they lag new cases which have been sideways for days now), and the epidemic there is totally priced in. But NYC was our only Wuhan/Lombardy, when it looked like LA, SF, and others were on a similar path a couple weeks ago. But with little testing in a lot of states and shelter-in-place orders being late or lax in places like FL and AZ, there‚Äôs still the potential for a few more metro areas to explode.

2- major company goes through a high-profile bankruptcy thanks to corporate debt crisis. Would cause a lot of fear as nobody exactly knows where those dominos go. This is also the scenario that all the policy changes the past few weeks have been designed to avoid, but it‚Äôs conceivable a big player slips through the cracks for some reason.

3- May re-opening causing big second wave of infections and another shutdown 2-4 weeks later, making everyone re-price the epidemic as a 6-12 month impact. I believe current valuations imply the market thinks recovery will be not exactly V-shaped but that things will be pretty much back to normal by end Q2.

4- alternatively, in the world where governors listen to public health officials and announce shutdown will continue through July, the $1,200 will be long spent and people won‚Äôt be able to buy food or pay rent, at which point civil unrest becomes a non-trivial risk. Gov will try to pass another package to prevent this but based on how the last one turned out I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll do much to appease workers. Tendies aside I really really hope we avoid this scenario, but I don‚Äôt think the market has priced in LA ‚Äò92-level riots or worse in multiple cities across the country. 

5- Trump pulling a BoJo

6- China vs. US conflict seriously heating up. There‚Äôs a lot of words being thrown between the two countries now, but not a lot of risk of much more than that as it‚Äôs all posturing for domestic politics in both countries. However, given the egos of the men involved, there is a nonzero chance tensions between the two over responsibility for the virus escalates turn into a full-blown trade war, or even posturing for a possible kinetic war. As the crisis has shown a spotlight on how coupled our economy is with China‚Äôs, our economy is in no position to whether something like that and even a sharp verbal faceoff (like what Trump had with Kim Jong-Un) could spook the markets.


I‚Äôd put a ~10% chance each on #1 and #2, and a ~60% chance on #3, the rest having minimal probability but still being potential black swans that could trigger another round of what we saw in early March."
