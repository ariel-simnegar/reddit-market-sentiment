My crystal ball tells me that in a few weeks, it will appear as though the curve will flatten and we'll be sent back to work. The problem is that a temporary flattening is just going to reverse once quarantine is lifted and everyone is going to live it up and be chilling like crazy since they're going stir crazy currently. We're not going to return to normal until there's either a vaccine, an extremely effective treatment, or herd immunity, which a quarantine prevents. 

Basically, social distancing is working but it only works when it's done for an extended period of time. You cant just scream Mission Accomplished a month later when the rates have gone down, which is exactly what Trump is getting hard for

We'll pump high but then when the second wave hits we'll go right back down even worse where we started both stonk and infection wise"

they know we will be kept in the house for an undetermined amount of time so at the end of each extension period, the time will increase. they can’t just come out and say, “1 year social distancing “. people in america are too conditioned to having freedom and that would cause our country to go 3rd world with people doing anything they can to survive.

robberies are going up and soon we’ll be seeing military patrol the streets enforcing martial law to keep inside. 

kinda like in the movie: the village.

all the adults knew the deal, but all the younger ones were convinced there was a monster that comes every night so everyone is to keep inside. 

it worked, til that one chic found out it was all a lie to keep the society they created in central fucking park away from civilization. 

the future is out of everyone’s control. 

another little conspiracy, seems particular that all this happened during the australia fire. they fuckin used flamethrowers to rid the country of something. the smoke billowed all over the world and now covid.

2020-04-07 23:14:32,caldazar24,9,"I do think another leg down is in the cards but it will require one of the following triggers:

1- more NYC’s. NYC’s curve is flattening (deaths are up today but they lag new cases which have been sideways for days now), and the epidemic there is totally priced in. But NYC was our only Wuhan/Lombardy, when it looked like LA, SF, and others were on a similar path a couple weeks ago. But with little testing in a lot of states and shelter-in-place orders being late or lax in places like FL and AZ, there’s still the potential for a few more metro areas to explode.

2- major company goes through a high-profile bankruptcy thanks to corporate debt crisis. Would cause a lot of fear as nobody exactly knows where those dominos go. This is also the scenario that all the policy changes the past few weeks have been designed to avoid, but it’s conceivable a big player slips through the cracks for some reason.

3- May re-opening causing big second wave of infections and another shutdown 2-4 weeks later, making everyone re-price the epidemic as a 6-12 month impact. I believe current valuations imply the market thinks recovery will be not exactly V-shaped but that things will be pretty much back to normal by end Q2.

4- alternatively, in the world where governors listen to public health officials and announce shutdown will continue through July, the $1,200 will be long spent and people won’t be able to buy food or pay rent, at which point civil unrest becomes a non-trivial risk. Gov will try to pass another package to prevent this but based on how the last one turned out I’m not sure it’ll do much to appease workers. Tendies aside I really really hope we avoid this scenario, but I don’t think the market has priced in LA ‘92-level riots or worse in multiple cities across the country. 

5- Trump pulling a BoJo

6- China vs. US conflict seriously heating up. There’s a lot of words being thrown between the two countries now, but not a lot of risk of much more than that as it’s all posturing for domestic politics in both countries. However, given the egos of the men involved, there is a nonzero chance tensions between the two over responsibility for the virus escalates turn into a full-blown trade war, or even posturing for a possible kinetic war. As the crisis has shown a spotlight on how coupled our economy is with China’s, our economy is in no position to whether something like that and even a sharp verbal faceoff (like what Trump had with Kim Jong-Un) could spook the markets.


I’d put a ~10% chance each on #1 and #2, and a ~60% chance on #3, the rest having minimal probability but still being potential black swans that could trigger another round of what we saw in early March."

Wake up this morning and that same play would’ve netted me over 2grand if I wasn’t such a paper handed cuck and held it over night.

If you have options, exercising the ITM options is gonna be super interesting lol, if this halt lasts a few weeks.  It's actually super hard to know how to exercise these ITM options because you don't know what the halt is for exactly.

At open the V calls were up about 1.8k and the credit spread was down a few hundred cause SPY rocketed overnight. I held the V calls cause I got greedy and thought it would go higher today, and I took the 600+ loss on the credit spread. Well now, if I’d sold the V calls at open and held the credit spread I’d be up probably 2 grand on the day. Instead I’m up only 300 on the day.

2020-04-07 21:10:55,Kags1969,62,I went full tard and bought 30 SPY $260p 4/9.  This is the shortest put I have ever traded.  Up 67% in at $1.59.   I am guessing some folks will pull money off the table for the long weekend.   I also double up'd on my June 15 puts.   full tard.
2020-04-07 21:10:48,,177,"This is an addiction. I have never thought I'd be addicted to wsb, to losing money (and very rarely winning). Throughout the day  I look at stock prices incessantly, especially if I am in a position. I look at yahoo finance group, stocktwits, wsb, news, etc. Nonstop!  At night, I check futures, even though I know they don't  mean shit until market opens.  Losses led me to contemplating suicide; winnings gave me glimmers of early retirement.
