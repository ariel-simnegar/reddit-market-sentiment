2020-05-19 09:58:07,khanx290,11,"What is Inovio's track record?

During the 2009 swine flu, Inovio developed an experimental vaccine called SynCon and presented evidence that 100% of pigs vaccinated with SynCon did not catch the swine origin H1N1 virus.¬†Since SynCon achieved success in pre-clinical models, it was forwarded to phase 1 clinical trials for testing in humans.¬†Upon the release of the news in July 2009, Inovio's stock nearly tripled in the span of one month.

Ôøº
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Three years after the outbreak ended, the company released the results from its phase 1 trial. SynCon demonstrated immune-response levels similar to a seasonal flu vaccine. Inovio also disclosed its vaccine was not matched to the then-circulating H1N1 strain.¬†Afterwards, this vaccine was never heard from again. Inovio's stock had fallen by nearly half when the outbreak dissipated in August 2010.¬†
In 2013, the H7N9 avian flu broke out in China, infecting a total of 394 people and killing 120 by March 2014.¬†Inovio issued a press release that said 100% of vaccinated mice were protected from the illness when they were given its immunotherapy vaccine.¬†In 2015, the company disclosed in its SEC filings that it was still seeking funding for its H7N9 program. Non-diplomatic translation: the project was shelved.¬†
Investors may start to notice a pattern. During an infectious disease outbreak, Inovio announces it has developed a vaccine for the responsible virus strain. It presents data of up to 100% response rates in early studies, only to table its vaccine program for the said disease after the outbreak ends.

Ôøº
IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS

If you're still not convinced this is a pattern, let's fast forward to the next few instances.
In 2014, Inovio announced it was moving its Ebola vaccine into clinical trials in preparation¬†for the West Africa Ebola outbreak after achieving a 100% response rate in guinea pigs and mice. Meanwhile, it didn't mention the vaccine again until 2018, during the Kivu Ebola virus outbreak. Then, the company announced its vaccine achieved 100% response rates in early studies. However, no further progress involving the vaccine has been announced.¬†
When the Zika and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses broke out in 2015 and 2016 respectively, Inovio announced its vaccine achieved 100% antibody response in study participants. When the outbreaks were over, no news of the vaccines' advancement to phase 3 or FDA approval came, and the projects were shelved, until now.¬†
Just recently, Inovio disclosed that the company's vaccine against the MERS coronavirus (not the current COVID-19) demonstrated 92% to 100% response rates in phase 1. Inovio believes these results show its COVID-19 vaccine will witness similar success in clinical trials.¬†
In all, during the span of the past decade, Inovio has claimed it has developed a vaccine for nearly every single major disease outbreak. However, none of its vaccines ever made it to phase 3 or received FDA approval. Previous investors who bought Inovio's stock hoping a successful vaccine would be developed in time found the outbreaks subsided before it could happen."
