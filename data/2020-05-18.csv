2020-05-19 09:58:07,khanx290,11,"What is Inovio's track record?

During the 2009 swine flu, Inovio developed an experimental vaccine called SynCon and presented evidence that 100% of pigs vaccinated with SynCon did not catch the swine origin H1N1 virus.¬†Since SynCon achieved success in pre-clinical models, it was forwarded to phase 1 clinical trials for testing in humans.¬†Upon the release of the news in July 2009, Inovio's stock nearly tripled in the span of one month.

Ôøº
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Three years after the outbreak ended, the company released the results from its phase 1 trial. SynCon demonstrated immune-response levels similar to a seasonal flu vaccine. Inovio also disclosed its vaccine was not matched to the then-circulating H1N1 strain.¬†Afterwards, this vaccine was never heard from again. Inovio's stock had fallen by nearly half when the outbreak dissipated in August 2010.¬†
In 2013, the H7N9 avian flu broke out in China, infecting a total of 394 people and killing 120 by March 2014.¬†Inovio issued a press release that said 100% of vaccinated mice were protected from the illness when they were given its immunotherapy vaccine.¬†In 2015, the company disclosed in its SEC filings that it was still seeking funding for its H7N9 program. Non-diplomatic translation: the project was shelved.¬†
Investors may start to notice a pattern. During an infectious disease outbreak, Inovio announces it has developed a vaccine for the responsible virus strain. It presents data of up to 100% response rates in early studies, only to table its vaccine program for the said disease after the outbreak ends.

Ôøº
IMAGE SOURCE: YCHARTS

If you're still not convinced this is a pattern, let's fast forward to the next few instances.
In 2014, Inovio announced it was moving its Ebola vaccine into clinical trials in preparation¬†for the West Africa Ebola outbreak after achieving a 100% response rate in guinea pigs and mice. Meanwhile, it didn't mention the vaccine again until 2018, during the Kivu Ebola virus outbreak. Then, the company announced its vaccine achieved 100% response rates in early studies. However, no further progress involving the vaccine has been announced.¬†
When the Zika and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses broke out in 2015 and 2016 respectively, Inovio announced its vaccine achieved 100% antibody response in study participants. When the outbreaks were over, no news of the vaccines' advancement to phase 3 or FDA approval came, and the projects were shelved, until now.¬†
Just recently, Inovio disclosed that the company's vaccine against the MERS coronavirus (not the current COVID-19) demonstrated 92% to 100% response rates in phase 1. Inovio believes these results show its COVID-19 vaccine will witness similar success in clinical trials.¬†
In all, during the span of the past decade, Inovio has claimed it has developed a vaccine for nearly every single major disease outbreak. However, none of its vaccines ever made it to phase 3 or received FDA approval. Previous investors who bought Inovio's stock hoping a successful vaccine would be developed in time found the outbreaks subsided before it could happen."

On a serious note the US has moved from the shocking reality of COVID-19.

It was bad at first because no one prepared for stuff like this and everything was closing down; nor did the reaction of the people going into apocalypse mode make it any better.

All the articles of people saying there will be another ‚Äú20% drop‚Äù are written by the same firms writing you those put contracts, knowing there are people stuck on the crash mentality and praying for it to happen again.

If you can own a piece of one of the monopolies / global duopolies in a world where earnings only go up, it becomes pretty clear why bulls are going nuts. MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, BABA, BIDU, you‚Äôd be fucking nuts not to want the next decade of earnings from these titans even if it means paying a premium for a sure thing.

They better raise money as early as it can rather than later. They do this now b/c the stock market overall now has a good momentum and also to prevent bullshitters saying this company does not have cash later down the stage. The other thing is its very common practice for biotechs to raise cash by selling stocks especially after release of good data. Go fucking look at every other biotechs. Even when they don't have any data coming out, they raise cash by selling stocks even the $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, etc biotech stocks. Plus the after-hours price action after releasing the stock sale news is only down 4%. Just logically think about what that means... If you are that fucking confident that Moderna is a 'scam', 'hello sec', 'bullshit', 'just pump and dump', etc, put your money where your mouth is by selling short or buy puts. Also, pumping and dumping works for low price stocks and not this Moderna type of stock where there are so much focus and attention from everyone in the world and high dollar stock.

In doing so, we embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as **transparent** as possible. We are deeply committed to **transparency**, and recognize that the need for **transparency** is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers. This is particularly the case when Congress appropriates taxpayer funds to back lending programs that the Fed administers. In connection with the CARES Act facilities‚Äîincluding the two corporate credit facilities, the Main Street Lending Program, the Municipal Liquidity Facility, and the TALF‚Äîwe will be disclosing, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility.

2020-05-19 00:03:18,IS_JOKE_COMRADE,13,"I always like to think about things I could do they would have an impact on the world, one of the ideas I consistently return to in my head is a sort of extreme minimalist dormitory system for adults. 

Imagine, he situation where for a very small amount of money, you could rent an apartment that was micro. Like, a fold down bed, a small desk, and that‚Äôs it. TV on the wall, basics. Shared shower facilities, shared cooking facilities. A pretty big building though, think of a situation like honeycombed floors of units.

The idea would be that you can live for very minimal amounts of money, with no need to buy things to fill up a house. You achieve these savings by having a minimalist footprint, with a shared community. Of course, you would have to sign onto a strict set of rules to enable cohabitation in close quarters like this, but I wonder how many people out there would be OK with that. 

Imagine if you paid 20% of the rent you currently pay, you didn‚Äôt need to earn anything, you just had to have mutual respect for other people. It would be like a millennial monastery almost. Think about the types of people that go for financial independence, that sort of thing. There would be a building monitor, I wonder if this sort of thing could thrive in high cost of living areas

Like imagine you graduate college and you could live for almost dirt cheap not have to buy much at all, and allow you to live like a fucking Baller for a few years or save money like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business"

6 Reasons I Bought S&P 500 Puts
May 18, 2020 4:00 PMSPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY)AMZN, APPL, FB
Summary

I expect a 15% drop for the S&P 500 in the next 3 months.
The reopening of the economy is triggering more social contact, which increases the transmission of the coronavirus.
We could see a spike in coronavirus cases by June, which may lead to backtracking on the economic reopening.
Other risks include falling earnings estimates and a shift in investor sentiment.
I bought SPY puts as a play on this thesis

For Bulls: 

The sharp rise of today's market has scared potential sellers who now want to be along for the ride upwards. Hoping not to miss the boat, more buyers pile in, pushing SPY above 296.5 before the morning bell has rung. Excitement at having pushed to new highs after more than a month of trying leads SPY to close comfortably at 300.5. Futures are slightly green the night after and stay that way. 

For Bears:

The market has gone up much too quickly in the past few market days. Thursday and Friday were green despite massive selling pressure, and now Monday is up +3%. This sudden increase has triggered substantial profit-taking, but profit-taking turns to selling-off as SPY drops from 295 at open to 293, and then to 289 at close. Potential buyers are worried that SPY just saw a triple top, and those still holding are too. Selling off continues into Wednesday. 

For Theta:

I get a feeling we test 300 this week, but given that level's psychological affect and the 200 SMA is sitting there right now I don't see us going through. I think today + this week could be just a short squeeze to 300 and then we drift down, not sure where to though. This rally seems exhausted as people have been piling in shorts since 280, 300 I think we'd see a lot more conviction to short there as well. Still think we're going to have limited downside (after I've lost a bunch of money to figure that out) until Q2 - becoming more convinced that Q2 earnings are where we'll start to understand the longer-term economic impacts and I'm going to be short going into that and will try to be theta gang until then"

I also have long dated SPY puts ITM (August and beyond) that I hold as plunge protection, and the premiums I make selling these shorter covered SPY puts basically covers the cost of opening them and then some.

You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural asset is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another asset.
