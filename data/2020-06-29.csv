Short covering means that the trade has been earlier shorted and in order to square of their positions, they had to buy. Since there were so many short positions created in the market, people started buying, and that leaded to the market going positive. Since so many people were buying, this created a temporary rise in the price of the stock. This price rise was only because people were covering positions.

Bloomberg also reported it yesterday:

>Hedge Funds Are Rushing to Get Out of Bearish U.S. Stock Bets - Bloomberg  
>  
>Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding in the $266 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust had fallen to 4.9% Friday from 6.7% at the end of May, according to data from IHS Markit. Meanwhile, the beta of the Hedge Fund Research Macro/CTA Index -- which tracks funds synonymous with trend-following quant strategies -- to the S&P 500, is back above zero for the first time since March. That suggests CTA funds have been boosting their exposure to U.S. equities and closing short positions."

This is the last ten trading days of spy.  We are in a downtrend, and that downtrend is going to continue until something large changes.

Right now we‚Äôre at (or were at, thanks futures for illustrating) the high point of this chart.  We‚Äôre going to oscillate down to about 298-7 this time.  Buy puts, get out of them by 298, wait a day, buy calls and ride to 304, then get off and reverse.
 
If something big happens, cash out and wait for the winds to tell you where we‚Äôre going.  If Powell announces any *new* measures, buy spy 275p and pray."

That's really weird to me. It makes me think the bar/arcade/entertainment company that is PLAY is being lumped into the same risk index as the pure airline travel company SAVE and is being traded on some factor that has nothing to do with the company or its business itself. In the last 10-Q itself they said they have doubts of their continued existence in this hostile environment and for the past, oh, 10 days it's been seeing massive swings of 5-10% every day! I know Cramer uses PLAY and Winnebago as bellwethers for discretionary sentiment, but I wonder if other major institutions are using it as a proxy for sentiment. Something has to be up because it's trading completely off the rails vs fundamentals or even the cosmic voodoo of TA. It's probably a dream to be day trading hour by hour right now. Thoughts?

I see 500 bearish posts per day about cases. Here‚Äôs reality for you;

Yes, the economy is fucked but it‚Äôs being propped up. It‚Äôll drop either around Q2 earnings or post election. Or maybe not, maybe they‚Äôll just prop it up forever, it‚Äôs uncertain whether they can pull that off. It‚Äôs unlikely - but not impossible. We‚Äôre in unprecedented times with fed actions.

The initial shock happened in back in March, when everyone thought we would have MILLIONS DEAD. Ergo, the market DOES NOT CARE ABOUT NEW CASES. It‚Äôs priced in. Also, cases are not a good measure of anything, they are dependent on testing. ICUs are full yeah, but guess what? In major cities ICUs are always fucking full. Yes Covid is serious, but this was still a massive overreaction, it‚Äôs never going to turn into a thing where even close to 1% of the population dies, regardless of people ignoring guidelines. The media is bamboozling you and as a result you‚Äôre bleeding your account dry. Do yourself a favor and stop. WHEN the downturn starts, THEN you can get it on puts. Yes you‚Äôll miss the initial drop but there will still be plenty of money to be made, and you won‚Äôt have as many losses to make up for."

I have no real predictions for tomorrow. 2% +/- is priced in to premiums anyway, so the real plays were (and probably will be tomorrow) intraday. 

I don't trust this green day. It was light. FB's baby bitch bounce was pathetic, leading me to believe it's a trap. SPY had no balls, but rarely does.  Only grabbed more calls because they was cheep cheep ($0.05) and why not?

The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, ""This being is like a thick snake"". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, ""is a wall"". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

2020-06-29 23:29:23,rustplayer83,4,"JUST BUY ALL THE DEBT:

To help state and local governments better manage cash flow pressures in order to continue to serve households and businesses in their communities, the Federal Reserve, together with the Treasury Department, established the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF). The MLF is backed by $35 billion of CARES Act equity and has the capacity to purchase up to $500 billion of short-term debt directly from U.S. states, counties, cities, and certain multistate entities. The facility became operational on May 26, and, to date, the MLF has purchased $1.2 billion worth of short-term municipal debt. With the MLF and other facilities in place as a backstop to the private market, many parts of the municipal bond market have significantly recovered from the unprecedented stress experienced earlier this year. Municipal bond yields have declined considerably, issuance has been robust over the past two months, and market conditions have improved.3

The tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are for times of emergency, such as the ones we have been living through. When economic and financial conditions improve, we will put these tools back in the toolbox."

> We meet as the pandemic continues to cause tremendous hardship, taking lives and livelihoods both at home and around the world. This is a global public health crisis, and we remain grateful to our health-care professionals for delivering the most important response, and to our essential workers who help us meet our daily needs. These dedicated people put themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country.

> Beginning in March, the virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real gross domestic product, or GDP, in the second quarter is likely to be the largest on record. The arrival of the pandemic gave rise to tremendous strains in some essential financial markets, impairing the flow of credit in the economy and threatening an even greater weakening of economic activity and loss of jobs.

May be red Wednesday but green tomorrow, I hold strangles so I honestly don‚Äôt care as long as we move but this may be helpful for the super bulls, looks like the bulls will be winning tomorrow but still not sure. 

Just no more flat shit Jesus Christ. 

Edit: I have strangles so I don‚Äôt care as long as there‚Äôs a move which will be happening but I believe this week will be somewhat green based off today, we‚Äôll see tomorrow as well. However as cases start to rise and states see a mandatory shutdown, or even more restrictions this leads to more bearish news especially if the tech giants fail. Or it could just be no bearish news and new stimulus talks happens within the month or toward the end of July resulting in a rally back up to 320, 330 levels before a bearish drop or a complete rally to ATH‚Äôs.

If, by Rudyard Kipling.

If you can keep your head when all about you¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†¬† Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,¬†¬†¬†

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

¬†¬†¬† But make allowance for their doubting too;¬†¬†¬†

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

¬†¬†¬† Or being lied about, don‚Äôt deal in lies,

Or being hated, don‚Äôt give way to hating,

¬†¬†¬† And yet don‚Äôt look too good, nor talk too wise:


If you can dream‚Äîand not make dreams your master;¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†¬† If you can think‚Äîand not make thoughts your aim;¬†¬†¬†

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

¬†¬†¬† And treat those two impostors just the same;¬†¬†¬†

If you can bear to hear the truth you‚Äôve spoken

¬†¬†¬† Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

¬†¬†¬† And stoop and build ‚Äôem up with worn-out tools:


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

¬†¬†¬† And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

¬†¬†¬† And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

¬†¬†¬† To serve your turn long after they are gone,¬†¬†¬†

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

¬†¬†¬† Except the Will which says to them: ‚ÄòHold on!‚Äô


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†¬† Or walk with Kings‚Äînor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

¬†¬†¬† If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

¬†¬†¬† With sixty seconds‚Äô worth of distance run,¬†¬†¬†

Yours is the Earth and everything that‚Äôs in it,¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†¬† And‚Äîwhich is more‚Äîyou‚Äôll be a Man, my son!

Puts forever, Wakanda forever!"

I think that the pull back in advertising is the canary in the coal mine for potential solvency issues at companies. These companies are reducing spending not because they believe in anything (they don't), they're reducing it because they clearly don't see a justifiable ROI on the ad spend at least for a quarter. It's no coincidence that this is all being announced at the end of Q2. The drop is spending is going to come back, eventually, but I think what's really going on is that the pull back in ad spending is a leading indicator of reduced aggregate demand in the economy. 

The US depends on consumer spending, often leveraged consumer spending. But if companies aren't willing to pay to mindfuck you into buying shit you don't need, even if you don't have the money to pay for it, it says something that we should listen to."

ZM is at P/E 2500+ and Hertz flew up hundreds of percent after catastrophic bankruptcy news. If you trade based on ""priced in,"" prepare to get fucked. If you think the market won't eventually care about catastrophic Covid numbers, you're going to get fucked.

It wasn't even my best performance, I sold my calls too early this morning and missed like 800$ more from my theta side of things, and I missed the sweet spot my near daily nkla put sell before I buy it back in the afternoon for a couple hundred less just due to my own uncertainty of what way things were gonna go this morning (I mean, $70 is $70 but if I had sold when I usually do it would've been $300). But ultimately, things worked out well enough for me, even if it's basically just like Friday never happened and I'm back to eod Thursday. Excited for tomorrow boys, let's print some shit."

I was looking to buy some puts all day on sq. I proceeded to watch it sell off all day, lower and lower and lower. I was like fuck it, bought 100p FDs (what else would I buy?) at 3:29. About 10 seconds later I see a surge of volume (big scary green dildo, biggest one i've ever seen). I then watched for the next 20 minutes as more green dildos popped up on my screen and then decided to sell for a -30% loss. Wow, what a fucking retard right? I literally could not have lost so much money in such a short amount of time if I tried, unless i threw the money in a fire. Anyway, after not being able to contain my frustration and feeling like my head was about to explode I immediately decided, fuck it, and yolod $2500 (I have a small account) on MU FD calls. thank you lisa su
