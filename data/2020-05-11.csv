I ask if she’s been drinking and she says “No”. 
Whatever. I notice a blood clot on her arm and ask what it’s from “From IV training at work” 
Odd. She’s been off for 2 days and it looks fresh.  

We lay down and she passes out 10 minutes into the movie. She starts talking in her sleep, starts coughing, and then starts throwing up. 


I run to the restroom to get the empty trash can and she proceeds to keep throwing up on the bed.  I help her remove the sheets and she goes to take a shower. It’s late and I’m ready to go, but wait to make sure she’s alright. 


I go to the bathroom to piss before I leave and see a fresh drug needle with bloody toilet paper in the trash can that was previously empty. 

I don’t know what she was shooting up and don’t care. I just left. 

Every nurse, dentist, doctor, lawyer, teacher, property manager, and recruiter I’ve ever dated have all been the absolute worst.

Average income is 60K USD in US. Without commute and eating out it is likely avg person will save 10% of his/her income. Let's say 1/3 of 120M population will say proactively invest in stonks because there is nothing else with a better return. So you are looking 240B USD annualized that will be invested in stonks.I believe in this environment FOMO is inevitable. You know you need to smash that spy 300C at open tomorrow.

[Check it homies](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/csod/after-hours):

- From 16:00-16:02, after market volume is 9625 all bought for $35.99 each 

- Then, from 16:11-17:09 the price slowly creeps up from small buys here and there to touch $37.01 each and head back to around $35-36

- Keep in mind the earnings happens at 5pm

- Then, between 17:09-20:00 (after market closes) 910 total shares are traded, slowly bringing the price down to $33.50. Incredibly low volume of people slowly selling here and there after market.

Now, what this means for tomorrow is uncertain. Almost no after market buying after earnings are announced, but also very very little selling. It took just around $30,000 worth of trading to bring the price down slowly. I'm holding my calls still, regardless."

A few I’m thinking about:
SPY$340 9/18 seems realistic, seeing as it took 4 months to pump from 10/2019 @ $294 to 2/2020 @ $397.

AMZN $3000 5/29 has some big dick volume recently, which I find odd because $3000 6/5 contracts aren’t available yet... seems like a buy besides the fact that the premium alone could buy me a sculpture of Warren Buffet getting jerked off by Monica Lewinsky.

PTON $60 7/17 $1.30c contracts seems cheap as fuck considering the last month of growth, plus the company has been tested through the gauntlet at this point. I can’t imagine them going anywhere but up since their commercial debauchery.

Also, will someone tell me what the fuck is happening with VTIQ tomorrow? Was thinking of buying 100 shares and hedging with $13 5/15 FD puts. Feels like it’s going wayyy up or back down to ~$13."

A lot of people can die from natural causes in a couple of months.  And if all of those deaths are from the devil, and not heart disease, or stroke, it makes it seem like a bigger deal than it needs to be.

They aren't going to the hospital because they are afraid.

Nobody hears about births or recoveries, just death.

Empty streets and news of death makes the death stand out more.

BNTX is still undervalued (11b market cap) compared to Moderna (25b) despite having dozens of cancer immunotherapy lined up

Is it because the options contract premiums themselves would be so high due to the volatility that it makes it hard to be profitable?

pre corona it had been obliterated on a bad earnings from mid 30s to 20s, drifting low as 16ish and back to 20s a couple times. then corona sent it to 6. as of 2 days ago it returned to pre-corona price of around 18. 

in about 1.5 months before corona it looked like it was being accumulated on a flat line around 20. like it was getting ready to retrace back toward 30. but then corona hit. so now im thinking it could go up again"

2020-05-11 23:50:13,EphemeralMoiety,-2,"**$CHFS – sleeper COVID play, earnings tomorrow**

CHF Solutions ($CHFS) makes a FDA-approved device called Aquadex that filter excess fluid out of your bloodstream. The doodad sells for $31,000, but the real money-maker is the $900 filters that get changed regularly and between patients.

Why is this a COVID play? Because COVID fucks up the fluid balance in your body that are difficult to manage. With Aquadex, your doctor hooks you up to the filter and it manages the water content of your bloodstream automatically. [The WHO designated fluid management as a key problem in effective COVID treatment.](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/330893)

Before COVID, CHF struggled to get these things into hospitals. But now, Aquadex units are selling like hotcakes. CHF has had to [rapidly scale up their production](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-doubles-production-staff-aquadex-smartflowtm) to keep up with demand. In NYC alone, they have [increased the number of units by 300%.](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-announces-300-increase-utilization-aquadex-therapy) Doctors love these things because the automated fluid management frees up MD/nurse staff/dialysis so they can treat the trillion other patients flooding their ER. It also more controlled than diuretic medications and avoids side effects. Once the units are in hospitals, they will get used and those $900 filters keep getting rolled out the door.

This company has a shit history and it's because management is shit. It struggled to get on its feet early on, flip-flopping between products and reverse splitting its stock to hell to stay compliant (just look at the price history lol). Further, they really failed in marketing a great product. If you look at their balance sheet for last year, they burn tons of cash on admin and marketing without much to show for it. I think, for those reasons, a lot of investors – myself included – were or are not bullish on management long-term. However, COVID is turning out to be the exposure they needed to push product and for once they got their thumb out of their asses and started printing filters. 

I picked up 2000 shares last week at their low. Might pick up some more in premarket before earnings are done. I'll probably dump most after earnings, although depending on how things go I might hold some through COVID – I'm thinking next quarter will also be stellar.

(I'm long 2000 CHFS although I might pick up a few thousand tomorrow premarket)"

Severe COVID seems to affect under immunized or unimunized populations.  Specifically:
- people over 50
- infants under 12 months
- Italians but not germans
In fact, in Europe, by country, rates of COVID severity seem inversely correlated with MMR vaccination rates: 
Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 6.19.21 PM.png
The real cool thing, though, is maybe the USS Rosevelt.  On that boat, virtually all sailors had had the MMR vaccine recently (military policy).  955 Sailors are positive for COVID, and there is only ONE hospitalization.  Hospitalization rates are much higher than this in the lay population (probably -per me- 10%, per the CDC the rate is 14-20% for people ages 20-44).

Tl;dr:  MMR vaccine might be providing some protection from COVID"

My motto is “take profit when happy and buy back in”

Sometimes I’ll buy and sell the same contract a couple of times a day. I make less money than others here because of it but I also keep my account safe. 

I take losses all the time out of fear, if I would wait a couple hours or a day I would be positive on the trade. That being said, I’d rather take the loss and watch the charts to find another entry point over losing more money. 

It’s all timing and I’m wrong a lot but my wins outweigh my losses by a lot.

>In an effort to explain the rising U.S. death toll, President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he blamed the nation’s susceptibility to coronavirus on the weakness of America’s race-muddled gene pool. “It’s sad to say, but decades of rampant miscegenation have watered down our superior genetics to the point that we’re completely defenseless against our invisible enemy,” said Trump, arguing that widespread intermingling had made the U.S.’s Covid-19 response more challenging compared to countries with less-tainted bloodlines such as Australia and Iceland. “We’ve done a very good job, but unfortunately, there’s only so much we can do when so many are tainted by DNA from the mongrel races. Folks, I’ve been saying it for years: The moment we got rid of the one-drop rule, we signed our own death warrants.” Trump went on to call for all full-blooded Aryans to donate plasma in an effort to help return America to its racially pure heyday.
