What markets are looking for is a coordinated effort in the US like the BoE unveiled. On the CB front, not just rate cuts but a special financing facility to help businesses. On the virus, we need to see containment measures on the domestic front to help stop the spread rather than scapegoating a ""foreign"" virus and banning flight from Europe. The speech was so poorly received because WH is still acting like this is not a US problem and that the virus will disappear when it gets warmer. Markets are now pricing in unabated, uncertain spread in the US knowing we are not taking it seriously or doing anything to slow down its spread (e.g., why the fuck is Disney still open).

TL;DR 4/17 or later Puts. Pick a stock it will die. üåà üêª ü§í 

COVID-19 cases fall roughly into 3 groups. 80% need no hospitalization, 15% need a bed but not in the ICU and 5% need an ICU bed ie ventilation. 

Cases in western countries (can‚Äôt trust numbers out of China) have shown doubling every 3-4 days. Going by today‚Äôs numbers, we can expect around 2 million cases by early April. 

Why does 2 million cases matter? 5% of 2mm is 100,000, which just happens to be the number of ICU beds in them entire US. Once they fill up, shit hits the fan. People get sent home to die, social media freaks the fuck out. This can happen earlier, but these are the limits on the healthcare system. 


This all assumes that no quarantine or lockdown measures will take place. If they lock down urban centers, congrats. Your puts just printed like JPOW when he sees a dip. People will freak and panic will drill down the market."

You are required to adjust for wash sales that occur as a result of trading in all accounts, including the IRA. Selling in normal brokerage, and buying in IRA can trigger this.

If you have more than 5k to 10k in RH and you're looking to trade a few times a day, you should consider moving on. If you have more than 25k, you should definitely move to a different platform. If you have more than 250k in RH, you're just being silly and losing money to poor fills and risking your funds to a wacky operation.

Because now with that NBA news and Tom Hanks news, everybody in the US will take this seriously and treat it as if our real numbers are similar to Italy.

So within the next few days, if we see a complete panic, we could end up pricing in the worst scenario instead of just a range of scenarios with some hopeful outcomes baked in...

By next week, I'm thinking markets could be very bleak and that means we could get to the point where even the real numbers won't spook markets.

Just some thoughts on the process of bottoming.  It's just important to try to be nimble around these things; markets typically bottom when bearish sentiment reaches its peak and that will happen well before the coronavirus actually peaks in the US."

2020-03-12 02:45:34,xesus2019,2,"OK, so the other day people were talking about, what will ""peak fear"" look like, and when will we know we're past it.

Clearly the Dow NASDAQ and S&P can keep drop drop dropping all the way down to the nub. It was MONOPOLY MONEY, people were gambling, capitalism doesn't really work that way, does it? Now COMPANY X can tell you how very profitable they were last quarter and everybody gets a dividend, but now that everyone and I mean everyone is scrambling for the hills, golden parachutes need to be paid for, chances are NEXT quarter, there will be no profits and no dividends.

So all STOCK money can go to zero.

BONDS are so overbought that the yield is going down to near-zero, as well. You really think the US Government, who has a 22 trillion dollar deficit when the economy is as good as it's ever going to get, is going to repay you that $10,000 of bond money ten years from now? There won't BE a ten years from now America at this rate, I guarantee it!

And people say, PEAK FEAR will be when there are so many dead bodies in the homes, that the ambulance services can't keep up, when the whole neighborhood has that dead-body AMMONIA smell. That will be Peak Fear.

Or maybe it gets EVEN WORSE from there, I dunno.

What do you, WSB, think PEAK FEAR looks like?"

Today everything seems to go in the wrong direction. I will profit a little out of it, but don't forget that you don't bring money with you when you die and money will not replace your beloved ones.


Stay safe out there."

2020-03-11 23:41:59,Send_Lawyers,23,"Reasons the market is going to tank for the next 3 weeks a theory. 

TLDR SPY 200P 4/6 and SPY100P 5/15 We will be lucky to not go below SPY 100 by June. I hope I am wrong. The math says we're fucked.   


1. Nothing is stopping the rona short term. That shit will hurt all business period. No news story, or magic cure or anything is going to stop people from getting sick and dying in large numbers over the next 14 days. Sorry Boomers. Please don't die Mom...   

2. The above is going to overwhelm our medical system which is already mostly broken. Hospitals are operating with historic low levels of open beds, TODAY. 20% of COVID-19 cases can require hospitalization. We don't have any extra beds for these people. This will cause panic because when the hospitals are full and anyone gets sick for anything they are screwed. See italy today...   
Up to 150 million Americans are expected to contract the coronavirus, congressional doctor says. Roughly 20% of cases require hospital beds that is.... 30 million hospital beds we don't have. We might have like 1.5 million...   

3. Next on the bad news team is that 4% of folks die. So out of 100 million Americans, 4 million die. 6 million if 150mil get it. 6 million Americans is 2% of the population. That is more than the percentage of Americans killed in all of WW2. That is up there with WORLDWIDE casualties from WW2 (3% of the global population). This bullet point right here is why PRC went full roman soldier on WUHAN with beatings for leaving your house. Their percentage if the contagion spread out of control would be legion. Ask Italy and Iran how this is going...  

4.  So we have a huge portion of the elderly needing hospital beds they don't have. No one can get sick or injured and expect treatment because every hospital in the nation is going to look like a MASH unit from the Korean war. AND no one wants to get this shit, so people STOP GOING OUT. That's right. Think anyone is buying cars/doughnuts/houses, or fuck all in Italy right now? Nope. 30 days minimum no major purchases spending or much more besides Netflix and chill alone eating frozen waffles. OH and planes travel stops and the borders might close. Sounds like things that might hurt the bottom line....  

5. Our entire leadership team is the prime target for this virus. So what happens when they get it...   

6. I could go on down the path of what will happen when we go full tilt on this. 43 million Americans don't have health insurance. 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. I hope they can afford a month of no work... The downward pressure on 330 million people will be immense NO ONE is going to profit here.  

7. You can't leadership or money this problem away anymore. A general Quarantine like North Korea might have worked back in early FEB like the PRC did, but honestly,as I can't see Americans taking this shit seriously even as I type this. The YOLO answer is almost better because the national nightmare will be over quicker but with many more dead.  

8. If you read this far get ready for the nightmare shit.  

9. The Banks CAN NOT HANDLE THIS. SO much of the banking empire is built on growth, month after month of no growth is going to destroy dozens of industries filled with high debt corporations. The oil sector is the canary in the coal mine. What happens when the retail sector curls up and dies. or the hospitality sector. When all those corps default on their loans the balance sheets on the banks will go poof. THIS IS WORSE THAN 2008. Liquidity is already a problem, but solvency is a bigger one.   

10. We have had 33 deaths so far and markets down 20% what happens at 5000 or 20,000. Maybe nothing. The flu kills up to 61K every year. BUT remember bullet point number 3. 4 million.... Yeah that might impact the average company.  


Thanks for reading. I hope you all struggle to sleep as much as I do now. If we dead cat tomorrow grab up them SPY puts. It's GOING DOWN."

It's hard to tell though, I only made a small play today buying some 3/13 SPY 300c at the lows and selling before EOD for a quick 60% profit.

I want to see if we can get another big bounce going though before I load up on more puts.  The big escalation in coronavirus cases will be coming next week, and it could set us up for a worst case scenario that isn't fully priced in yet...  Even rates falling back to 0% and expectations of QE probably can't stop another leg down if that comes to pass.

Patience is still the name of the game imo.  Scalping dead cat bounces makes the most sense right now until we get a lot more clarity on what the next month looks like."

Global supply chains have gone fucky already and companies are already slashing marketing and sales and shoring up credit lines.

2020-03-11 21:47:55,freehouse_throwaway,7,"posted this before (maybe a week ago during some weekend thread?) but here's an update.

individual equity STILL richly valued that i've been following for years:

**LULU** - currently at pricing from last ER (Nov). drilled from 260s. still up 33% from a 1 year mark. they closed their 38 stores in China since Feb 3 (some were in a reduced schedule). that's a full month of rev gone. for ref, during height of trade war + rate hike combo, (Dec 2018), LULU was trading as low as $113.

rode Apr 200p on it from worthless to $12. rolled some to shorter March 200p on the recent rebound and IV crush (mentioned this in a daily thread as well). 200p 3/20 was as low as $1.7. It's now $6 ITM. (last close price was $14)

I'm all out of my position, but if they float above $200 again i would entertain $180p for Apr which captures upcoming end of month ER. Main catalyst for LULU is international growth and men's line. you can YOLO 150p too and hope bear market continues, but 180p seems more reasonable (and more expensive). enter on pump days, IMO. you're banking on meh guide, virus fear, China + East Asia slow down (S Korea and Japan).

---

**RH** - not the gay brokerage platform. Restoration Hardware is ""upscale"" furnishing for upper-middle-class. think 5k coffee table etc. I label them as upper-middle-class cuz the real $$$ stuff are names we haven't heard of or aren't really available the local upscale outdoor mall/shopping plaza.

drilled from 250 to current 126 (oof). I bought May 200p for $5, sold at $30s. It's fucking $75 ITM now. oops? its 52 weeks low was  $84 and this was during peak trade war, tariff issues.

a good % of tariff has still not been lifted but RH has said many times they've renegotiated pricing with vendors in China. they have an active buyback program (my guess they haven't really been buying). the stock has drilled non stop as the risk are high on production. while china seems to be getting the better of the virus, the country is still in the shitter for a good 2-3 months now.

bid/ask sucks balls on this but May 100p is going for around $7-8. if this recovers above $150-190 (it was at $190 just fucking last week), it's a good entry point imo for 150p again.

---

**DOCU** - bagheld this since IPO. made sick gains from calls and shares. dumped most of them at $72-$74 cuz i thought valuation was too high. imagine my pikachu face when this touched $90s earlier this year.

you would think an online based service would excel in a virus ridden world but the key thing is market perception of valuation. this is a pricey growth stock and it mooned from $40s to $60 last two ER ago. last ER showed OK growth and the stock continued to moon, but quite a bit of this was from free money bull market.

upcoming ER is later this week 3/12. 70p or 65p for April seems worth considering just for a pullback/guide down on growth. this captures an ER and one more month of bear market for a premium of $5 to $4"

There's a good chance tomorrow is a rebound day, depending on how the market likes Trump's speech tonight.  Unfortunately with a lack of tests **still** a problem in the US, it will soon be too late for contact-tracing and isolating individually exposed people (the Singapore / Korea strategy); leaving only mass shutdowns of all businesses (the Italy / Wuhan strategy) as a viable way of stopping the spread. With many cities not even shutting down schools, concerts etc, the political will to do that in the US will probably not be there until we get \~10X as many confirmed cases, which will likely happen next week.  The market still definitely hasn't priced in the impact of shutting down most businesses across the US for weeks.

I hope I'm wrong, and I wish I could do something more than yell on social media and profit off the downturn."
