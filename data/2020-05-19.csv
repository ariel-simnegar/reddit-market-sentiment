IRAs, 409Ks, pension funds, from decades of investing and contributions. the market has to trigger more fear before boomers start withdrawing their money from the market again."

**tldr: FB is acquiring PINS by weeks end** or a significant partnership.

1. FB says major marketplace announcement coming soon > 'Shops' announcement made with suprisingly little fanfare > FB hints at more to come so possibly incomplete action

2.  FB Shops needs a partner outside the usual FB sphere to turbocharge the launch and ~~force~~ introduce new independent users and sellers to platform. Probably a partner with high loyalty, high purchase rate, and above average incomes.

3. One platform checks almost all boxes: PINS has the loyalty, traffic, networks, and income to be a banner launch partner for Shops. An exclusivity deal would also push Shopify off a high value clientelle.

4. Insiders are already acting(Really the reason I dug down the rabbit hole) PINS has the highest 5/22 call volume by far for any stock besides SPY. The PCR is  0.03 - 3,000 to 88,000 - which is just stupid.

The real big marketplace announcement from FB is yet to come.

I have no idea how this affects MRNA's price because that has other factors like competition from other vaccine producers, etc., but this should have been bullish on outdoor stocks (because any vaccine news from any producer is bullish for them).

2020-05-20 04:11:18,rutkdn,-1,"If you have a bankroll of $50K+, you can easily bank several thousands each week playing directional SPY games.

Say SPY is at $293 today. We all know in this crazy market it's going to go below and above many times over between now, and say December.

Go to 12/18, pick a good strike above $300 with enough Open Interest and Volume. Anything. It doesn't fucking matter. Say you pick 500 contracts of 12/18 310/311 Call Credit spread @.43 each. Right now that would cost you $28k, max profit $21k. Doesn't matter, pick anything, any ratio works really. Then get 500 contracts with another strike just to spread them a bit.

With that spread, you have until December for SPY to dip below $293. But ain't nobody waiting to December. Few days later, SPY at $290 and you exit the positions with $3k profit. Then you assess, and jump back in. Bear, bull, doesn't matter, whatever the fuck you want. Play it safer and pick a further out DTE, go to fucking June 2021. This is free money. Worst case scenario it doesn't go your direction right away, so you fucking wait. The more days that pass, the more $$ you make on your correct directional move eventually. Free fucking money folks."

2020-05-20 02:08:20,isjusjwilegskamshso,7,"Prove me wrong - But I‚Äôm positive you can make money on any stock.

- Pick 5 - 10 stocks and track their volatility over a few weeks
- Within this timeframe the stocks will naturally go up and down between a given volatility
- From here you can see the dollar spread, high ends and low ends, and as the stock price moves you‚Äôll know if the stock is likely to bounce up or down depending on where it is
- example - within the past month Boeing has peaked 4 times with a 10-20 dollar spread between the highs and lows. Even if you don‚Äôt time the exact bottom or top, you can guess that it‚Äôs getting towards the higher or lower end and it‚Äôs bound to move 10-20$ in the other direction. As soon as it changes direction ride the wave for a day or 2 take profit and wait for the reversal"

They will push their stock price back up to the 70s easily with this rebuttal. The future of their company is on the line.

White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow (pictured) on Tuesday underscored the necessity for China to be held accountable for their actions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the country.

""Accountability is a key principle,"" Kudlow told Fox Business News, adding: ""China and the World Health Organization seem to us they were in collusion.""

He noted the letter sent by the US President Donald Trump to the WHO's director detailed the country's opinion about the Asian nation's alleged efforts to conceal details about the outbreak.

The economic advisor went on to say the US took ""strong action"" against Chinese companies considered national security threats, keeping them out of the retirement fund to ensure investor protection."

So GoToMeeting market cap of 4.4 billion x 4 would be 17.6 billion for Zoom. Divide their share price by 2 and that is where the share price should be. $90.

2020-05-19 22:45:38,LogicUpgrade,4,"So I barely slept last couple of days for unrelated reasons, and I was tired.

I entered bunch of leveraged shorts and I was deep in the red around noon. And price action has flatlined. I was sad, and sleepy, so I set some buy limits in the unlikely case something happens, I went for a nap.

At 3PM I wake up and I need to urgently take a dump. So as I'm laying a giant thick dump suddenly I hear from the home office all my price alarms go off and TWS starts announcing ""order filled... order filled... order filled..."". I was like WTF this is happening RIGHT NOW?

I go out, market has dumped on MRNA bad news and I'm solidly in the green and all my positions closed. 

TLDR; If you're in the red, take a dump."

2020-05-19 22:24:16,palopalopopa,2,"I'm still making $200-1500 every week selling a few retardedly OTM naked TSLA calls on pump days. Talking 1000c, 1100c, 1200c. Premiums were best prior to earnings, cleared over 1k a week consistently, but recently it's been closer to a few hundo a week. Still though, when will this free money train end? The delta/gamma on these are so low that even if TSLA jumped $120 overnight I still have time to get out without crushing losses.

Example of gains from better times:

Right now the only medicine I‚Äôm sensing might work is the antibody treatment (Covid-Shield) also known as SRNE, which no one seems to be talking about. In addition the antibody treatment news seems disappointing thus far. An 8-person study on the Moderna vaccine is meaningless when so many hurdles lie between that and eventually administering billions of doses to the general population. It‚Äôs like the difference between a baby taking his first steps and Usain Bolt running the 100m.

Another issue is vaccine safety. Medications that take years to develop and look great in phase 3 can turn out to be quite horrible once distributed. Take Fen-Phen and Vioxx for example. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of caution about administering a vaccine that only has months of safety data. I‚Äôm a proponent of vaccination. But I would be nervous about receiving something in December that was conceived in January. This is assuming a vaccine can even be made.

I don‚Äôt know much about how this virus will evolve either. I trust the experts who say it will persist. So I take the persistence of the virus, the lack of a clear treatment/vaccine potential, and most of all, our government‚Äôs poor response and reasons to be in cash for a while. The environment seems uncertain and dangerous for now."
