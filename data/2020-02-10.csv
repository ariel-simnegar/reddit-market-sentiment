There is NO reason why this market should keep going up with unemployment at such levels, fundamentals are currently fundamentally bad, etc👀. I just lost the rest of my life's savings buying my last puts that are down about -80% now😱. This bullrun should NEVER have continued past last week, it doesn't make ANY SENSE!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬

I know I made a mistake by over leveraging myself to the point where I am holding only puts in my portfolio 📉but playing the market taught me the markets are absolutely Irrational📈. Completely Irrational at times.🖨️🖨️

Needless to say I'm heart broken and going through 'some things' 🍆. I make a slightly above average salary, and I worked hard to save up and put time and effort into increasing that portfolio over the years. I'm at a point now where I don't know what to do. I'm in my 30's 👳‍♂️, and had been hoping to increase that portfolio a little more so I could buy a home and start a family with my wife👳‍♀️. I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me and I'm ashamed of my mistake and fighting feelings of hopelessness and depression. My wife is loving and supportive and isn't holding anything against me🧞‍♀️. She knows what happened was an unlikely outcome and was not intentional. She's starting to look for a job now after I told her we can't afford the vacation this Spring that I promised her. I just pray she doesn't get too desperate and find some lowly job that other women turn to...especially after how I found her... 🍆💩👳‍♀️🐐👳‍♂️

But tomorrow I'll sell my puts for a huge loss, buy SPCE V WMT MSFT TSLA calls and by the end of the week I will have my life savings back and a house for my family 👳‍♂️👳‍♀️🧕👲"

My bull then argued that you are only gay if you suck dicks, not if you get your dick sucked.
From that point we argued in circles, he got upset, and he slapped me in the face with his penis before locking me in my cuck shed.
Still, I feel as though I was in the right. I'm sure people here will agree with me that sucking dick is completely heterosexual if I was just prepping him. It's no different than heterosexually sucking a woman's penis."

2020-02-11 02:30:12,Zohboh,10,"How many of you guys taking part in the Paper Trading challenge? I did really well last year but I'm kinda nervous about doing it again.

I think if you go in with a really solid strategy and stick to it you got a good chance of winning, or at least hitting top 10. But sometimes its really hard to check your emotions at the door.  You know it's really important to set clear guidelines for your trades and stick to large cap tickers. But medium cap tickers can also be good.

However, if you want to mess with small cap and penny stocks you can still probably hit top 10. But I'd you do that it's really important to have a trading code and stick to it. If you can tackle those riskier bets while keeping your emotions in check it's really possible to make dreams come true.

But yeah I'm not sure if I'll compete this year. I'm really nervous about it.  I mean I did well last year, but I kept a journal with all my trading rules and made sure to read those every day.  And anytime I was getting stressed or felt unwell, I'd have a cup of chamomile tea and take a nap before I made any other plays. That way I could keep my emotions out of it."

2020-02-11 01:11:07,Voqals,2,"Here's an example of the type of play I have been considering.

&#x200B;

I have been looking at NIKE earnings and over their last 4 earnings calls the stock has made a move of about 7.5 points upward over the course of 4 weeks. 

&#x200B;

The next time NKE announces earnings will be March 19. 

&#x200B;

Some you may be thinking that the corona virus may affect nike earnings but many of their factories were not affected and are 500 miles away from WuHan. Additionally, Nike is well diversified and will be able to meet market demand, which has also been up recently due to increases in popularity of sports such as football and basketball, and continuous increases every year in the number membership holders across the US. I believe that after earnings announcement the stock will rise an average of 7.5 points +/- 2.5 points over the next month of trading. 

Currently looking at April 17 calls."

Here’s why : 

chegg has a large amount of short shares, a whopping 16.9 percent of shares are in a short position,  the stock is getting shorted ah because chegg soared 5 percent today and is near a 52 week high, chegg also has a relatively low float, 116 million, 

Now With more solid earnings posted today and a possibly a new reasonable dip to buy after a period of massive growth, The share price will settle and consolidate hopefully around these resistance levels 42- 44, and the dip will start getting bought, as does any dip in this market right now, 

As solid as cheggs report was today, I think it’s safe to predict a massive short squeeze might be coming. With the low float and large shares short percentage, with the stock down after solid earnings, fundamentally I could see a rally that spurs a massive short squeeze taking the stock to new highs in the near future."

Meanwhile, markets have *rightly* shrugged it off.

This is a disease that—I can’t emphasize enough—the CDC [edit to appease moron bears: NIH] says can be treated with “over the counter meds” and “using a home humidifier or taking a hot shower.”

Normally I'd be a little cautious since RSI is above 80 on higher timeframes (most notably the weekly at 87.7) showing it's very overbought. However, as TSLA has shown, we can run the engine at full rev with zero oil (aka stay above 90 and be SEVERELY overbought) for a bit. But once 191 is hit, I'm expecting people to start taking profits.

But even if we drop somewhat, we are in a beautiful upward channel, and surely would make a higher low before continuing upward."

2020-02-10 21:35:51,notmeididntsaythat,2,"ICE 21 Feb 97.5 and 100 calls are looking juicy. Already up >600% on mine at 92.50 and 95 strikes from two trading days ago. ICE was at 100 on Feb 3 and expected to snap back quickly.

From Barron's a few hours ago: ""ICE [quickly abandoned its plans following the brutal market reaction](https://www.barrons.com/articles/intercontinental-exchange-ebay-stock-wall-street-51581027155?mod=article_inline) to buy EBAY. “Don’t waste a good crisis,” Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note Friday. He also boosted his rating on ICE stock to Overweight and lifted the price target by $5 to $105.

With a deal between the two companies seemingly “nil,” Harris expects the hit to ICE’s valuation to be temporary. In the past, ICE shares have quickly rebounded from drawdowns, Harris said pointing to two prior dips in 2011 and 2016.""

 We've been at multi-century lows for interest rates for an ENTIRE business cycle. When those stopped pushing us higher, the Fed just pumped in new money in the form of QE/Repo, which will eventually come out in the form of inflation, and rob bond holders.

Not much to update today. Stonks go up. Resistance tomorrow at 336.1. Futures still have some room to run up before a pullback as well, so according to crayons we're still in decent shape to continue some upward movement tomorrow if JPow is dovish at his testimony and no Corona news comes out.

For those playing MSFT and got tendies today, crayons don't show resistance until 190.4ish early in the morning, and 191.5 by EOD. Support is 186.6. Current growth trend is also not outside of crayon zone, just a bit overvalued.

Speaking of overvalued, there was some articles circulating this weekend about impending recession or what have you. According to crayons we're about 10-11% overvalued and the VIX trend I've talked about in the last few crayon posts remains intact, with a pretty solid case to be made that a larger explosion upwards should occur before April. I'll post updates on those as I see them or as they occur.

That's all and I hope you all get more tendies tomorrow."

Today I bought and sold:

`2/14 $690c BUY / $700c SELL`

about 20 times. The price of that spread has a range of like $6 - $10. During the day I bought at $7.50 and sold at $8.50 / $9 a few times.

At worst, I don't see $TSLA dropping below $700 before expiration on Friday so if I have to let it ride (without a quick sale) I'm still looking at $250 per contract.

I made $5k today and currently have no liability in to the week. Let's go again tomorrow!"
