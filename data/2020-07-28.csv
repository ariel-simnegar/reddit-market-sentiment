Current markets are indicating a weaker USD, strong Gold & Silver and a strong stock market due to high inflation **expectations**.

Fed fund futures markets are speculating a cut in interest rate but this won't likely happen. Today is only important to understand Fed's position on inflation.

If Powell speculates deflationary in the short term, Gold and Silver will sell off, USD gains and a correction in stock market to Nancy's 300 floor.

If Powell speculates to set target on higher inflation (i.e 2% to 3%), Gold and Silver will rally hard, USD is gonna be in free fall and stock markets will rally.

My bet is on the first scenario. I also don't see yield curve control being implemented yet, as 10 year didn't collapse to 0 - something you would expect in a severe recession -."

He says ""I made $300 off the $100 I put in"". So I'm thinking to myself he must've bought options since webull doesn't do fractional shares. I'm like dude ""I think you bought an option by accident"" ""I don't know how you bought $100 worth of Tesla, but good job."" ""Send me screenshots""
That's when he sent me a screenshot of Nikola. I laughed my ass off that he was that retarded to think Nikola was Tesla. Then just now I realized that's the same Trevor Milton Nikola y'all are always talking about lol."

From my father, to my cousins, to people I call ""friends"", it just seems like I'm a punching bag for people. I hate that I got to live this life without my sister man all because of a drunk driver.

>Soon after, Quidsi noticed Amazon dropping prices up to 30 percent on diapers and other baby products. As an experiment, Quidsi executives manipulated their prices and then watched as Amazon’s website changed its prices accordingly. Amazon’s pricing bots — software that carefully monitors other companies’ prices and adjusts Amazon’s to match — were tracking Diapers.com.

>This began to worry investors, who became hesitant to put more money into Quidsi. And then Amazon ratcheted up the stakes by rolling out a new service called Amazon Mom that offered huge discounts and free shipping on diapers and other baby supplies. Quidsi executives calculated, according to Stone, that **“Amazon was on track to lose $100 million over three months in the diaper category alone.”** By November 2010, Quidsi’s board agreed to sell to Amazon. A few years later, the Amazon Mom program ended; a couple of years after that, the Diapers.com brand went away entirely.

Bullish scenario: 322 broke so I like 320.58-321.70 as solid support now. Look for 323.58+ to hold for new support. We tried today but volume was low overall all day. 

Bearish🩸: Look for the morning to break 321.70-320.58 down towards 318.95-317.65 and below. 315.50 is too strong. I would unload puts at that area. 

TLDR: Kang gang tomm between 318.95-323.58-324.93

I’m personally more bearish than bullish tomm. i will play with spy 0dte tomm. I will be looking to get calls/puts at those levels up there.

2020-07-29 02:25:15,newlife_newaccount,9,"How much can retail move a low volume low cap stock?

For instance, SCKT. Look out past June & July and the volume is in the hundreds or thousands on a good day. 

Then this youtube dude with a huge subscriber base and pay-to-play day trader platform ""announces"" he's seen a huge mover premarket. Signalling all his followers to buy in at open.

SCKT opens with volume of 180K in the first 5 minutes. And is up 265%. Volume of 954K within the first 30 minutes. On something that was lucky to get volume of 5K the past months.

It's almost as if the guy buys up shares slowly, and once he has a big enough position, sells a high volume of shares premarket, perhaps to other parties in on it, to make it look like a huge mover. Then he tells his followers to buy in, and sells off everything he's been buying for cheap to those same people he told to buy.

A good portion of his past positions I've looked at so far have been super low volume, super low market cap, and a pump and dump.

MTP, PRCP, AIHS, DPW, the list goes on. Look at the one month chart for them.

This is obviously wild speculation, but it seems pretty damn convenient he's able to perfectly ""time"" all these pump and dumps on tiny little shit companies over and over."

2020-07-29 01:54:01,piaskyj,1,Given contact rollover today I have a feeling silver trading is going to be less volatile until September futures expiry. I feel like the run up in price has been caused by a short squeeze from people worried about physical delivery of the silver. Then some big boys dumped last night because they didn’t have the silver to deliver but didn’t want to pay up for their short so they dumped to cover their losses (all speculation on my part but kind of makes sense. Now with the next contract expiry not until September I feel as if volatility will be low maybe some upward movement in the physical market pushing up the paper market as people who do have to deliver physical scramble for the product. But September could get real interesting with a short squeeze.

How do I proceed through earnings? Thinking to buy to close the call I sold near end of day tomorrow. As for the put, if AMZN reaches 2900 tomorrow, I'll sell the 2970 strike and buy one 7/31 2900p. 

I'm expecting a run up on thursday in anticipation of earnings, so I may be able to exit around 3100 or so depending on the size of the run up.

I *will* give advice because I also have 2 decades of capital loss carryover after burning through $100k NW in 2018. Don't be too ambitious. Even making $200 in an entire **month** is amazeballs if you average $2k/mo in expenditures. That shit right there, if you can keep it up, will compound over the years and make your life so much easier. Yes that's subtle and boring movement day to day and it's not gold painted lambos. But long enough periods of time you're literally shaving 3-10 years off your retirement date off an improved savings rate. 

**Yes**, I *know* you can do better than make $200 in a month, I only mean to stress that you respect risk and aim for consistency above all, which is to say, longevity -- always have some dry powder, waiting for sweeter opportunities, not getting bored and YOLO'ing more than you should.

Or you could say hey my Netflix (10) is free this month, my cellphone (30) is free, my food (300) is free, that $1250 I made today actually covers my rent. Be very patient and don't go all in 10 times in row!!

* The Fed will come out to announce that the economy is still fucked just like they did last time.

* A stimulus has to be passed that doesn't even have the party in power on board, much less the Democrats.

* Big tech (the only thing carrying the markets right now) has to not only get through an earnings season where they need to justify their 75% gains in the past 4 months, but also a huge antitrust hearing in front of the Democrats, who have not been shy in describing their displeasure with them and are increasingly likely to be the party in power come January.

It seems soooooooo fucking easy to play the next couple days. Which probably means I'm going to flame out spectacularly."

""Republicans revolt against GOP's initial stimulus plan.

Divisions within the Republican conference spilled out once again Tuesday as GOP senators dismissed key pieces of their own leadership's stimulus proposal not even a day after its release.

The revolt, which spans the ideological spectrum from conservatives to moderates in the conference, represents the latest challenge for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he seeks to salvage the GOP's opening bid and begin negotiations with Democrats to get a deal before the August recess."""

There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and those 2% savings accounts. 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz.

Sentiment was echoed here by everyone as well. I wavered selling all day 70c 7/31 thinking maybe there would be a final pump during power hour to get small profit or cut my loses. Ended up selling a few minutes before close at -50%  feeling good that I didn't bag hold, only to see minutes later, I would've been up if I had held. Just a little bummed that I've been off on all my predictions despite trying to study the current and historical trends"

Guys got some hot DD just out of the oven. For those who didn’t catch it this morning I did in fe the take a large shit and tear my asshole. Yes it was very bloody - heavy signal to a down day. As you all just witnessed at end of day, my asshole tells no tales. 

Now for the update. Yes, my asshole is still bleeding and smells kinda weird. However, upon wiping after another dogmatic shit the blood now has a slight hue of yellow and more translucent red than this morning. 

Bulls will say this is a strong end of day sentiment for a possible reversal tomorrow.

Bears will say this is an indicator of a second leg down tomorrow morning. Also, a few of you bears inquired about photographic proof of the DD. I apologize as I will not be sending any photographs of my ripped asshole. 

All, the morning dump DD or DDD should provide some more guidance on the direction of the day. I will be reporting my personal and intimate DDD approximately 45 minutes before opening bell.

Edit: I am sure all you Chimpu followers out there will enjoy my DD because like Chimpu It comes directly out of my ass."
