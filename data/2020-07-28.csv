Current markets are indicating a weaker USD, strong Gold & Silver and a strong stock market due to high inflation **expectations**.

Fed fund futures markets are speculating a cut in interest rate but this won't likely happen. Today is only important to understand Fed's position on inflation.

If Powell speculates deflationary in the short term, Gold and Silver will sell off, USD gains and a correction in stock market to Nancy's 300 floor.

If Powell speculates to set target on higher inflation (i.e 2% to 3%), Gold and Silver will rally hard, USD is gonna be in free fall and stock markets will rally.

My bet is on the first scenario. I also don't see yield curve control being implemented yet, as 10 year didn't collapse to 0 - something you would expect in a severe recession -."
