Current markets are indicating a weaker USD, strong Gold & Silver and a strong stock market due to high inflation **expectations**.

Fed fund futures markets are speculating a cut in interest rate but this won't likely happen. Today is only important to understand Fed's position on inflation.

If Powell speculates deflationary in the short term, Gold and Silver will sell off, USD gains and a correction in stock market to Nancy's 300 floor.

If Powell speculates to set target on higher inflation (i.e 2% to 3%), Gold and Silver will rally hard, USD is gonna be in free fall and stock markets will rally.

My bet is on the first scenario. I also don't see yield curve control being implemented yet, as 10 year didn't collapse to 0 - something you would expect in a severe recession -."

Always treat someone the way you want to be treated and I live by that code, but it's getting increasingly difficult. I was bullied growing up and even now, at 26, the amount of disrespect people throw at me for no reason is so eye opening. From my father, to my cousins, to people I call ""friends"", it just seems like I'm a punching bag for people. I hate that I got to live this life without my sister man all because of a drunk driver.

Amazon‚Äôs pricing bots ‚Äî software that carefully monitors other companies‚Äô prices and adjusts Amazon‚Äôs to match ‚Äî were tracking Diapers.com.

>This began to worry investors, who became hesitant to put more money into Quidsi. And then Amazon ratcheted up the stakes by rolling out a new service called Amazon Mom that offered huge discounts and free shipping on diapers and other baby supplies. Quidsi executives calculated, according to Stone, that **‚ÄúAmazon was on track to lose $100 million over three months in the diaper category alone.‚Äù** By November 2010, Quidsi‚Äôs board agreed to sell to Amazon. A few years later, the Amazon Mom program ended; a couple of years after that, the Diapers.com brand went away entirely.

Bullish scenario: 322 broke so I like 320.58-321.70 as solid support now. Look for 323.58+ to hold for new support. We tried today but volume was low overall all day. 

Bearishü©∏: Look for the morning to break 321.70-320.58 down towards 318.95-317.65 and below. 315.50 is too strong. I would unload puts at that area. 

TLDR: Kang gang tomm between 318.95-323.58-324.93

I‚Äôm personally more bearish than bullish tomm. i will play with spy 0dte tomm. I will be looking to get calls/puts at those levels up there.

2020-07-29 02:25:15,newlife_newaccount,9,"How much can retail move a low volume low cap stock?

For instance, SCKT. Look out past June & July and the volume is in the hundreds or thousands on a good day. 

Then this youtube dude with a huge subscriber base and pay-to-play day trader platform ""announces"" he's seen a huge mover premarket. Signalling all his followers to buy in at open.

SCKT opens with volume of 180K in the first 5 minutes. And is up 265%. Volume of 954K within the first 30 minutes. On something that was lucky to get volume of 5K the past months.

It's almost as if the guy buys up shares slowly, and once he has a big enough position, sells a high volume of shares premarket, perhaps to other parties in on it, to make it look like a huge mover. Then he tells his followers to buy in, and sells off everything he's been buying for cheap to those same people he told to buy.

A good portion of his past positions I've looked at so far have been super low volume, super low market cap, and a pump and dump.

MTP, PRCP, AIHS, DPW, the list goes on. Look at the one month chart for them.

This is obviously wild speculation, but it seems pretty damn convenient he's able to perfectly ""time"" all these pump and dumps on tiny little shit companies over and over."

2020-07-29 01:54:01,piaskyj,1,Given contact rollover today I have a feeling silver trading is going to be less volatile until September futures expiry. I feel like the run up in price has been caused by a short squeeze from people worried about physical delivery of the silver. Then some big boys dumped last night because they didn‚Äôt have the silver to deliver but didn‚Äôt want to pay up for their short so they dumped to cover their losses (all speculation on my part but kind of makes sense. Now with the next contract expiry not until September I feel as if volatility will be low maybe some upward movement in the physical market pushing up the paper market as people who do have to deliver physical scramble for the product. But September could get real interesting with a short squeeze.

How do I proceed through earnings? Thinking to buy to close the call I sold near end of day tomorrow. As for the put, if AMZN reaches 2900 tomorrow, I'll sell the 2970 strike and buy one 7/31 2900p. 

I'm expecting a run up on thursday in anticipation of earnings, so I may be able to exit around 3100 or so depending on the size of the run up.

I *will* give advice because I also have 2 decades of capital loss carryover after burning through $100k NW in 2018. Don't be too ambitious. Even making $200 in an entire **month** is amazeballs if you average $2k/mo in expenditures. That shit right there, if you can keep it up, will compound over the years and make your life so much easier. Yes that's subtle and boring movement day to day and it's not gold painted lambos. But long enough periods of time you're literally shaving 3-10 years off your retirement date off an improved savings rate. 

**Yes**, I *know* you can do better than make $200 in a month, I only mean to stress that you respect risk and aim for consistency above all, which is to say, longevity -- always have some dry powder, waiting for sweeter opportunities, not getting bored and YOLO'ing more than you should.

Or you could say hey my Netflix (10) is free this month, my cellphone (30) is free, my food (300) is free, that $1250 I made today actually covers my rent. Be very patient and don't go all in 10 times in row!! 

7 times in a row is okay though, just up to your personal risk tolerance. :)"

* A stimulus has to be passed that doesn't even have the party in power on board, much less the Democrats.

* Big tech (the only thing carrying the markets right now) has to not only get through an earnings season where they need to justify their 75% gains in the past 4 months, but also a huge antitrust hearing in front of the Democrats, who have not been shy in describing their displeasure with them and are increasingly likely to be the party in power come January.

There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and those 2% savings accounts. 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz. Go for the millions. But please do not let this extensive clarification distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer‚Äôs table.

Now for the update. Yes, my asshole is still bleeding and smells kinda weird. However, upon wiping after another dogmatic shit the blood now has a slight hue of yellow and more translucent red than this morning. 

Bulls will say this is a strong end of day sentiment for a possible reversal tomorrow.

Bears will say this is an indicator of a second leg down tomorrow morning. Also, a few of you bears inquired about photographic proof of the DD. I apologize as I will not be sending any photographs of my ripped asshole. 

All, the morning dump DD or DDD should provide some more guidance on the direction of the day. I will be reporting my personal and intimate DDD approximately 45 minutes before opening bell.

Edit: I am sure all you Chimpu followers out there will enjoy my DD because like Chimpu It comes directly out of my ass."
