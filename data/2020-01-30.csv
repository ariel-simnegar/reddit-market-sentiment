So... with Winnie the Flu still going on, gynese markets opening on monday and Iowa this weekend... What are your thoughts on playing a straddle on spy?

I think the chances of SPY staying flat are rather slim...

Worst case: Flu get's worse. Bernie wins and Chinese cash out on monday -> big gap down

Best case: Flu resolved, bernie tanks, chinese put money from their market in us-assets -> big gap up
