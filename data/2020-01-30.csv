So... with Winnie the Flu still going on, gynese markets opening on monday and Iowa this weekend... What are your thoughts on playing a straddle on spy?

I think the chances of SPY staying flat are rather slim...

Best case: Flu resolved, bernie tanks, chinese put money from their market in us-assets -> big gap up

This past month was red for me, and I'll have to change things to turn this shit around by the end of the year. Basically I really have to stop selling those mother fucking naked calls even though they're so tempting. It was literally a New Year's resolution for me to stop doing that, but I still did so and paid the consequences. I should probably stay away from earnings too. Since selling calls keeps fucking me up, maybe I'll start buying some calls every once in awhile instead.

If February is a repeat of January or worse, I will most likely have to take a month or two off from trading. Good thing I'll have this weekend to relax my mind."

2020-01-31 07:04:47,chaney3,6,"* Historically speaking it seems that mean reversion tactics have proved less and less effective as algos become more and more advanced and developed to anticipate these moves.
   * Makes sense. I know this already. Everybody in fact knows about mean reversion.
* Generally there is a constant growth rate to any equity price that can be subject to change, but at a lesser intensity than other facts
   * Also makes sense, pretty much everyone knows this too. This is like the purpose of a 200 period MA. I also have seen this modeled quite in depth with geometric Brownian motion models with a drift constant. Say for example, you drop a piece of sand into water, the movement of the sand *is* random too an extent, but ultimately follows a constant path along its way.
* A delay in the bifurcation process is generally preceded by a period of decreased stability.
   * Again, nothing new here. This is just saying that before a stock price moves, it consolidates.
* Transitions towards the tail ends of periods of instability are generally followed by periods of new equilibrium
   * Okai, still nothing new, this is just saying that stocks will move after they are finished with their consolidation periods.
* ""Two patterns of nonlinear transitions are outlined: a slow and fast transition. The slow transition is possible when a parameter change is slower than a system relaxation. A gradual shift of a control parameter is followed by a delay before a disruption of a reversion. A fast transition arises through the singular fusion of unstable and stable equilibriums. It is shown that such transition is preceded by passing through the area of the extremely small fluctuations.""
   * Okai, so this is what I have learned tonight. This right here. This is saying that given two different instances.
      * 1 where the ""parameter change"", or in other words the Moving average, is slower than stabilization of the price (ie, more trendiness and less consolidation) in this 1st case scenario, the prices are going to follow a delay in price action before its mean reversion (and generally with a fat tail, ie, the reversion will be skewed with trades at common prices more and more common than trades at prices at a different price point.) This also states that the breakout will be less likely to be extreme. More of a slow grind in whichever direction it chooses next.
      * 2- this one is saying that if price action is still trending relatively close to the pre existing MA during periods of consolidation, then the price movement is much more likely to be more intense/extreme. This one is the opposite of 1. It is saying that the price action is more likely to be fast and extreme.

TL;DR: If your consolidation period is close to your moving average, you are more likely to get a huge price movement off of the breakout period. But if your consolidation period is not as close to the moving average, the price changes will be more of a slow grind. Note that this has very little to do with the direction the price moves, simply the speed of the price changes.  


I am not sure how well this holds up in real practice but will be doing some tinkering and back-testing."

AWS 4th quarter revenue was 9.95b

AMD 4th quarter revenue was 2.13b and whole 2019 revenue of only 6.73b

Just 1 quarter from AWS brought in more revenue than AMD did for the whole year. 

AWS only makes up 11% of Amazon's total revenue, but accounted for 67% of their total operating income in 4q, meaning they are running on insane margins comparative to the rest of their company."

$QQQ 232c 2/14

&#x200B;

With the Nasdaq showing good signs at the end of the day and as we go green into our futures day I think $QQQ will have some healthy upward momentum going into the day tomorrow. with a Delta of .0717 and a price of .15 you are looking at almost 50% gains per dollar rise in $QQQ minus that toll we all pay, Theta. While on that topic the Theta of this option is fairly low though, as with all OTM options, a little Theta goes a long way. If the NASDAQ manages to break through its intraday ATH of 9,439 or it closes above its ATH of 9,402.48 then it's momentum will carry $QQQ, and the value of this OTM call, to great heights as we strive for that beautiful 10K milestone."

Trying to understand it. So let's say there's V for 3/20. Strike price is $215, Bid/ask is $3.50-3.65.

So if I bought ten of those, I'll be spending $35-36 real money, with an option to buy 10 V at $215 before 3/20? What happens if it goes higher than $215?

If it goes to 215 from the 201 after hour it is now, I'd make $14\*10? ($140) ?"

I'm sure we would all love Marty McFly's 1985 sports almanac, but dwelling on mistakes you've made without an aim to analyze and correct them does you no good, and you can bet your ass that the masters of the universe that own these companies we all gamble on sure don't do it. Not to mention, not making a trade that *could* have resulted in a lot of financial gain is not a mistake. 

There will always be another trade. Remember that the end goal of this is to actually have money to enjoy your life, not the dopamine thrill that comes with seeing numbers tick up on a screen. They can go the other way just as fast.

2020-01-30 22:31:45,knotswag,26,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

[As I said yesterday night,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evt97l/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_30/ffz476g/) we are likely in the beginnings of a longer-term correction. The crayons have not been disrupted enough for me to change my mind on the matter quite yet, and if we have confirmations tomorrow and Monday then I'll be convinced that things will be short-term bearish. 

What would confirm the thinking? Two aspects of the current crayon setups should occur. We need to watch the dual VIX and SPY. [SPY just tested downward resistance today for the fourth time since Jan 22](https://imgur.com/Di6nCuL) and [VIX is about to re-test a support.](https://imgur.com/mvDrqSq) If VIX breaks below this support and SPY jumps above this downward resistance tomorrow, I think we'll start to turn back upwards. If not, I think today is just a day that confirms crayon behavior.

What I'm currently doing is watching /NQ futures. Right before the break, we broke above the recent ""lower"" price channel we've been in [with a giant green dick candle,](https://imgur.com/jkggFmQ) suggesting that that the correction thesis may be wrong if we keep veering up. So if NQ behavior holds throughout the night without re-entering the lower green crayon channel, combined with the two things I listed above, I think we'll break past the correction assumptions and be back on the path to bullishness. That would have to be confirmed on Monday when China's market finally opens, and if it does, then I would resume buying heavily. If not, as I mentioned in yesterday's post, I don't think any upcoming correction will be extremely bad, especially with repo.

See you guys tomorrow and let's get tendies. None with Corona on them, though. I don't like those kinds of tendies."

Dumb question time: on RH how do you calculate the entry cost of options (to deduct) when you close positions on spreads? For example:

+ Buy-to-open 100 call 2/28 exp for $10 premium (Debit)

+ Sell-to-open 100 call 2/14 exp for $8 premium (Credit)

+ Total cost of spread = $2 debit

Then when you close it out

+ Sell-to-close 100 call 2/28 exp for updated amount of $30 (credit)

+ Buy-to-close 100 call 2/14 exp for updated amount of $25 (debit)

+ Total cost to close contracts = $5 credit

Is my final cost $5 or $3 ($5 exit cost minus $2 entry cost)? RH only shows me the exit cost of $5?"

+ Sell-to-open 100 call 2/14 exp for $8 premium (Credit)

Total cost of spread = $2 debit
