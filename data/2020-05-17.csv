We have a family friend that owns a business. Last night they were open late for business when a rage induced individual comes into their business looking for his girlfriend and proceeds to shoot everyone on sight. The entire family was present. The dad. The mom. The son. The son ended up passing away from the gunshot. He was around my age (28), and all he was doing was dropping off medication for his father because his dad left it at their house. He was just there at the wrong time. I didn't know the family well, but I knew them. They were good people and were kind. And now that family will have a black hole forever. I feel so fucking torn up man. It's been eating at me all day.

SPY calls. Unlimited ammunition. Jpow gonna pump futures 1% every night this week. Position accordingly.

Thursday, is obviously the wild card as you have initial jobless claims, leading economic indicators, and existing home sales all reporting, and there‚Äôs nothing scheduled for Friday. I think you can be bullish up until close of the bell on Wednesday, go cash, and jump back in on the bullish or bearish side after 10am EST on Thursday depending on how the market reacts to the data being released. Friday we‚Äôll probably see a boring, low volume day going into a 3 day weekend baring some huge news event. It‚Äôll probably end up being a doji on the daily candle with the week over all up.

Viruses mutate, they evolve because they are living things that seek to reproduce. To do that they need to get in our cells and so they will evolve to be more infectious; it‚Äôs not a bearish thing to say it‚Äôs basic biology. This is a new disease for humanity like small pox was for the native Americans. Will we be immune to it, yes in time. But seven billion people getting it is going to take awhile. Even Spain only had 5% of their total pop getting infected and world wide 4 million is t that high a number. Eventually the virus will mutate/evolve to be more infectious and more people will get sick easier. And because human society is not one to admit it will sacrifice millions for money we will see lock downs again; not because we care but because for appearance/ the rich and powerful and afraid to get sick so let the poor suffer so we don‚Äôt get sick,  it lockdowns will happen again because we can‚Äôt accept that people will die from this. This rally also is only because the fed and congress can pass free money to the market that frankly is probably using money it doesn‚Äôt have already. 


Ride the rally while you can? But near or bull do not assume this will last. This is a new disease which we know nothing about, hell look at what it is doing to children when we assumed kids were safe. They are suffering syndromes of inflammation that are killing them. Hell im 27 and people my age are having strokes from this disease. I started from the beginning and assumed this was the equivalent of the Black Death and too all procautions to keep myself safe from infection as I could. 

We are Barry half a year into this first wave, and look at the economic impact. If science is true, and let‚Äôs be fucking honest science is always true in the long term, the virus is increasing its infectious ness,  by late summmer or early fall the second wave will be worse than the first. Th first wave brought our economy to a halt and the do and spy to almost 200. If the second wave is worse; and it will be worse by basic evolution, we should expect to see a new low or the same low near the end of year; even if you count a sharp return by December. 

And let‚Äôs opt forget China is considering military action in order to scare the west of their China blame. It‚Äôs in articles in the news. But
If you think or say fake news this is still something to consider. If you were a nation getting all the heat for a virus would you not consider military action against a lesser nation. In order to drive ww3 fears in other world powers so they leave you alone?

The world market and politics is far greater than any of us online thinks we k ow it alls can imagine.  We could be on the doorstep of a nuclear war each day. Assume the worst and prepare for the beast; or vice Versa but be prepared for any possible scenario. This is unknown territory and anything could happen. Humans always prepare after the doomsday has happened. Remember that. And please for the love of god; be safe. I don‚Äôt want anyone here getting sick. Be safe and be healthy."

""On April 3, 2000, judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his conclusions of law in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001) and ruled that Microsoft was guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This led to a one-day 15% decline in the value of shares in Microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the value of the Nasdaq. Many people saw the legal actions as bad for technology in general.[32] That same day, Bloomberg News published a widely read article that stated: ""It's time, at last, to pay attention to the numbers"".[33]"""

Prior to starting our illustrious college careers to becoming functioning members of society, it was Senior Beach Week at Cherry Grove. 

I was sitting on a bed, there was another one parallel to the bed I was on, 3 people on each bed waiting to hit the bowl for a total of 6 people in the room. 

The bowl arrives to me so I hit it and as soon as I do I start rocking back and forth uncontrollably. 

I legit thought I was a box of cereal, rocking, and falling over in the shopping cart; I couldn't sit still or sit up only teeter.

Visually everyone still looked like people but my brain was registering them as other groceries in the cart. 

As people left the room, my brain was telling me they were being rung up.

If you know the pattern I‚Äôm referring to then you know, if you don‚Äôt then just look back at the past month or two. now more than ever we must inverse the inverse of what we think Mm is going to do and actually play into what they have been doing this whole time.
Bull runs up to 290+, then sudden drop (one that drops harder and harder every week), and don‚Äôt forget every Friday closing right in the middle to fuck over bears and bulls equally like we saw last Friday at a crisp 285. 

The pattern will not change! EVEN if we‚Äôve caught onto it, they know that we‚Äôll mentally fuck our selves trying to stay ahead and switch our plays. But do the opposite and stay as you are. It works until it doesn‚Äôt üòà"

**Literally what I said two days ago:**

WSB sentiment is bearish and predicts a rug pull Monday.

Statistically, based on stats run in the sub data, only 30% of the moves and comments have been correct or profitable in this sub. 70% have lost or were wrong.

Basically, it's not even a meme. INVERSE WSB.

Therefore, green Monday confirmed. Stimulus and NYSE floor reopening being priced in. New rally incoming. I'm telling you guys this right now before it happens. 

Please don't make the wrong moves. I'm 100% sure we're going to tank in these coming months (as a bear), but now is not the time. Don't make an emotional monday circuit-breaker play, because Monday isn't it. Be a short-term bull, and a long-term bear. You don't have to be perma one gang or the other. Just be rational."

If you own puts, you're basically betting entirely on a big second wave that causes some cities/states to shutdown again.

For that to happen, we'd probably need to see 3000 deaths a day at some point by end of June.

Yes, we're likely opening prematurely in a lot of areas, but to go from where we are to back up to 3000 deaths a day is not the base case in my mind.  It seems more likely that we just muddle through and maybe have a plateau around 500-1000 deaths per day for a while."

Powell sees unemployment rate getting as high as 25%, while economy could contract by 30% or more in April-June quarter

The chairman of the Federal Reserve on Sunday said the central bank has not exhausted its power to help the economy get through the coronavirus pandemic.

""We're not out of ammunition by a long shot,"" Powell said in a transcript of his interview aired on the CBS news magazine ""60 Minutes."" (https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/)

The Fed chairman said there was ""no limit"" to what the Fed can do to lend money to financial markets.

""So there's a lot more we can do to support the economy, and we're committed to doing everything we can as long as we need to,"" Powell said.

Earlier Sunday, Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, the corporate parent of Pimco, said he was concerned that investors were counting too much on Fed support to get the economy through the crisis.

Read: Road ahead likely to be bumpy, El-Erian says (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/buckle-your-seat-belts-the-road-ahead-is-going-to-be-bumpy-warns-el-erian-2020-05-17)

Powell said the Fed could enlarge existing lending programs or start new ones. The central bank's balance sheet is already approaching $7 trillion (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-balance-sheet-nears-7-trillion-mark-2020-05-14).

The central bank could try to lower interest rates to make commitments about the future path of policy, a strategy called ""forward guidance,"" or could also ""change our asset-purchase strategy,"" Powell said. That's a reference to the hundreds of billions of dollars of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has been buying.

He repeated that Congress is likely to need to spend more money to keep businesses and households from becoming insolvent.

Powell said now is not the time to worry about the long-term consequences of this debt spree.

""It is true that deficits are going to be big for a couple of years here. And we'll have to deal with that. The time to deal with that, though, is when we're through this recovery,"" he said.

The consequence of stopping spending now risks ""longer-run damage to the productive capacity of the economy and to people's lives,"" he said.

Powell's biggest concern seemed to be a potential ""second wave"" of the coronavirus. Health experts are divided over the risks of a spike in cases later this year. The Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 had three waves.

""It's very important to avoid that, very important,"" Powell said. Such a development would cause another downturn and be bad for confidence, he said.

He acknowledged that the statistics about the spread of the coronavirus are almost more important that the economic data that the central bank routinely monitors.

""The thing that matters more than anything else is the medical metrics,"" he said.

See: Economy cannot recover until it hits rock bottom (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-economy-can-only-start-to-recover-from-its-coronavirus-meltdown-once-it-hits-rock-bottom-are-we-there-yet-2020-05-16)

The April-June gross domestic product report ""will be very, very bad,"" with an annualized growth decline that could easily be ""in the twenties or thirties,"" he said.

There will likely be ""a couple more months of net job losses"" before the unemployment rate peaks in a range of 20%-25%, he said.

The Fed chairman waved away comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s. ""It should be a much shorter downturn than we would associate with the 1930s,"" he said. The Great Depression lasted for 10 years.

Powell said he thinks the economy will start to recover in the July-September quarter, but it will ""take some time to pick up steam.""

Read: Powell says there's growing sense the recovery will be slow (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-fiscal-spending-may-be-worth-it-as-the-recovery-will-take-time-to-gain-strength-feds-powell-says-2020-05-13)

""The main thing is to get back on the road to recovery. And I think that can happen relatively soon,"" he said.

While the economy won't get back to where it was in December 2019 by the end of this year, he said once the economy is on the road to recovery, the Fed will try to keep it on the road for a long period of time.

In a clip released earlier by CBS, Powell said he would not bet against the American economy (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-chairman-powell-tells-60-minutes-a-recovery-will-take-awhile-but-dont-bet-against-the-american-economy-2020-05-17).

Asked when he realized how serious the pandemic was, Powell said it didn't come suddenly, like a light switch. ""We saw it coming,"" he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 27% from its closing low on March 23, but still down 17% year to date."
2020-05-17 23:40:38,misterjefe83,2,"u know people all like bailouts help the taxpayer, but how the fuck is that not just getting a slap on the wrist and incentivizing it more.

it's like ur making mad bank just working your regular job, then u think hey i can make like way more money running cons and in jeopardy of bankrupting yourself.  then u get caught and instead of fucking throwing u in jail, they go...well...okay, actually we'll keep u from going bankrupt.. actually, let's give u some money too.  just do what u did originally and pay us back w/ interest.  so u go back to ur job no probs and make money the ""legit"" way and pay mr gov't back.  the lesson u learned is to be a bit less reckless next time.

that's basically wtf is going on lol.  don't fucking tell me just b/c we get our money paid back all is well."

Truthfully. Us in our 20s/30s will be making up for the mistakes of these idiots in ten years while they sit in their nursing homes getting their asses wiped with intact 401k's while we live with mom. 

it's a bitter fucking perspective but as a doctor with friends who have 250k in debt who were told it was ""the price they pay for their future"" (meanwhile boomer docs paid off their tuition while in school and made 2x when accounting for inflation, introduced midlevels to earn them more money while fucking us over in the process, and are now retiring as docs take pay cuts) it's just one example of how boomers had everything lined up for them to set the world up and fucked the future for their kids. 

I probably come across as a ""spoiled doctor"" but as someone who is 28 years old and not set to start earning 6 figures until 32, with no real savings, working 60 - 80 hours a week, and having spent my 20s studying 10x more material than these stupid doctors did 40 years ago, im bitter af lol. 

btw - go see a younger doctor. they likely know more, are up to date on current guidelines, and aren't as reliant on their own bias.  The ""older doctor knows more"" meme only applies to like an ICU. Even surgery is progressing so fast that I have literally watched 50 year old surgeons struggle to keep up with modern less invasive technology"

The market does not ""sell off"" for no reason. 

The previous drop was caused by Lindsey Graham introducing the Accountability Act. Nothing has materially changed.

There is nothing Jpow going to say on 60 minutes that wasn't included in the fed stability report. Read that if you want real DD.

The market is up because institional investors currently deem the risks acceptable to the returns they must achieve. And will continue to trickle up until that is no longer the case."

* 20 contracts with $60c

The money tomorrow is going into $55c. Want to play RTX long term without worrying about theta for now, and want to magnify gains instead of using shares. It's not 'if' it's 'when' RTX will pop off. Also want the lower strike prices here too give me some leeway and bring my average strike needed down. Plays delta better too

Goldman's is dead. It can't make heads and tails in this market and no one is trusting them anymore. Even warren buffet dropped them (https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/05/16/buffett-sells-stocks-goldman-sachs-no-elephant-sized-acquisition/#60b9a244bbf9)

Why would he do that?

He would because Goldman has rode FOMO and are not worth gold, man. Goldman has underpeformed over the years and will continue to do so in a downturn upcoming. Remember, this is a bear market and think of how Goldman did last time.

Not only that, right before close, there was a bunch of put buying before Warren's 13F came out.

We know the smart money is pulling this down. Are we smart or dumb?
