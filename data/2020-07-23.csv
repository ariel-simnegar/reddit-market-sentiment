2020-07-24 09:37:27,RayCashIsTrashDalio,2,"might be time to buy TSLA puts soon üòé 

When you ask TSLA bulls on WSB why they think TSLA is gunna go up, 99% of them say ""bro dont u know TSLA is gunna get added to the sp500?""

like that is literally the only reason people are buying TSLA right now. a lot of the hype is mostly over now that TSLA has had its earnings and dumped afterwards. most of the TSLA price action these past months are due to 1. short covering, 2. dOnT u kNoW TsLa iS gUnNa gEt aDdeD to tHe Sp500?, 3. elon musky tweets, 4. hype/momentum from retail.  1) shorts dont need to cover if its going down, 2) everyone fucking knows TSLA is probably getting added to the sp500 u fuck 3) i dont think musk has anymore twitter ammo left after deliveries, short shorts, and earnings have all passed. if anything he will most likely have a twitter meltdown to either try and dump the price so that he can buy more shares back, or just have a plain meltdown and dump the stock price anyway 4) after earnings, i think a lot of the hype/momentum upward has died down. everyone was looking forward to tesla earnings, its like the superbowl of the stock market this past year. now that its over, no one really wants to talk about it anymore. tsla 1300p 7/31
