When you ask TSLA bulls on WSB why they think TSLA is gunna go up, 99% of them say ""bro dont u know TSLA is gunna get added to the sp500?""

like that is literally the only reason people are buying TSLA right now. a lot of the hype is mostly over now that TSLA has had its earnings and dumped afterwards. most of the TSLA price action these past months are due to 1. short covering, 2. dOnT u kNoW TsLa iS gUnNa gEt aDdeD to tHe Sp500?, 3. elon musky tweets, 4. hype/momentum from retail.  1) shorts dont need to cover if its going down, 2) everyone fucking knows TSLA is probably getting added to the sp500 u fuck 3) i dont think musk has anymore twitter ammo left after deliveries, short shorts, and earnings have all passed. if anything he will most likely have a twitter meltdown to either try and dump the price so that he can buy more shares back, or just have a plain meltdown and dump the stock price anyway 4) after earnings, i think a lot of the hype/momentum upward has died down. everyone was looking forward to tesla earnings, its like the superbowl of the stock market this past year. now that its over, no one really wants to talk about it anymore. tsla 1300p 7/31

2020-07-24 07:57:37,LehmanParty,11,"1.06^12 is about 2. In other words playing theta gang and selling puts that net 6% premium per month on average would yield 100% profit every year if you let it stack up (Optimally; obviously it would be far from ideal, even when diversified). Doing that with $50,000 would produce $50,000 (before taxes). Additional capital put into the system would reduce risk and further ensure the end result of the same output. After a while I'll bump it up to $75,000. That's my endgame boys. Everyone has an endgame. Mine will be a modest life escaping the indentured servitude that is the 40 hour work week and doing whatever my hobbies will be once I get there. Maybe I'll invent something that makes the world a better place. Maybe I'll make some cool music. Maybe I'll do the 2025 version of playing Diablo 3 all day. Won't know until I'm free to find out."

The Food and Drug Administration has expanded the list of hand sanitizers ‚Äî some sold at Walmart, Costco and other national chains ‚Äî being recalled to at least 75 recently, saying toxic levels of wood alcohol in them can cause injury or death.

The FDA said that there has been an increase in hand sanitizers that are labeled to contain ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, but have tested positive for methanol, or wood alcohol. If methanol is absorbed through the skin, it can cause blindness and hospitalizations, or death if ingested."

Youre watching the dollar lose value in real time as these stock values keep skyrocketing. Stocks will continue to appear to go up because of this with the occasional pullbacks like today and possible black swan events. Its going to get reflected in retail goods as well but that might be more gradual and less noticeable. There may be a tech bubble mixed in too but its hard to differentiate that from the inflation."

If you want to look at their financial statement I'd recommend you look at their 10-Q and call. They have a very small business model. The business model is so small that they're not going to change anytime soon. They've been selling a 10%/year growth rate for the past 11 years. They're currently at a 2.5% growth rate. I think they'll be able to beat that growth rate for the foreseeable future but it's going to take them at least 5 years to get there. I think it's worth the risk."

If we don‚Äôt raise rates, we‚Äôre looking at gnarly inflation.  If we do, we‚Äôre gutting the housing and stock markets.

The downside of cash is obvious, I think it‚Äôs that fear that‚Äôs keeping the market up.  If the market crashes we‚Äôll be looking at real wealth destruction. 

Where are you going to store your money?  What assets are trustworthy?  It‚Äôs fucking tech stocks for now man.  Valuations don‚Äôt matter, PE doesn‚Äôt matter.  We‚Äôre going to have to come up with a novel way to solve this.

I was doing computer science but found it so fucking painful to work on that I couldn‚Äôt do the upper year courses and am going for the general degree. I have 4 courses left that I‚Äôm taking right now at a different university and I don‚Äôt even want to finish them. What the fuck is the point if that degree isn‚Äôt going to do a thing for me? 

I‚Äôve been looking to go into carpentry as I used to do that kind of work back in high school but doing an apprenticeship for 5 years doesn‚Äôt appeal to me. I need to do something now. 

I‚Äôve got some business ideas I‚Äôve wanted to work towards:

1. Virtual Reality Driving School

Driving school is done by every teenager and they all sit in some boring ass class watching car crash videos all day. They pay good money for this stuff, and by making it an environment that‚Äôs enjoyable will attract the male teenager getting his learners permit very well.

2. Local Video call math Tutoring service 

Parents will pay anything in hopes that their kid gets good marks to get accepted into university, with COVID, you can make the excuse to not go to their individual homes as that is the most annoying and time consuming aspect of in person tutoring. My sister is a math teacher and says she would do this in a heart beat.

3. Becoming a tech installation technician

When a new home is built it needs Ethernet run, alarm system set up, security cameras, smoke alarms, in house speaker systems etc. Getting contracts with contractors with this type of work would be good money.

Also if MSFT doesn‚Äôt reach 220 by Aug 21 i will be completely broke.

Appreciate any advice if you scroll past this please give your $0.02."

2020-07-23 23:42:34,bobstaman,14,"You want to know what this is all going to come down to?  
Remember that we're supposed to get a cost of living increase every year to combat inflating prices?  
&nbsp;  
Imagine the inflation being much higher than the ~2% projected for the past 20 years but not getting the wage increase to battle it.  
For that long, the fed has been manipulating the data to make inflation look normal which has caused assets to increase in value.  All the while consumers are spending more and more on things like houses, cars, food... everything, and their wages don't adjust to keep up with the increase in prices. Only reducing other forms of consumption and/or going into debt.  
&nbsp;  
Mortgages loans, auto loans, credit debt, student debt. They're all things that cause inflation, using debt now to stimulate growth that compensates for the debt and then some, later on. We are now at a point where all this debt that's been accumulated isn't going to be spurring growth and the longer it goes on the worse it will be. It'll naturally cause deflationary pressures by consumers deleveraging the debt and reducing other expenditures. Without the jobs/stimulus/UE+/economy, this will continue to worsen. We tried our best to bridge the gap with brrrrr and the stimulus packs but at this point it's only going to slow down the progression of the deleveraging.  
&nbsp;  
With all that has happened, it's forced the consumer into a position of needing to reduce the debt burden. Whether it's because they've accrued too much/not in a position to comfortably satisfy it/the future is uncertain, the process of paying down debt is already in motion. We can pump tons and tons of money into the consumers but until the underlying issues are resolved, deleveraging will be what happens with those funds.  
&nbsp;  
We're in a weird spot to where if we print out trillions and give it to consumers then all it'll go to is debt/necessities/savings until the economy and the issues around it are resolved. And on top of that comes the deleveraging of the fed/government debt which is inevitable. The USD will dictate that quicker than we can.  
&nbsp;  
Sorry. Wall of text. If you don't wanna read it then whatever. I just needed to think it out.

I'm spreading them, with 8/21, 9/18, 10/16, and 1/15/21s.

The company and stock has constantly declined the past 5 years (see the charts). The majority of the past 3 months has floated between $7.5 - $10.00 (although it has gone over like it is now). Q1 earnings were trash. Q2 earning (July 31) will be no better. College sports are a question mark this upcoming season. Pro sports as well.

I think they're poised to come back down to $8.50 as a stock price soon... and could be even lower when the general stock bubble pops.

\*\*\*Full disclosure: I purchased all of my $10P listed above when stock was around $11.00 today. I've already made 5%-15% gains on all of them, but I'm long here. Stocks been pumped a bit this week... but if stock hits $8.50 by 8/21 (**very possible)**, you're looking at 300% gains here."

Seven Democratic Senators including Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren sent the letter to Attorney General William Barr on Thursday urging him to act carefully when evaluating Google‚Äôs intentions of buying Fitbit.

Senators are afraid of the company‚Äôs monopoly saying that Google, through many acquisitions, already sealed its supremacy in several sectors. They noted that ""adding Fitbit‚Äôs consumer data to Google‚Äôs could further diminish the ability of companies to compete with Google in ... ad technology markets and could raise barriers for potential competitors to enter these markets.""

Google announced Fitbit's acquisition in November last year but pledged that it would not use Fitbit‚Äôs health data to help its marketing.

So,  you will want to consider to  buy calls on Vix for august and then puts for the election, probably strike 20 and 24 on the puts and probably strike 30-35 for the calls on Vix.



As for SPY, consider selling Call credit spreads on strikes $325/330 and as we drop lower, sell the $320 calls etc.

SPY will go to 318 or atleast 315 tomorrow if more sell-off.

So if you can afford the puts, consider to grab the otm puts at 915am tomorrow on SPY and close them the same day if they go into profit.


As for TQQQ wait for $100 or even $90 and start to buy TQQQ there.

SPXL should go down to $42-ish at some point, that is the buy in zone for me.. I will be buying shares and selling calls up top.

I bought TSLA, AAPL and SLVR at the bell and I was hopeful when I bought 'em.

I sent you two bears, it was hard but I caught em,

But shit's looking red so maybe you haven't fucked 'em in the bottom?

There probably was a problem at the mint or somethin'

Sometimes printers jam, I know a repair man, you should call 'im."
