No, Dale, you can Google it like the rest of us. It requires one exposure to the concept of googling to understand how it works. Your generation was smart enough to cause a total economic collapse out of malice, but not smart enough to type in a few words, I guess. ""I'm not tech savvy"", No, you just refuse to learn like in most things, you are stuck in your ways. The worst part is after you help an old fuck with sort of tech bullshit 9 times out of 10, they'll give you some kind of bullshit passive-aggressive thank you along the lines of ""Oh, I guess you young people have to know something about those phones you're always on, huh?"". Give me a fucking break Gretchen, I have depression from living in the economy you created and my phone is more of a reprieve than dealing with your stubborn, inconsiderate ass. AND ANOTHER THING that just gets my blood boiling is their ability to get into their settings, completely fuck things up, and then manage to develop total amnesia about how it happened. What do you mean you set your phone to Japanese on accident, Phil? There's like 15 separate menus you have to navigate through to get there. ""I think it's because I got a virus"". No, Greg, It's not a virus, the only viruses here are your rampant stupidity and the deadly pathogens carried by your unvaccinated grandchildren.

As far as I understand a major shareholder redistributed their shares to their own funds (I think? They have like 9 separate funds) and it set off a panic. Nothing fundamentally changed with the underlying's bleak financials and the shares weren't on the open market. I'm curious to see if it'll rebound after a few days or if this is the beginning of the end.

Daily reminder that the current sentiment is retard greed.  


Just 1 month ago, we were in fear mode. Why? Because fear of tariffs. What do tariffs look like today? *Exactly the fuckin' same,* nothing has been rolled back and no significant ag purchases and nothing has been put in writing; in fact we're getting reports that talks are at a sticking point regarding commitments to ag purchases and/or enforcement mechanisms. I believe the chance for additional tariffs in December is higher than is generally believed.  


Just 1 year ago, we were in extreme fear mode. Why? A combination of tariffs, quantitative tightening, and slowing growth/recession fears. With quantitative tightening in place, we still managed 2.2% GDP growth in Q4 of 2018, so you could say the December correction was unfounded panic and hence why it was bought up quickly. This year, with *rate cuts* and *quantitative easing*, we are only predicting a Q4 GDP of 1% or less. In other words, there is *more reason now* to fear a recession than there ever has been in years. If Tariff Man decides to go with the December tariffs after all, I guarantee you that will start the recession. It's a horrible idea but that's never stopped him before.  


We also know that recessions typically begin with a blow off top, and that this top usually comes after a yield curve inversion. We also can see that most recessions began when the Shiller PE ratio was approaching or at 30. In 2008, the recession began only a couple months after the market had peaked. Just some stuff to think about."

After a disappointing WAY OTM 12/20c QSR (FUCK YOU TIM HORTONS) I have decided to give the magical credit spread a go. 


Scenario: Bull Spread on TSLA 340/330 (TSLA is @346). This the premium on this bad boy is like $410 for an investment of $578... Now this sounds dope but I also know this is probs too good to be true and super risky? Maybe doing something similar to disney too. Anyways

Things I know: 

* How to buy them lol
* What they Are 

What I don't know: 

* How to close them (Robinhood)
* When to close it (just let it expire?)
* How wide my short & long positions should be 
* How deep ITM to place my short position
* How to make sure I don't lose my ass 
* How dumb is the above scenario 

I am thinking of starting smaller but this play was just one I was looking at.
