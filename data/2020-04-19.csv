Please understand that today’s France is not the France we all think we know.  We know the France that surrendered after a few days fighting the greatest threat the world had ever seen.   Many French died in that short time.

That was many years ago.

Now they would simply tweet their surrender before the the first bomb is launched.  

And whoever sent the tweet will probably get a medal for all the lives they saved.

I guess what I’m trying to say is “you’re welcome we exist, France.”

In late April, the word had already gotten off of the mainland markets that there is a BEAR FLU in the market that kills USO holders (boomers). A few weeks later, BEAR FLU started to kill SPY, TSLA, AMZN holders too.

Outbreak in BULLS will get worse over the couple of weeks, BULLS are required to follow 30 days rule to slow down BEAR FLU. No checking on trading platforms, quarantine away from market places.

We need ICU beds and stimulus program for BULLS before they go bankruptcy and go $ROPE."

Morning calls on chewy. Unless it opens red...in which case look to dump my 4/24 CHWY puts if they are printing...then grab CHWY calls. Have you heard they sell dog food, not just ""chewy"" toys? Fuck yeah.. tons more people are adopting pets and duhh of course gonna buy online from the Amazon of dog food (even tho dog food is cheaper or as cheap on Amazon still and I can buy it there...which is why I still like my puts.... And may buy more for later if it moons too much.

Calls on Disney. Laid of tons of workers. The market loves layoffs. Hopefully an initial knee jerk dip let's me get the calls cheaper. 

Calls on ATVI...just cuz 50,000 autists or wanna be autists can't be wrong, right? 

Calls on Dominoes - same theory. 

Short Gild, hopefully it pumps more maybe ride the wave a day then good put prices prices get better. 

Not touching spy options for a while as part of my 🌈🐻 recovery program. I wonder if my sponsor/counselor will mind if I buy calls on spxu if tomorrow's another green dildo? 

Alright, got the plan down. 4 hours of sleep then 4/20 rip spesh with some add focusing hyper sativa fueled by some addy and Colombian coffee and let's do this. Gnight. Hope I don't complete my 40k to zero in 30 days here, wish me luck.

If I'm looking to hedge the market- and FX risk of a position, let's say my native currency is EUR, should I then consider my market hedge position in my FX hedge?
Consider the scenario: I own stocks in USD, and to hedge these stocks I short S&P500 Futures. My market risk is now neutralized, but I still have to hedge my FX risk. Should I then buy EUR/USD futures in the amount to cover my position in stocks, or should I buy EUR/USD futures in the amount to cover my position in stocks minus my position in the S&P500?

I guess that my short position in the S&P500 Futures is also implicitly a short position on the USD, why I should buy EUR/USD to cover my stocks minus my position in the S&P500, but I can't this in a source anywhere.

What do you think, and do you know if there is a source anywhere mentioning this?"

This law helped to lead the largest sustained period of economic growth in US history, a 60-year expansion in the middle class, the largest increase in productivity, the largest increase in median income. During the act, USA also won World War 2, put a man on the moon and a computer in everyone's lab."

Few reserves, no ability to sustain themselves without bailouts after just a few weeks.
What will all this look like on the other side?

The US economy rollout *can* happen earlier than expected, but that doesn’t mean spending will resume the previous drumbeat, or that workers will come back in tune to before, and that’s what markets are missing. 

But when it will hit valuations? Future guidance and July earnings should speak volumes, so wait to place any major downside bets. Euphoria reigns, for now."

I will hold some of them. But I feel like the earnings are not going to be nice. AMD hasn't done well post earnings in the last 2-3 earnings. So might switch to puts.

I also have tqqq calls from 40-60 all 5/1. Will prob sell them looking at how the INTC earnings are 

Relative to their revenues the AMD pricepoint doesn't make any sense. Everyone is banking on more server sales. But if there's anything I figured out during the last earnings are that they sell their compute -both CPUs and GPUs to cloud companies -AWS, Azure, GCP at a loss.

If green tomorrow then hopefully buying 4/24or 5/1 $LVS PUTS before Wednesday’s ER. Not sure about strike price but probably something near ITM. 

Macao closure Q1 gonna expose how much money they are losing rn. Expecting a drop to the low $40s after hours, sell sometime Thursday or Friday. 

I know Vegas might open soon and the stock might moon on this news, but I am willing to take that risk. 

If red tomorrow, then I will probably hop back into AMD Calls for 5/1 or 5/15 and possibly start riding the wave that is $BA. 

Thoughts?

In other words, selling volume has been higher during price declines than buying volume during price increases yet the price has been trending up. This divergence is a signal for trend reversal. However ES! volume is not as significant as SPY volume during trading hours.

It will be interesting to see how long this divergence will last."

AAPL has earnings on Apr 30, and MSFT on Apr 29.

If both of those companies miss, that sets us up for a downtrend into the May 8 BLS unemployment numbers, which would feed any flames residual from poor tech earnings.

If AAPL and MSFT miss but the market doesn't react, I'm abandoning my 5/15 puts and rolling out to 9/18s.

We’re at levels from October 2019 in the S&P500. That’s insane to me. We’re only down 15% from highs and up 28.5% since March 23rd.

Certain companies are almost back to new highs or are making new highs. That’s ridiculous. 20% unemployment is unfathomable, yet the stock market is soaring.

4. Market already dipped 35%

7. Tech booming due to stay at home economy

Like, wtf? They have to oppose everything he does. 

Now, if he opens the country up and someone dies they’ll say Trump acted too quickly and he’s killing people. If after he opens the country and everything is fine the media will say Trump waited too long. 

He can never win. They can’t give him a win. That is the most unacceptable outcome to the media even if it makes themselves look dumb."

They speak about the market like a living, breathing, untamable menace, like the way Melville described the fucking white whale. What pisses me off is that some English Lit major who doesn't know what that weird ""%"" sign means (""010? Who knows?"") is working at CNBC and affecting thousands, if not millions, of autistic trades a week."

2020-04-19 22:35:27,Donexodus,5,"A word of caution about your GILD puts.

Nucleoside analogs work in general.  That's what Remdesivir is.  The studies coming out will do one of three things.  1.  Show no improvement.  2.  Show some improvement.  3.  Show large improvement.

I don't believe #1 will come true for a variety of reasons, and if it does, congrats, you win, so I wont spend time talking about it.

Option 2:  This is highly probable.  Assuming the leaked data is not 100% incorrect, Remdesivir will be shown to help.  Here's the thing though- even if there were bad side effects, even if the effect is a tiny 5% reduction in mortality, the news will absolutely jump on it and claim we've made significant progress and the drug has been proven to work!  Even if its not feasible to become a mainstream treatment, GILD will soar on this news, whether its true or not.

Option 3:   Also probable.  Remdesivir has been shown to work in vitro in monkeys.  Again, these drugs tend to work very well.

I'm not suggesting you should be long in GILD.  I don't necessarily believe it will be the main treatment.  What I do believe is that there is a VERY good chance of it having some positive effect.  If it does, GILD is likely to go up.  People need hope right now, and news orgs will jump at the chance to give it to them.  Reporters are also atrocious at reporting on science.  I see it every day.  They sensationalize a study showing almost zero positive result with a minute sample size riddled with problems.

FWIW I have a heavy scientific background and extensive experience picking apart scientific papers.  GILD may tank, but I see a lot of people posting about their GILD puts, and wanted to shine some light on a possible hidden danger."
