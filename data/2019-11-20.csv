2019-11-21 00:24:52,uninfinity,6,"   **Trump Blames Beijing for Lagging Trade Talks**   

 

AUSTIN, Texas -- President Trump criticized China's        efforts to reach a trade agreement during a visit to a Texas        plant where Apple Inc.        is assembling its new desktop computer.     

Mr. Trump toured the Austin        facility with Apple        Chief Executive Tim Cook on Wednesday as the White        House sought to promote job creation and economic growth against        the backdrop of a continuing trade war with Beijing.        Few signs of progress have emerged since a plan for a limited ""phase        one"" deal was announced nearly six weeks ago.     

Asked if he would secure a pact by the end of the year, Mr. Trump said, ""China        would much rather make a trade deal than I would"" and added, ""I haven't        wanted to do it yet. Because I don't think they're stepping up to the        level that I want."""

The STOCK act signed in 2012 was a good one and prevented congress from insider trading from doing it. This news is common knowledge and spread quickly through the media as a great thing. Congress amended it a year later (deleted a shit ton of it that mattered) in 2013 and this was also signed off in a matter of a few emails. It was not really publicized.

2019-11-20 22:25:07,knotswag,14,"**Magical Crayons TA** time.

We had a slight pullback today to fill our last gap but are still outside the bottom end of the range I'm expecting. [Here is the crayons](https://imgur.com/j0kJllF) and you can see at the gold line is the trendline for a ""healthy"" rise in the market (right now would be approx 307). My expectation is that will be support and we'll make a move back up if we hit it. 

Is that greater drop incoming? As I've said previously it's hard to say, only that signs are it will come. Let's take a look at crayons for futures quickly. [We've tested](https://imgur.com/Q4ShbIq) one of supports (purple line) I and /u/flowkingfresh were [discussing last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyqrp2/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_20/f83oyp4/) and we've successfully bounced off it. What is likely to happen is at some point we'll break that support and challenge the bottom one, at approx 8220, which should coincide with approximately hitting the SPY range I mentioned above and complete the small correction that I've been expecting the market to have to continue its bullish run. I anticipate that will be a strong support, but breaking of that support with vigor will be a substantial signal towards a bigger correction than the one I've outlined.

For now we've seen an uptick in buying volume that challenged the selloff quite well, reinforcing that we're in a bull market-- there are still lots of people that view dips as entry points and not selling points. So unless drastic news hits we should be pretty okay. As I mentioned, buying if we hit 307 should still be pretty safe-- breaking down past that will be putting us into the neutral trading zone, which can be more difficult to play and is where theta gang hangs out and you know what it's like on their side of town.

Anyway, best of luck and let's get those tendies boys."

I shit myself, haven't seen that big of a loss since i yolod my entire account into calls in 2018 and lost it all overnight. I was raging at the world, and myself for being so fucking dumb, blaming the market, telling my gf im done forever, but instead of cutting my losses like i would have in the past, i decided to just see what happens.

 Robinhood sold my contracts at 3:00 for only a $60 loss. I am hyped, and i don't even care that my contracts would have actually expired worthless if RH didn't sell them at 3. Thanks for reading my story, i live to reeee another day.

I saw us start to drop and bought half way down and was like cool, making up for the money I lost on my calls. Then it stopped and immediately reversed and I wasn’t paying attention and now I’m looking at a nice loss. Like I’m all for being a bull but this market never goes down. What the fuck?"

2019-11-20 21:16:47,oregon_forever,3,Fun fact: Aramco used to be a multi-national partnership but Saudis kicked their foreign partners out and nationalized the company after it became very profitable in 1970s. That's probably what they'll do again once they get money from sucker investors.

i think LB and M both fail to beat earnings but i also think it's possible that their failure is p r i c e d i n so idk how much movement i predict in either direction. 

but again today has me feeling weird and iffy about the market so while i already knew nothing i now feel like i know even less"
