2020-07-17 09:40:09,haasvacado,5,"I’m not good at this so take this for what it is: a random idiot behind a screen who looked at a graph. 

The Nasdaq has basically executed a V shaped recovery and it is at the point, theoretically, that it would have been at without the March incident. As far as Nasdaq is concerned, it seems reasonable to conclude that the stimmy worked.

Looking forward, however, do we really think it can keep chugging upward if certain very important stimulus measures are not extended? Specifically, the unemployment benefits, the PPP requirement not to lay-off workers until Oct 1, and the various loan, rent, and mortgage payment measures expire. 

It’s hard to find a reason why stonks should still go up IF THESE STIMMY MEASURES ARE NOT EXTENDED. Isn’t like 70% of US GDP based on consumer spending? Banks are obviously building a wall of capital against the likelihood that no new stimmy will come. This isn’t r/politics but damn so much depends on the US congress right now and that is not the sign of a healthy market with implications for the very short term. 

It’s so uncomfortable to entertain the idea that the stock market is (functionally) government-run right now. Obviously I’m going to keep buying calls because puts never print but damn. Knife’s edge. 

Tdlr: it’s probably up to the US congress to prevent another march in the very short term and that is a terrifying thought."

2020-07-17 08:49:47,Cyrusis,14,"**TIP:**

The Oxford Team, who are creating by far the most promising and globally watched vaccine is expected to release their current data on Monday.

This team developed a SARS1 vaccine years ago, and have had the advantage in being able to modify that vaccine for SARS2 (COVID-19). The initial vaccine already has years of safety testing as well. They have locked in mass production and distribution partners, and their vaccine is slated to release by the end of 2020 or by early 2021. They also intend to sell the vaccine shot at cost during the pandemic.

There have been reports of the vaccine being highly effective, producing both antibodies and killer T-cells (which stay in the body for years).

Positive press release from AstraZeneca Plc and the Oxford Team on Monday will send the markets up without a doubt. Travel stocks likely to see the largest bump.

Hope that helps for those who are unaware.

2020-07-17 08:32:46,scopolamine,34,"Lessons for newbie WSBs:

1. ONLY trade stocks below $1. The lower stock price is, the more upside there is.
2. Always use MARGIN. Margin lets you increase the amount of stock/options you can hold but limits your risks hugely.
3. IRS only charges on tax gain if you hold them more than 1 day. Make sure to sell before market closes every day.
4. If you are long on commodities, make sure to sign a physical settlement and give your address.
5. Using a market order during day is a rookie mistake, always use pre or post market hours where you get better fills.
6. You only incur a loss if you sell. If you never sell, there is no loss.

Remember only rich people trade stocks/options, if you are not doing it, you are poor."

2020-07-17 06:44:13,VJKWXE,12,"Some cheap trade ideas for you all:

1. Selling 7/24 OTM AAL puts for earnings next Thursday is looking like free money right now. There's just no way they go below $10 like it's corona panic szn. It could be bad but the $9 range was reserved for when people thought they were going bankrupt.


2. NKLA puts as overvalued hype stocks begin to pop with earnings next week...oh and as people realize that they're a fucking fraud and even if they weren't, there's no space in the market between Tesla, Rivian, and the big auto manufacturers producing their own EVs.


3. PENN calls for mid-August. Casinos will only further re-open, the NHL is about to put on the greatest staging of gambling days the country has ever seen as we all sit at home, starved of sports and entertainment, with constant live action that no one can predict going from 12PM-12AM every day, and their ER on Aug. 5th that you know they're going to cook the shit out of.


4. Buy SHARES (shudder) of CHGG. Literally every kid across the country (and the world) is about to be using this this coming semester for schoolwork help (oh and cheating) from home. They're also already a profitable company unlike a lot of the unicorns out there, the valuation isn't insane, and there should be a good buying opportunity over the next few weeks as it pulls back from the tech run that has fizzled this week."

Only thing I can see happening is you making less money sometimes if the share price skyrockets. 

For example TSLA $1570 7/24 is at $100.88. 

So you sell for $10,880. Even if the stock price goes to $1700 by then and your forced to sell, you still are selling for more than you bought. Plus you’ve gotten the premium. 

If stock price falls you just hold your shares and sell another call the next week and keep making $$. 

Am I stupid or is this free money? I’ve never sold a call or looked into it as I don’t have too much to play with yet, just a couple thousand. 

And before you say you need $150k to do that with TSLA, I know. Can be replicated with a cheaper stock."

Young Jerome watches through tears as his mother comes home from work at her fifth job and vows to reduce wealth inequality in the United States.

And in a second, the memory is gone. Emperor Jerome shakes his head, grabs a megaphone, and barks to his slaves, ""WORK FASTER, YOU LAZY FUCKING DIPSHITS!!!"" When they fail to work at a faster rate, Emperor Jerome grabs a shotgun and remarks, ""It's 🐻 season...."""

Delisting and a real war are both extremely unlikely, delisting especially as it would hurt US investors and would increase Chinese wealth. Trade war is possible I guess but doesn’t seem likely as long as our economy is fucked which should be a while and I don’t really see Biden starting one either.

The trend was broken yesterday because of the floods and the Chinese market sold off, despite a rebound in DIX. If we return to the trend we should see a solid green day for both.

Buy a single 12/2022 put for spy $85? lets say market takes a dump in the next 6 months and we drop to like spy 270, can profit a bit with some premium right? or the market dumps itself all the way to spy 150,the premium should rise quite a bit? i can see spy hitting 200ish or 150 even if this truly is a dead cat bounce.

or just buy a 12/2022 put debit spread for spy 250/230 if you think it will hit 230 by then? even if spy hits 250 well before, you should profit? as these spreads have a large bid/ask and the spread should tighten as spy drops. i believe the average cost is around $300 to $400 for this spread. if prints before december 2022, max profit is nearly $1600."

Nobody ever talks about why it happens. Just that it happens. Why would anyone do that?

I feel that there's an implication that there's some sort of metaphysical shit going on to where the old are essentially siphoning off energy from the youth, and that's what keeps them... living? Feeling good? Maybe these old pedophiles are living in a constant orgasm and we're just now stepping on their toes with asking all of these questions.

I was at my girlfriends house tonight for dinner, and shortly after i had to go #2. My Gf's brother was in the downstairs bathroom, so i went upstairs to use the master bathroom. I was about to take a dump, and I remembered something my friend told me called AC Slatering. AC Slatering is when you take a dump facing backwards on the toilet, just how on saved by the bell AC Slater always sat backwards on a chair. So when I was taking a dump, My stomache was facing the back of the toilet, and my back was facing the door. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and began to get nervous. Since AC SLatering is a tough position to get into, it requires taking off your pants. So there I am sitting in my GF's parents bathroom taking a dump with my pants off and facing the wrong way on the toilet. My dump was about halfway out when the footsteps became closer. I then turned around to see that I had not locked the door. Trying to finish as quickly as I could, I began pushing harder and harder. Suddenly, the door opened, and my gf's mom stood there in shock staring at me. We made eye contact for a split second, and I was so embarassed I wanted to die. I quickly finished up, got dressed, and ran out of the house as quickly as I could. I am expecting my gf to break up with me tommorow. I am so embarassed and I hope my gf doesnt blabber about this, Ill die if anyone else finds out."

But those were mostly oil calls and apparently that’s the only shit that can keep going down forever.

Granted, I worked in the oilfield, so I’ve been fucked for a while. If the gov’t passes another stimulus check, it’s going to the lower classes so they literally don’t die. But more stimulus and extension of higher unemployment benefits at some point means inflation, right? Right?? And oilfield can’t just magically come back strong. We need demand for that O&G, which just isn’t there. For now, at least, as COVID-19 is still on the menu, hamstringing that demand. Looks like it’s spreading, maybe not super fast. Florida is probably gonna be KO’ed, but that’s just 1 state. So how can we keep rocketing up? We all just... putting our savings into the market and doing nothing productive? Coronavirus has (surprisingly to me) caused a baby-bust not boom. No one wants to bring children into this world. At least those are the headlines from a couple days ago, populations will grow less than forecast. Good for the planet, not so much for our future retirement. So I don’t know. I think the market can be irrational plenty longer. But like... at SOME point, we are all fucked. Market, economy, all of it. Is that when we get drafted?"

Had ample opportunity to go back to the well and hop into FB calls around 236 but was just too nervous after the 232 fiasco a couple days ago. Would have been one of the better day trades on a very flat day. Used the flatness to snag a few cheap ass 318p 7/17 at close. Still holding a single day trade on the week, might make it a fun Friday. Still Bullish at heart but puts just seem lower risk higher reward in the short term until we break past 323.

2020-07-16 22:24:40,Ravin_J,11,Guys NFLX will be just fine in a week. It's a solid company and it is too reliable to drop this much at once. Their EPS was lower than expected but It was still higher than average. Whenever a big company has a sudden drop it always recovers. Most companies that drastically fall off do it over years (Ford and Gamestop for example). Look at Facebook and Bed Bath & Beyond. They both dropped heavily but returned in a week or so. I did take a big loss on NFLX  today but I'm not selling. In fact I'm buying more.

2020-07-16 22:23:26,tropicalia84,9,Netflix was this price a week ago. They dropped hard because they had a crazy run up into earnings. They missed EPS against lofty expectations but revenue and subscribers are up against really strong competition with everyone and their mom coming out with streaming services. To think it’s going to drag down all sectors is silly. All banks have crushed earnings and the other sectors didn’t rocket up.

I don't want to disrespect his memory by making unsafe wagers with the money he saved; he was a construction worker and careful saver.

I've heard a lot of advice from different people here. Some guy told me to ""yolo put"" $NFLX at open tomorrow??

I don't really know what that means. But I think he's a gay fucking bear. I asked my aunt Sharon, who's still with us: ""Fuck that, honey."" she said. ""Don't be a fucking autist and yolo call 7/24 $MSFT.""

I don't know what that means either.

Please help.

To finish it all off, some guy named SirBeast or MrMonster or something said something about Jan 15 $TSLA calls. ""Fuck you, you ree-ree payslave,"" I said to him. ""I don't wanna buy your fuck-stick boomer stock."" He then showed me a Robinhood shot with multiple millions in his 'play account.' I subsequently then offered to either 1. Bend over and take his huge green $TSLA bull cock, or 2. Suck every last ounce of one of his friends red diamondhands 7/24 $NFLX yolo call he said he was planning on buying at open. Anyway, can't decide whether to take a big bull cock or slob a gay bear knob. Either way, I know my great uncle Autist (his given name) would be proud. Because I've learned something today."

2020-07-16 21:57:58,heartstesler,3,"The Nasdaq Composite has managed to go two months without posting back-to-back declines. That record streak was under threat after Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s big after-hours drop sent exchange-traded funds tracking the tech space reeling.

The index, heavily weighted to megacaps like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., was already down 0.7% in Thursday’s regular session, as investors rotated out of tech in favor of laggards like airlines and energy. An ETF tied to its sister index, the Nasdaq 100, dropped more than 1% after the close.

A retreat Friday July 17,2020 in the larger Nasdaq Composite would end the 43-day stretch without posting losses two days in a row.

Two down days in a row hardly proves that tech shares’ 2020 dominance is coming to an end, but the trend has shown signs of cracking in recent weeks."

2020-07-16 21:41:36,bentosekai,0,"I’m honestly really grateful that I learned such an important lesson during my first week of options trading; my strangle on WBA with 7/17 expiry was up as much as 200% last week (I had a bearish position), but I got too fixated on holding it to see where it would go and now it’s about to expire worthless tomorrow. My 7/17 CCL puts also got absolutely destroyed by the moderna pump, so now I’m tracking vaccine press releases and making sure to play options at least two weeks out to avoid making the same mistake. The CCL, RCL, and PLAY puts I bought at the top yesterday are doing fairly well, but more than anything I have peace of mind knowing my cruiseline puts don’t expire until the 31st (and my PLAY puts expire next month).

Considering the fact that I came up with an OTM put/call combination on WBA before even knowing what a strangle was, I feel like I’m catching onto things reasonably wall so far; I just need to manage my risk a bit better (and sell a lot earlier lol).

Current positions (that aren’t worthless):
1. 5 x NOK $5C 1/21/22 bought @ $0.82
2. 5 x CCL $16P 7/31 bought @ $1.28
3. 6 x PLAY $12.50P 8/21 bought @ $1.65
4. 2 x RCL $55P 7/31 bought @ $4.50

Try pricing that in bitches. Oh you couldn't? Didn't think so! Not only because it's blowing your mind, but it will also blowing you soon as well.

Apple? Don't even think about selling that shit. They will soon own you, so you at least having one share will entitle you to having a piece of your freedom left.

So it’s pretty weird to me that she has been taking over for me for at least two weeks now and we’ve never said a word to each other. She stands off to the side so that She’s close enough so that I know I am able to leave, but she’s far enough that I would have to walk over to be able to talk to her. Every other machinist that has ever taken over for me will walk up and greet me and ask questions like “how was your day?” “How is the machine running today?”, “anything I need to know?”, or just a plain “I got it, you can go”. I know she’s a girl, but I’m not about to force any conversation. You would think that she would at least ask if there’s anything that she needs to know, because we sometimes have to make changes to the machines. It’s just kind of weird to me I guess🤷🏾‍♂️...."

Already watched all the original shit, not much reason to use it, cheap enough to not bother cancelling. Then quarantine hit and suddenly everyone's got theirs running 24/7 and it's not like we're paying more to use it. All that leads to is increased server usage = increased cost to run.

It's like how one of Moviepass' core strategies was to hope people just simply don't use their pass every month. Netflix doesn't want people to run it all day; unless they start throwing ad's up.
