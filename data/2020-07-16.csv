2020-07-17 09:40:09,haasvacado,5,"I’m not good at this so take this for what it is: a random idiot behind a screen who looked at a graph. 

The Nasdaq has basically executed a V shaped recovery and it is at the point, theoretically, that it would have been at without the March incident. As far as Nasdaq is concerned, it seems reasonable to conclude that the stimmy worked.

Looking forward, however, do we really think it can keep chugging upward if certain very important stimulus measures are not extended? Specifically, the unemployment benefits, the PPP requirement not to lay-off workers until Oct 1, and the various loan, rent, and mortgage payment measures expire. 

It’s hard to find a reason why stonks should still go up IF THESE STIMMY MEASURES ARE NOT EXTENDED. Isn’t like 70% of US GDP based on consumer spending? Banks are obviously building a wall of capital against the likelihood that no new stimmy will come. This isn’t r/politics but damn so much depends on the US congress right now and that is not the sign of a healthy market with implications for the very short term. 

It’s so uncomfortable to entertain the idea that the stock market is (functionally) government-run right now. Obviously I’m going to keep buying calls because puts never print but damn. Knife’s edge. 

Tdlr: it’s probably up to the US congress to prevent another march in the very short term and that is a terrifying thought."
