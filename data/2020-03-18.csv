2020-03-19 10:38:18,Flanktotheright,44,"1. SPY testing 2018 low at 234 - key support level
2. Bear wedge on hourlies candlesticks - showing while we saw two massive limit downs, the bear trend may be slowing down. If we see an hourly doji or dragonfly on open, then I'm going to say it's a massive bull signal.
3. Hourly highs on 246, trend line resistance at 243. If we break 243, then the bulls will test  246, if we break 246 then the next hourly high is at 257.

In the next \*two\* days - If SPY closes below 234 and we see hourly lower lows, then bears are in complete control and we see another freefall. If SPY breaks 246, then I see a potential for a face-ripping rally. All institutional putholders with expirations this week will have to gamma-hedge by buying up massive positions, and all short traders will close their positions. If we break 257 by Friday, then the bulls are hitting back fast and hard.

The way I see it, IF SPY to drop past 234, then we risk another week of circuit breakers and market makers will see liquidity issues of historical proportions. The heart of US financial systems will come close to death. The feds will do EVERYTHING to prevent this from happening.

Crude is up 13% which is a massive signal that today is going to be a bull day. Energy IS the market.

Going to go in with a 4x diagonal spread long 23MAR 260 and short 20MAR 255. If I'm totally wrong, I lose $120. Depending on the direction the market goes by end of day, I'll gear up on bare calls/puts for Friday.

EDIT: SPY trading at 238 premarket despite DOW down almost 600 points. Employment numbers will come out, we will see if it's priced in soon. 5 min candlesticks confirm the 234 support, very very important"

Anyway, my first CFD on the Germany 30 triggers a stop. Down $100.

Next I make $175 on Hong Kong HS50. Nice.

I make a few small bets on Germany 30 - pocket $36 here, $6 there, $2.80 (really small stuff).

Okay... how about I try ITALY! Big mistake...

I try a sell CFD and before I know it, it's gone. No position. Looks like it didn't work.

So I try it again and BAM it's gone. No position. Now I'm negative in my account. What the hell?

I check my balance history. Sure enough - two stops triggered on Italy. Lost $185 twice. But wait - there's another two lots of $90 charges - the hell is this? Turns out the platform I'm using has a penalty if a stop is triggered - and it's a whopping 24 points for the Italy 40.

Lesson learned. All up lost AU$500 on not-having-a-clue. Will be more wary of CFD in the future."

If this thing is so widespread that Tom Hanks and Idris Elba have it, the worldwide cases have to be way higher than what we think. I.e. there’s no way there’s only 10k cases in the US and they happen to have so many prominent people among them (congressmen, actors, basketball players, etc.)

At the end of the day I think the fatality rate is going to be much lower than what we are estimating when we divide it by the mild and asymptomatic cases, and when we realize that it’s going to be rocket ship to the fucking moon with all this stimulus.

2020-03-19 06:30:35,,7,"Being the autist I am, I was pondering about the implications of the term ""chinese virus"".

On one hand I can see the rationale. Just like people call the flu that came from Spain the Spanish Flu, the virus that originated in China is the Chinese virus.


However, the stickler is that the word Chinese not only denotes a nationality, but also a race. In which case, those whose race is chinese but have nothing to do with the virus are also inadvertantly getting affected. Since the negatives outweigh the almost negligible positives, I've come to the autistic conclusion that I'll now consider the use of the phrase ""chinese virus"" as racially insensitive.

Thank you for coming to my late night Ted talk."

Buy puts on movie theatres. They’re absolutely fucked.

- Movies and pretty much everything requiring a camera is shut down. No one is going to see anything, no one is going anywhere to shoot anything.

- They make all their money from overpriced snacks. IF people went to the movies, that big box of popcorn they’re scooping from is the literal opposite of what you’d want to get with corona still around.

- Their buildings are expensive to run, you know how it’s always cold as tits in those theatres? Think about how fucking big those fuckers are. Those projects are expensive to run too. Same with the sound. Plus the bright ass lights, the ancient arcades...yeah, power hungry bitch. 

- Their buildings are expensive to own, they often buy up high foot traffic areas and take up a LOT of surface area to stuff all those theatres in one building. Shit ain’t cheap.

- They were already declining in income and revenue, esp with Marvel being on hiatus. 

Get your butt in there kiddos. Shits gonna hit the same levels of fuckery as airlines but they’re not getting any bailout."

2020-03-19 05:12:37,realister,24,"**The Shadow War Theory what is happening right now?** 

Our markets are under a coordinated liquidity attack. Someone with a lot of capital is draining liquidity as market makers are forced to take on terrible losing positions to provide transactions for people trying to hedge. 

In a bull market hedge funds purchase calls to be long ""gamma"" and MMs make money by trying to capture ""rebates"" (spread) by taking on the opposite positions. This is how liquidity is provided. When a MM fills an investors buy order the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting the shares. They are forced to go short in order to sell a security they do not own. So the volume and LIQUIDITY is absolutely crucial for MMs to make profits.

During a downturn firms want to hedge using puts to be short ""gamma"" so Market Makers are buying up calls to provide this liquidity. Really really bad losing calls. If there is a buyer there has to be a seller otherwise we have a liquidity crisis and option prices goes haywire. 

So what is happening right now?

When someone is purchasing a large amount of puts the MMs take on huge unfavorable positions with calls on the opposite side of the trade. Right after the pump into close we have immediate huge fade after close. These huge swings after hours throw MMs into panic mode forcing them to either hedge by trading futures (driving them even more red) or selling shares at the open at significant loss magnifying the swings.

The risk for MMs here is that they can easily ""over hedge"" if the share price changes unexpectedly overnight. This is what they refer to as ""gap risk"" or ""inventory risk"". Large overnight moves create huge ""gamma"" swings which create periods of panic buying and selling which magnifies intraday swings as they desperately try to provide liquidity and reduce exposure. 

Given that we dumped today means institutions need to hedge with more puts. More puts purchased by funds means more calls purchased by MMs to provide liquidity. What happens after hours? We limit down again. So what happens if we open 4-5% down? MMs are stuck with worthless short term calls that they need to offload fast!

Why is this happening? 

Someone sinister is taking advantage of very poor liquidity in the markets forcing MMs to baghold terrible positions that they are have to offload in a panic fueling huge swings back and forth. Could it be Russia? China? Saudis? Illuminati? Rogue AI? Who knows but its clear someone with enough capital is taking advantage of the liquidity crisis forcing MMs to take on huge gap risks further draining liquidity.

**TL;DR** Liquidity issues can lead to a massive monumental sell off and the government needs to do something to fix this because if firms cannot stop the losses with hedges (because of the worsening bid price) they will sell off EVERYTHING until markets are shut down by the government.

Posted this earlier. Plan to sell SPY in the morning, probably right at opening. I'll probably have to sit on GLD for awhile until it goes green. I made some money off a JNUG call before, bought this one near the bottom and plan to see if I could do it again. The three puts I was recommended to hold until Friday if it goes deep red, and if not hold til Monday. These contracts tie up all my $ in my account, so I'll probably sell something that's in the green if I see a good opportunity. I'm mostly unsure how JNUG and GLD will play out. I really have no idea what/if I'll do any new trades other than getting a SPY put after I sell my call. Hopefully I'll see something good."

Then we went deep red to -4% and everyone was shitting them selves

We went to -3% after and things were looking bright


Then we hit -5% and we all thought we were fucked

* If recession hurts, people will leave their pricey gym and downgrade to Planet Fitness

Seriously nobody in real life that isn't watching markets has any fucking idea how much of a once in a life time this market is right now. It's insane. And fuck you if you're ANTI BUY THE DIP, eventually averaging down here will be good unless you think America is going to shit.

Imaging being alive and fully employed and having money during the 2008 crisis or dot com bubble or Oil shock. I've been waiting for a time like this. I have 60k in a 401k in bonds and 60k in cash and household income with my wife that puts 6k in the bank a month. Sure her 401k is eating shit and maybe overall we are down 10k...but it will be nothing compared to the gains over the next 5-7 years after this panic is finished.  


I'm still playing puts but I'm not YOLOing because at the end of all this...there's a shit ton of  tendies to be had on the way back up. We don't know when Coronoa will stop, but we do know it's not deadly enough to be stop 99.5% of us. And that, my friend, means we will recover."

2020-03-19 03:48:28,Rvin16,3,"Okay so listen. Since Friday is going to be Quadruple Witching, the first witching out of the fours (March, June, Sept., Dec.) tends to be a coin toss. Either negative day or positive day; 50/50. The last two are more bullish due to the season (Holidays = sales). High volatility which can crush your options on these days. Days after witching are hell since volatility is historically high and stocks trade lower. Given this market however we can probably see $SPY at 200 eow and then further down next week. This will cause a huge selloff next week. Careful if you have weeklies since you will be crushed. Thank you for my TED talk"

2020-03-19 03:46:33,Pogo1344,-5,"Honestly, does it make much sense buying a SPY put if you have $1-1.5k? I see the point if you have $10k+ to go all in for like 10 contracts but buying one just seems pointless. If you buy a 220p 4/17 or whatever, you aren’t making much money because you’re way OTM and the risk would be $1-1.5k for a return of maybe $100-300. That’s still on par with 10% ROI but it definitely isn’t tendies.

If you have more money and can buy 5+ contracts at a premium of $15+ then you can buy closer to ITM and the risk wouldn’t be as bad if you have a strong feeling that it’s going to drop and the profits would be more when it drops obviously. 

Am I wrong with my logic? I want to get in on the SPY puts but this $1k buying power I get while I wait for funds to clear makes it useless for me."

2020-03-19 03:26:16,cinemagical414,20,"So I'm really just waiting for the other shoe to drop here. Every financial crisis in American history (aside from stupid panic-induced bank runs and the oil/stagflation crisis) was caused by the exact same thing -- speculative leverage.

* Panic of 1819 - over-levered speculative investments in western land expansion
* Panic of 1837 - over-levered speculative investments in cotton farms
* Panic of 1857 -  in railroad startups
* Crash of 1929 - in every direction and industry (materials, construction, retail, autos, railroads, etc.) + in the market itself
* Black Monday (1987) - smooth-brained algorithmic portfolio hedging ""strategies"" + over-levered brokerages facing margin calls
* S&L Crisis - over-extended credit lines to shit-tier ventures + highly-levered speculative hedging
* Dot-com bubble - Imagine valuing an online grocery delivery start-up reporting less than $400K in revenue, during the dial-up internet era -- in the year of 1999 -- at $5 billion. This was Y2K-induced magical thinking by boomer investors placing highly leveraged bets on every empty LLC with ""dot-com"" in its name, and delusional boomer management in tech, media, and telecom (and other industries) going deep into debt to finance insane business plans fully reliant on internet speeds that took a full minute to download a gif.
* 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis - We all know this story. Let's extend insane amounts of credit to anyone with a pulse, bundle up the worthless contracts, stamp AAA on top, sell it to shit-tier mutual funds, borrow against it to take out massive amounts of insurance on it, take out even more insurance on it to bet against it because hey why the fuck not, and then let the perpetual free money machine do its thing. Use the perpetual free money machine to lever up investments everywhere else. Use those levered investments to make more levered investments. Call yourself CFO of Lehman Brothers.

So where in our banking system is it now? How have our illustrious bulge brackets and investment shops been fucking around while we weren't paying attention the last 10 years?

A few things I might explore:

* How levered are the REITs? If construction stalls out, is it enough for them to become insolvent?
* What are Blackstone & KKR up to? How much 'L' could there be hiding in their most recent LBOs?
* How fucked are Deutsche Bank & Morgan Stanley, both of which were a hair's-width away from going bankrupt in 2008? Is there any chance they learned their lesson?
* Who is treading water? Who has low quick ratios and high debt loads?
* Who is holding the bag? Who gave the shitty loans to the shitty companies this time?

May post further musings as I research and trade through tomorrow."

Never not improving. Pharma has some beautiful opportunities. Small caps literally with more revenues a year than their entire market cap lol. Overkill

I will provide a list of small caps when I feel they’ve reached bottom but without full US lockdown it’ll get worse. Really just started and I’m bullish generally, specially long term"

I’ve become a morning person (west coast) because of this crash and it doesn’t help that my base is making us work from home. So after the market closes, I’m like that Pablo meme.

I can’t see any reason to bet into calls unless you’re planning far out into 2021. It seems no matter what the government tries to do, the recession/bloodbath is inevitable. And because of that, I don’t know what to even invest cause it feels like we are close to hitting rock bottom."

Keep in mind that was right at the height of the recession, and yet the stock market had just rebounded right at the start (April 2009).  It went through two ""stages""/peak periods, and yet no economic shutdowns and market continued to boom from there.

Not saying we're making a mistake or anything, I just think it's really interesting to see how these measures are going to drastically effect people's lifes; many of whom won't end up even infected, for quite some time to come through this period.

FYI, I've seen Trump/many others say it'll take 18 months blah blah blah for vaccine and 1 year would be record etc. but according to [CDC timeline](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html), they had a vaccine by Sept; like 5 months.

I went to Walgreens to stock up on lube and hotdogs today. When I was in line to check out I made a joke about social distancing to this smokeshow blonde and she ate it up. We started chatting for a while, and she was giving me way more attention than my autistic, unshowered ass would normally get. She then told me how this was the most social interaction she’s had in 3 days given Kung flu lockdown. 

Here’s where the lightbulb went off - The single girls stuck at home due to cv fear feel isolated and lonely. They’ll stay in touch with their non-single friends and be reminded how single they are in comparison. So what do they do? They jump on online dating apps. 

Now, going long on dating apps seems counterintuitive since people can’t really date right? But these apps make money off users, not the dates themselves. In fact a successful date poses a threat to those users, so Kung flu is actually a good thing. Daily active users will skyrocket and next er season they’ll moon bigly. Oh, and for those wondering... You bet your ass I got her number 😉

Take TQQQ for example, I could've bought 100 shares for about $33-$34 a share today and either immediately sold a covered call a strike up for $600+ credit a little over a week out or just sell the 100 shares on a green day for $500-$1000 profit, AH it's at $41.91.

Considering a few different spots for calls depending on how much everything moves tomorrow. 

AAPL is also looking pretty enticing at current prices given their cash and market position. I’m sure there are plenty of degenerates out their who can’t wait to spend their Donny Bucks on a new iPad or iPhone instead of paying rent / utility bills. 

MCD has taken a beating just like most everything else. Was hoping to get in this afternoon but in meetings all day so may have missed a chunk of this trendies train. I think MCD is positioned more favorably to weather this shitstorm than typical sit down style restaurant chains. Granted DRI and it’s peers have tumbled far more than MCD. 

I already have some USO leaps. May add to the position tomorrow or Friday. Definitely a more long term play though."

2020-03-18 23:40:38,CroissantDuMonde,12,"**Highlights from Bill Ackman’s meltdown on CNBC today**: “I’m an optimist, but beginning in late January I was getting increasingly bearish. I woke up with a nightmare. And my nightmare was, you had this virus, that replicates and infects incredibly rapidly. Each person infects 2.5 people, each of whom infect 2.5 people. 1 becomes 2 becomes 4 becomes 16 becomes 256 becomes 55,000... And when China shutdown Wuhan, they told people ‘12 hours from now we’re gonna shutdown Wuhan.’ Well what happened? 5 million people left Wuhan. 5 million people dispersed around China. 5 million people dispersed around the world.... The laws of probability tell me this thing is going to be everywhere. Everyone, 50% of the world is going to get infected. It’s just a matter of time...  

“Until a vaccine is manufactured, distributed and injected, we will go through a depression-era period in the country. Millions of people will die around the globe. As many as a million Americans are gonna die... I think it‘s a very high probability millions of Americans have the virus. On February 27th I told the firm that we’re going to work from home. We have a small firm, we’ve got 50 people... we’ve been working from home for weeks and we’ve got 2 people that are likely to have the corona virus based on their symptoms... that’s 4% of our company and taking aggressive measures. It’s incredibly widespread...  

“What happened in Chinatown is a microcosm... this is a model for the country. Hilton is the canary in the coal mine. This is an incredibly well-capitalized, amazing, dominant, global company that actually doesn’t own many hotels. It just collects royalties. Down from like $120 to $50. It’s going to $0 along with every other hotel company. Every hotel is going to be shutdown in the country. Every one... I’m a major shareholder. If we allow this to continue... every hotel company in the world is done. No business can survive a period of 18 months without revenue. And that’s what happens if you operate the way we’re operating now...  

“The only answer for the world is to shut the world for 30 days. It’s so simple, its happening slowly on a rolling basis. You look at how South Korea and Singapore have handled this, but you need a global effort where every country at the same time says ‘for the next 30 days its basically spend time with your family.’... In a month, we’re done with this - the country survives, the economy survives. If we do this just incrementally over time, until there’s a vaccine, we’re done. What will happen is, the hotel industry and the restaurant industry will go bankrupt first. Boeing is on the brink, will not survive without a government bailout. So look at airline industry, auto industry, restaurant industry, hotel industry - capitalism doesn’t work in an 18-month shutdown. Capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown. We gotta do the 30-day shutdown. And if the president has to bring out the National Guard to keep people in their homes, which I don’t think he will need to do, he should do it.”

It's way too soon to know for sure, but if interest rates are going to rise despite the fed's efforts, it's a sign that it may be time to pay the piper. The bill on our historic recklessness is coming due a lot earlier than expected if we can't ramp up our economy very quickly after this."

2020-03-18 22:43:06,TheLordNermal,-3,"for me it helps me to just look at the option’s position relative to the current price of the underlying stock. for example if Stock ABC is at 20.00 and  there are puts for $22 $21 $20 $19 $18 and so on.  is ABC goes to 19.00, $19p will be in a similar price range to what $20p was when ABC’s price was at 20.00

I was just doing this for fun^ on r/investing, but I posted like 3 days ago (my only post so it's not like I kept calling the bottom), when we were 245ish, said we would test 225-230 and if we hold that by the of this expiration Friday, we might go into a slow recovery back to 300. If we don't hold it though then yea we are fucked. 

I mean I probably am not right but if I am that'll be pretty hilarious.  No matter what though the recovery will be slow, wherever we bottom. I'm more confident on that. This will not be a quick recovery up when we bottom."

EXACTLY 1 month later on February 21-24, which was precisely 1 month from when coronavirus was announced on january 21-24, the markets began to dump. whoever the people were knew what they were doing and squeezed out the last drop of the 11 year bull run before dumping it all at the end."

2020-03-18 21:37:02,Xinlitik,4,"Hopefully better things on the horizon


1) Vaccine development: An experimental vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. began the first stage of a clinical trial on Monday, with testing on 45 healthy adults in Seattle. [link]


(2) China's new cases plummet: China has now closed down its last temporary hospital built to handle COVID-19. Not enough new cases to warrant them. [link]


(3) Drugs that work: Doctors in India have successfully treated two Italian patients with COVID-19, administering a combination of drugs — principally Lopinavir and Ritonavir, alongside Oseltamivir and Chloroquine. Several are now suggesting the same medical treatment, on a case-by-case basis, globally. [link] [link]


(4) Antibodies to the rescue: Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center claim to have found an antibody that can fend off infection by COVID-19. [link]


(5) 103-year-old recovery: A 103-year-old Chinese woman has made a full recovery from COVID-19 after being treated for 6 days in Wuhan, China, becoming the oldest patient to beat the disease. [link]


(6) Stores re-opening: Apple has reopened all 42 of its Apple retail stores in China. [link]


(7) Test results in 2 hours: Cleveland’s MetroHealth Medical Center has developed a COVID-19 test that can now deliver results in just two hours, rather than in a matter of days. [link]


(8) South Korea's dramatic drop in new cases: After its peak of 909 newly reported COVID-19 cases on February 29th, South Korea has now seen a dramatic drop in the number of new cases reported daily. [link]


(9) Mortality rates inflated? Experts predict that Italy has seen a higher mortality rate of COVID-19 given its significant aging population, as well as its higher percentage of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing health conditions. This might suggest that COVID-19’s fatality rate may have been slightly more inflated than previously thought for the general population. [link]


(10) Israeli vaccine development: More than 50 scientists in Israel are now working to develop a vaccine and antibody for COVID-19, having reported significant breakthroughs in understanding the biological mechanism and characteristics of the novel coronavirus. [link]


(11) Full recoveries: Three patients in Maryland who tested positive for COVID-19 have now been reported to have “fully recovered.” [link]


(12) Isolated virus: A network of Canadian scientists isolated the COVID-19 virus, which can now be replicated to test diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. [link]


(13) Yet another vaccine in the works: San Diego biotech company Arcturus Therapeutics is developing a COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore. [link]


(14) Treatment protocols: Seven patients who were treated for COVID-19 at Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SFS) Hospital and Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital in India have recovered. The treatment protocol will be widely scaled to other hospitals. [link]


(15) Another treatment: Plasma from newly recovered COVID-19 patients (involving the harvesting of virus-fighting antibodies) holds promise for treating others infected by the virus. [link]


Some of COVID-19’s hardest hit nation victims are already emerging strong after peak infection, and biomedical innovators are tackling the virus at unprecedented speeds.


IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER… While everyone is concerned about the super-high mortality rate of this virus — which is calculated by the “number dead” divided by “the number who have tested positive” (currently ~8,000/200,000) — the denominator, i.e. the number infected is actually VERY hard to know because so few people have been tested.
It may well be that 10x more are infected but subclinical. So is the mortality rate 4% or 0.4%?
