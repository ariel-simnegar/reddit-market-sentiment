CrowdStrike (CRWD)Holdings Inc. topped Wall        Street estimates with quarterly results Thursday, and the        cybersecurity company's stock turned around after a typo in its outlook        was corrected.

CrowdStrike expects an adjusted loss of 9 cents to 8        cents a share on revenue of $135.9 million to $138.6        million in the fourth quarter, but the original press release        dropped the 1 from the top end of that range, making it $38.6        million."

A head and shoulders pattern is clear on the 1 month chart.  It dropped below its support and attempted to retest (also failed).  This is a clear sign of a market reversal.

Stonks are all at all times high.  Who the fuck wants to buy at all time highs?  Big money is going to take their profits before the bubble pops.

I’m not saying this as a bear or a bull, but it’s obvious the this rapid growth in the past few months is in need of a correction (4-5%) before it continues in whatever path it’s gonna go.

Tomorrow we release employment numbers.  Everyone is expecting good results (which means good results are priced the fuck in). Good results = small bump, and flat for a day,  anything less and we drop immediately.  Any other bad news and we drop immediately.

China still has not retaliated like they said they would.  Trump has taken a public stance on being fine waiting on a deal with China.  If he doesn’t impose tariffs, they’ll see it as a weakness.  HE’S NOT GOING TO PUSH BACK 12/15 TARIFFS.   No good trade-talk news is going to come anytime soon.
