Hedge if you need to here and hold on to your cash. Buying the dip here would be pretty retarded. Set buying prices for stocks you've wanted to buy for awhile and once they hit those marks don't be a pussy and buy them.

If Apple shits the bed for a few months, $200 per share is reasonable. Don't act like it can't happen. That bitch was $142 barely more than a year ago. 

Find stocks you wanted to buy but have been too high and set reasonable entry points then stick to them. 

If you want to go full gay, wait a few months, let them hit your entry points then buy 6 month out or further calls. Good mix of autism and not being retarded"

Germany is gonna be in a legit recession soon and it's gonna send shivers down everyone's spine. Remember, the dot com bubble was triggered by Japan's recession. All those stocks going parabolic is proof enough that we have some big sliding back to do and no amount of QE is going to stop it from effecting us. 

Corona is a traders wet dream because it allows funds to sell off with a good alibi and not trigger as much fear. All these funds are holding copious amounts of cash--a market crash isn't necessarily in their worst interest.

2020-02-24 04:34:21,raconteuring,21,"**LISTEN UP BOYS:** 

If you want a play for next week that won't already be instantly priced in, I've got one for you.

The first study from the clinical trials out of China are back. They were trying multiple different drugs to treat Covid-19. The main ones being lopinavir, ritonavir, abidol, and remdesivir.

According to this short study just released, lopinavir, ritonavir, and abidol were found to have no effect. (http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1182592.htm)

--

So that leaves us with Remdesivir.

Gilead ($GILD) made this as an attempt at an ebola drug, but it didn't work for ebola. They tested it on monkeys and in the lab on Covid-19, and had great results. They used it on the first US patient to get sick as soon as he developed pneumonia in their care in the hospital.

The doctors said that within 24 hours of him getting the treatment, he immediately improved. (Timestamped already: https://youtu.be/C04Ts8n0gXY?t=1632)

They also used Remdesivir on the french patient who recovered already. Sorry I have less data on that one. Those are the two known uses of the drug on humans so far.

On Feb 10, they started a clinical trial in Wuhan conducted by Chinese doctors. They sent something like 500-600 treatments for the study, but later an article was posted saying they had trouble finding more than a few hundred patients who hadn't already received treatment (so they could do a clean study). Apparently the majority of Chinese people admitted to the hospitals have been receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

WHO says that they expect to get the prelim results back on the Wuhan clinicals in 3 weeks (they said this thurs or fri).

I can near guarantee that results, good or bad, will leak before then. Because cmon...its China and its a big deal if this works or not.

I would expect to see any big insider plays before the results are actually announced.

--
**What does this mean?**

Many people have claimed that Gilead won't profit from the treatment. This was mostly claimed back when the problem was only in China, and only 5-10k confirmed cases at the time.

Now that we have outbreaks in many countries, there will be many new people that need Remdesivir if it turns out it works. Gilead has claimed they have a stockpile of the drug ready to go, and they also said they have started ramping up production of Remdesivir even before they hear back on the clinical trial. They are ready to go today.

Its possible they don't end up profiting from the drug much long term. But that doesn't matter. Why?

Picture this. If the drug works, literally every publisher in the world's headline the next day will be: Gilead cures Covid-19 - Remdesivir saves the world

I dont give a flying fuck if they don't get paid a single penny from any treatment ever because I think its impossible for your stock not to see a bump with the announcement. And for all those who are gonna mention that Chinese biotech company that supposedly already made a Remdesivir copy, please save your breath. Nobody wants that shitty offbrand 97% purity version from a tiny biotech company that probably can't mass produce the drug yet and hasn't tested it on anything. On the other hand, Gilead is ready to go, tested, ideally soon to be approved, with stockpiles ready to be shipped. Pure 100% American made baby.

Do with this info what you will and at your own risk, I'm giving no recommendations here only info.

Zillow also provides seller leads for users of its Premier Agent program and brokerage partners. Real estate agents can also purchase advertising with Zillow. Real estate agents will pay Zillow based on the number of ad impressions delivered to users. Mortgage lenders pay Zillow based on cost per click. Seems like a good business model and Zillow could become the AMZN of the real estate game if they can follow through on this.

Nvidia needs chips from China and Apple the iPhones. All the factories are standing still and supply chains are fucked. And people here are frustrated by this ""irrational sell off"" and ""dumb people panicking"".

I got some losses for being in the wrong at some points, but being this oblivious and naive out of pure greed is something else. What do you expect? Powell printing iPhones? Trump making it illegal to close Chinese factories? AMD just saying ""Oh well, we can produce servers without these rare earths from China. Just use steel or whatever.""

I feel bad for everyone that gets shat on by cirumstances we can not forsee like Airbus crashing its whole fleet or whatever, but not for those who got AAPL c3000 29/2.

And in another matter: Chinese culture is about lying. You lie to your boss, the boss lies to his boss and so on. Some Chinese cities grow their gdp by 200% each month because thats how the governor gets tendies from the guy above him. Its about good appearances, not about *being* good at something. If the mayor of Wuhan announces the real numbers to his boss he will get shot and replaced. And if that boss announces bad numbers he will get shot and replaced, because the guy above him fears for his life and money. And so on and so on. **Never** believe Chinese numbers. They are **all** fake."

>The promise of Canada’s potential will not be realized until governments can reach agreement around how climate policy considerations will be addressed in the context of future responsible energy sector development. Without clarity on this critical question, the situation that has faced Frontier will be faced by future projects and it will be very difficult to attract future investment, either domestic or foreign.

TECK.A was already down -9.62% on Friday, it's going to be a bloody Monday for a company that just withdrew their application for a $20bn project. Or the market could rally based on TECK avoiding a potentially long and drawn out investment project (since Canadian investment is totally fucked).

Every other day I will start accumulating volatility leaps 3 months out.

&#x200B;

I dont feel that if this shit continues FED would be eager to bail the economy out as this is substantial risk and the fact that they are limiting QE not QE says that they are concerned. If there was no concerns they would keep pumping until the elections.

&#x200B;

P.S. you may inverse me as I started to short market in October and I decided to flip to bull gang 2 weeks ago. The short decision at the bottom, the long decision at the top.

&#x200B;

Currently all my short dated calls are nearly 0 including MSFT, MDB, Apple etc.

&#x200B;

Play safe fellas, choose the side wisely.

&#x200B;

EDIT: inverse me if you like, thats proven profitable strategy."

One thesis I'm seeing is we could see a controlled recession (the vocabulary might not be 100% right but whatevs). China's aggressive response basically purges all high debt Chinese businesses that collapse with a lack of customers. How China's banks react to so many defaults is where things get complicated. 

Meanwhile, I think a lot of US businesses that are overexposed to China can realistically write off this quarter as a loss."

2020-02-23 23:24:55,LVXSIT,3,"I feel like there is a lot of FUD here and people are only imagining the worst case scenarios. This weekend hasn't had as much bad news as it could have, and frankly Thursday/Friday was a bit of an overreaction fueled by FUD. I expect a red open to the week but a trend back up to SPY 335+ by Friday based on these predictions:

1) More Italian cases. This sounds bad, but better survivability and surveillance due to this being in the rich world means this will be short lived. I'm predicting good news surrounding the slow spread and proper containment. Italy will be a model and show the West that containment is possible. 

2) Word from central banks about how they will prop markets. I would guess that world leaders aren't just sitting around at G20 right now, discussing how they plan to stand by and let markets crash along with their political careers. I foresee bullish moves that prevent any bigly red days. It might not happen this week, but definitely in the coming weeks based on comments from the likes of Mnuchin. 

3) News from the many expedited clinical trials going on in China. Some cocktail of antivirals could work for controlling infection, but that remains to be seen. I predict positive news regarding drugs being used off-label to effectively suppress symptoms (pneumonia, cough, fever) and increase survival. When you can stabilize patients and send them home, it bodes well. 

4) More preclinical vaccine data. Basic scientific research in the vaccine field is underfunded since vaccine aren't as profitable due to their low cost. But when money starts pouring in, the field can work very fast. We have already seen good news with the development of DNA vaccines (very easy to manufacture for cheap) and protein subunit vaccines. They've gotten these in to mice quickly, and data should start pouring out from labs. This will put some light at the end of the tunnel.

TL;DR: People are freaking out about a virus that is being combatted heavily using modern and sophisticated tools - disease surveillance, economic policy, medicine, and science. When there is no news, don't assume that is bad news. The wheels are turning."

Austria 1 hour ago stopped a train coming from Italy suspecting that 2 people were carrying this virus. However, this suspect arises now just because yesterday there were the first reports of multiple outbreaks across northern Italy. This means that in the past weeks multiple people were already infected and traveling across Europe.


Plus they don't even know who started these outbreaks and just now there are the first cases reported from Milan, the financial capital of Italy with 3 million inhabitants. This week all schools will be closed in northern italy and most of public events will be canceled. Expect something similar likely happening in multiple places in Europe.


This is bad for worldwide economy in the short term, there is no other way to put it. Btw mods are gay and infected."
