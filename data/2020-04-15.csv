Those that held are now at a possible $40-50 loss per millions of contracts is a huge fuck up if they don‚Äôt cover and ride it out they will zero down. If some zero and come cover we go into another pump and dump it took hrs to reach resistance then got smashed back to earth when they shorted @28 and closed out for about $15-20for that small bridge. Once those shorts were confirmed the volume drops out they close shorts we bounce again. Then JPOW does rest  the making sure he forces short sellers to buy more or sell out he is very much winning. Both cause this current issue likely shorting as hard as their gay bear hearts can. JPOW just keeps coming until he is gets exhausted maybe after the elections

Maybe movie theaters or something? Maybe TSLA can shoot up to 800 or 900 off that? But premiums are just insane to buy in there and just had a massive rally.

As expected, in these transmission pairs, in addition to the simple clearly presymptomatic transmission, there are a couple examples of cases where the person who did the infecting became symptomatic **after** the person they infected became symptomatic (red dot after blue dot) (And no, I was not able to tell with a quick read how they determined the direction of transmission in those cases, but I guess I trust them?)."

2020-04-16 05:02:37,ChiquitaDominguez,7,"**Tesla‚Äôs battery pack strategy is very similar to its Autopilot strategy. It is all about vertical integration, software and fleet learning.** Tesla‚Äôs pack costs benefit from a lean and high tech design as well as from the high volumetric energy density of its cells, but also because it has shifted cell/pack hardware complexity into better (likely neural net based) software. The Munro teardown found Model 3 pack cost at $30/kWh, half of the $60/kWh in the Chevy Bolt, despite Model 3 pack‚Äôs ability to use higher energy density cathode chemistries and much simpler and cheaper battery cell designs.  


Tesla is the only automaker that can continuously collect data from its customer fleet, it is also the only automaker that has designed its own software, semiconductors and other pack components in-house (normally these are outsourced to multiple suppliers). For the battery it can collect information on driving style, charging, battery temperature, battery capacity changes, voltage, degradation etc. This statistical data is fed into Tesla‚Äôs BMS to precisely manage tiny differences in each cylindrical cell‚Äôs performances and provide equilibrium for the overall system. Tesla‚Äôs BMS software use multiple in-house designed ASIC chips called batman and robin for cell balancing. I think it is highly likely Tesla‚Äôs BMS is neural net based with data fed into a neural net to optimize management and balancing across the 4,000+ cells.  


**The BMS software delivers**:  


* High useable capacity of the battery cells.
* High and safe charge rates.
* High safety despite the less stable high energy density chemistry. (The software limits flammability risks - it ensures temperature is not allowed to rise and prevents metals deposits forming)
* High safety despite simplified cells without in-built safety features.
* Limited degradation and long life (in miles) of Tesla‚Äôs batteries relative to the competition. This benefits from Tesla‚Äôs precise cell balancing.
* Resilience to a certain failure/error rate of cells (many competitor‚Äôs designs require perfection to operate safely or at all).

Together with the better software, Tesla limits (as far as we know eliminates) the dangers of high Nickel cathodes by using pack materials with low heat conductivity and using inbuilt thermometers.  


Moving so much of the cell/pack tech/management into software rather than hardware means Tesla can use the same hardware designs for multiple different products - semi/storage/performance cars/pickup/Model 3 etc, giving better economies of scale."

Based on my own re\[TA\]rd(tm) method, I see few things based on today's price action. First, a bearish signal of a descending triangle from the 15 minute candles continuing today's slow downtrend including AH trading. Second, 2/3 point of that triangle lines up around market open so maybe can see the breakout downwards around that time with the 275 support becoming a resistance trendline. See the trading area being around 268 - 272 tomorrow possibly unless we see a serious break trough 268 with confirmatory RSI, MACD, and conviction via volume which are the basic indicators I know how to use lol. NFA.

TL;DR gay bear triangle from today. Probably wrong."

RSI can't measure how far we leaped after the recession; and most of it was sustainable.

But Trump is Trump. He's a wild horse that always spits out the bit. He trusts his gut; and his gut was convinced that reelection was dependent on the market. So Trump passed tax cuts and lowered the corporate tax rate which resulted in buybacks and massive wealth transfer/concentration. Middle class didn't get shit and most of us weren't impressed. So Trump promised more. He started a trade war with China, and lost. He got impeached, and lost.

Trump ain't bright. But even he knew that three strikes means you're out. But here he was -- still at the plate, winning.

So he beat up the Fed to drop rates twice from 2.25 to 0.25%. Because low interest rates mean more borrowing and greater economic growth. It was a perfect recipe that wasn't. Because no one was buying, prices crept lower, and Trump kept ignoring all the evidence.

This has nothing to do with a virus and the market will only get worse over time -- vaccine be damned. I said it before and I'll say it again, this is a liquidity trap. Bears rule the world through 2022 at the earliest. We have a moron at the wheel."

In which case Trump will still be able brag about  how much worse deep shit we could be in if it weren‚Äôt for him. At the very very very best, we will still be on life support at that juncture,  like we are now, EXCEPT most people will all be in agreement about, save a few diehard boomers like that Bitch who got fired from fox for saying Wuhan virus was a plot to overthrow Trump. (Call me crazy, but I wouldn‚Äôt be fucking surprised) In any case, we all will all know how much worse it will get before it gets better by that time. Trump will probably pivot to: ‚ÄúImagine if demented Joe were at the helm. Then we‚Äôd really be fucked!‚Äù

And he might be right. But the more I think about it, when I see how all these ABSOLUTE FUCKING RETARDS, here on wall street bets are doubling there money by yoloing there life savings  on a whim, like a fucking millennial licking an ICU toilet seat in NYC, I could actually see how in some ridiculous parallel universe, Joe Biden could actually be the unlikely retard to weather us through, into greener pastures.

But even though Biden will be handed the presidency on a silver platter Trump will still beat Biden, even when any halfway competent incumbent like a Governor Cuomo, would  have a halfway decent chance of beating Trump.

2020-04-16 00:15:46,Jackismyson,-1,"I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya cheap.

Entire sectors of the economy are at a standstill.

U.S. manufacturing output posts largest drop since 1946..but hey,, there's nothing wrong! We saw the bottom in March & not going anywhere near it again...oh, & I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya cheap...of course you can't drive over it cause of lockdown & deaths..

Americans don't leave home to shop in retail stores unless they are almost out of food. Spring break travel plans were cancelled. No one is commuting and purchasing gasoline for travel and commutes. As a result, car repair shops have no work. Entire cities that rely on tourism are in serious trouble. Pick out any tourism-driven, retail, travel related, hospitality, or food-service section of the economy, and you will find vast wastelands of inactivity
You don't think trickle down ever worked? Well, hello! these things trickle through the entire U.S. economy. Spring concerts, conferences, trade shows, sporting events, all cancelled.
March madness- cancelled. NBA- cancelled. Trickle, trickle, the bars that would have hosted March Madness parties - empty. Trickle, trickle, the food sales & pennents & hats & whatever at the NBA stadiums- gone!

Airline capacity is down an estimated 96% according to recent sources Airlines and TSA report 96% drop in air travel. The Las Vegas strip neon lights have been dark since the end of March. The gaming industry is completely closed. I have a longtime friend that is part of the WPT & plays in the World Poker Tour. She is goin gnuts. Now luckily for her she has won plenty over the years & has invested a lot of it, and took my advise on Feb 21 & moved to all cash, so didn't lose a chip. But hell,, take her loss of income & multiply it by all the players, all those that service the casinos, all the food venues, all the comedians, singers, musicians etc who are not working. How about those that made so much of their income across America off tips,, that doesn't get replaced at all by unemployment. In just two weeks from March 7 to March 24 this year, Nevada has experienced a surge in initial unemployment claims equal to what took almost a year to reach at the start of the 2007-2009 recession. Last month, Nevada saw an increase in initial claims to 58,798. It took from November 2007 to December 2008 to reach that same level during the last crisis.

Unemployment is throwing millions of Americans into financial hardship to the point of not being able to meet basic living expenses. From March to April, there was a 15% decline in the number of household able to make rent payments for the month. In data collected by the National Multi-Family Housing Council (NMHC Rent Payment Tracker), only 69% of apartment households paid rent for the month, down from 81% in March and 82% in April.

The $2.3 Trillion from the CARES Act increases government spending by $2.3 Trillion. Total nominal GDP for the U.S. in 2019 was $21.44 Trillion. So let's call it 11%, leaving 89% of GPD. And let's say 20% (probably WAY too high) is still producing. So 70% (cause I like rounding the numbers) of GDP producing industries are in a complete lock down.

We saw the bottom is in our rear-view mirrors & not going anywhere near it again??...remember that bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya cheap??...of course you can't drive over it cause of lockdown & deaths..

2020-04-16 00:13:32,trump_sucks_we_know,9,"Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout...

This is a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap). There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to create time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled.

Welcome to the **debt bubble**!"

""How the Government Pulls Coronavirus Relief Money Out of Thin Air""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/government-pulls-coronavirus-relief-money-190301335.html

Also, not sure if it's been mentioned but we're almost at 2500 deaths on the day and these past 2 days have been the worst by far. As i've said before, we're probably going to see an increased number of daily deaths until we're at 3000+ in a day, and then it will slowly decline from there. The deaths we're seeing now were from cases that were reported 2 weeks ago so they lag behind the daily number of cases, which is still very high right now. This narrative they're pushing of how we're passed the curve only applies to New York and a handful of other states. These increasing daily deaths are happening in most states in the country, so I don't think any more than a handful of governors of small states will open. The rest will wait until at least June, and by then we'll only have a limited opening in most states. This will probably be the storyline all weekend and next week and it will probably just lead to more fear and panic selling."

It'd be quite the timeline if the CCP gets fucked this year. If those lab conspiracy rumors are true, G-fucking-G. Every country would go against China. JP and TW in the region is pissed at the way China handled it. JP is paying companies to move out of China. The Asian countries will be the first to hate on China. There's a small amount (albeit growing) of educated middle-class Chinese citizens who already hate the CCP, so I can only imagine that the distrust will grow.

Western PC countries will take a while to clamp down on China. Hating on the CCP isn't the same as hating the people of a country. They need to have China take full responsibility for that shit. 

The biggest downside I can see happening is the animus against Asian Americans or Asians living in Western societies. That'll suck."
