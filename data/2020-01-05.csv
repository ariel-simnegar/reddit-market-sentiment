2020-01-06 10:41:22,,14,"ok hear me out u retards. what if options were actually supposed to be used as a hedge and not a way to gamble your money? and the large purchases of options you see are made by funds to hedge and not gamble. ok following me so far? those unusual call option activities you saw leading up to the 3rd of January, especially Jan. 2nd, were hedges, not gambles. what does this mean? it means large funds were already in the process of buying preemptive hedges in order to short stocks. remember those large amounts of 300/305/310 AAPL calls, and 50/51/52 AMD calls? those were hedges in preparation for a massive short movement in AAPL and AMD. those werent gambles in hopes the stocks would move up, which it could, but then they'd just profit. those call options were preemptive hedges to start shorting these stocks. the massive spike up during the last hour of trading on Jan. 2nd wasnt random. It might've been funds trying to buy the stock because there was a large request to short it, so they bought it so they could lend it out. now this shit may sound like a bunch of baloney, but i would bet that we do not see any recovery soon until mid jan at the earliest. there is no positive news until then which they could release to pump the market. china trade deal is set, and can only backfire if china backs out, the positives are already priced in. earnings doesnt start till mid-late january, so stocks will continue sliding down until then

I dont for one second think this means the end of the bubble, and neither should you (I'm looking at you, bear privates).

This market shrugs off fuckin everything. Bad economic data and guidance. The fact that this is only multiple expansion, the fact that the fed is stepping in for ""Not QE"". Election uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty. Nothing matters.

None of it matters. What does matter, you may ask???  

THE FUCKIN OPTIONS MARKET CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO PRICE WEEKLY MOVES APPROPRIATELY. For fucking weeks every trading session lies within the premiums. The Algos are dictating everything. And traders fucking know it. Its fucking retarded, and hasn't happend to this extent literally EVER.
