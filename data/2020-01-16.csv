i.e. If you have 1k in an account and buy 10 contracts for $100 dollars each w/ a strike price of $50 (thus leaving no more money in your account). What happens if on expiration the underlying's price is $100? Technically you just made a trade that has $50,000 profit but have no money to actually exercise the options on expiration.

=== =====

I'm having a hard time figuring out who is in charge at Wells Fargo's ""Wealth and Investment Management division"". They seem to be shuffling people around like a frenetic game of musical chairs.

There was a guy named Jay Welker, but he somehow got MeToo'd into retirement because some women complained. Then there was a guy named Dean Junkans, but he, too, retired.

That left us with David Kowach, running ""WELLS FARGO ADVISORS"" with 1.6T or 1.9T in AUM. But then I hear that he is also gone, moved over to ""community banking"" instead and leaving a guy named JIM HAYS in charge. To top it all off there are CIO types named Erik Davidson and Jonathan Weiss, and god only knows what they do.

Can someone provide me with an up-to-date Org Chart for those guys? And also while you're at it, esplain to me the difference between a ""wirehouse"" and a private bank.

OK, thanks."

At this rate we should end the year up 48% give or take 5%.
