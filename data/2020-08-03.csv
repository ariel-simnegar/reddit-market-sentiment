China Daily, another state-backed publication, highlighted these comments as being ‚Äútantamount to inviting potential US purchasers to participate in an officially sanctioned ‚Äòsteal‚Äô of Chinese technology.‚Äù

Chinese state media labeled the U.S. a ‚Äúrogue country‚Äù and dubbed the potential sale of social media firm TikTok to Microsoft as ‚Äútheft,‚Äù adding that Beijing could retaliate if a deal is sealed. 

Commenting on the matter, President Donald Trump said that buying only part of the app will be ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù‚Äî but he still gave Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella the go ahead. Trump added that some ‚Äúkey money‚Äù would have to be paid to the U.S. Treasury Department for making the deal possible. 

Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, called the move an ‚Äúopen robbery‚Äù and said ‚ÄúPresident Trump is turning the once great America into a rogue country.‚Äù

2020-08-04 08:31:13,spxputs,16,">I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...

>The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance

Carl Sagan literally predicted 2020 25 years ago. Everything about this quote is spot on...power of big tech, people obsessed with horoscopes and crystals, fake news, anti-science attitudes, 10 second sound bites aka TikTok. Amazing."

Mycelium has no fixed body plan so when it comes to a split in the road it just goes both ways at once and then splits at the next and then the next and then the next until it reaches the reward and then it strengthens the connection from the reward while severing the wrong paths. Sort of like how neuroconnections start off with more than is necessary and then as you mature you lose ones that contribute noise to important signalling pathways.

tldr: mycelium is cool

2020-08-04 04:16:28,glov,7,"Bought a couple $5 8/21 calls for PBI last week @ $0.05, sold today @ $1.30. Literally based my call off the fact that their earnings were coming up at -0.01 and I figured if they just have a penny or two higher they'll be 200% earnings beat and the bots would snatch it up thinking it's mooning. Ended up with 0.04 earnings for a 500% surprise, tendies ensue.

Not sure if I just got lucky or there's any kind of logic to this, but I've decided to buy calls in all the companies (besides the energy and real estate) that are reporting earnings this week with an expected earning of -0.02 - 0.01 to capture those who beat by a penny or so. What could go wrong?

EDIT:

Here's the tickers with earnings this week that are estimated between -0.02 - 0.01 EPS:

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck those 2% savings accounts. Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working. But at least you would have tried, which is more than most.

And it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to

And I get real frustrated

And I'm like, Pandemic ya know

And I'm like, just time it right

And it doesn't work out the way I wanted to

It's like, I concentrate real hard on the economy, but it doesnt work out

And everything I do and everything I try it never turns out

It's like, - 32% GDP, i just need time to let this play out

There's always someone there going,

'Hey, MikeYou know, we've been noticing

You've been buying a lot of puts lately'You know, you should, maybe, buy some calls

And like, maybe you should hedge,

Jpows printing money

And I go, 'No, it's okay, you know GDP -32%, unemployment all time highs

Just leave me alone I'll figure it out

You know I'll just work it out myself'

And they go, 'Well you know AAPL all time highs too

I'll be here you know and you'll probably feel a lot better if you just buy calls

Jpow has a huge toolbox, so why don't you talk about it'

I go, No, I don't want to I'm okay, invariation separaion is right'

The fact the market isn't making the fed and congress pay for dragging their feet on stimulus is shocking to me. 

I rode the wave, and it looks like I'll miss out on more gains, but if they make us wait until Friday for another stimulus package there will be pain this week. 

3rd time in 3 weeks QQQ has tested 270 and hit the brakes. We'll have a down day before the stimulus is passed, and once it passes we'll have ATH on SPX within 2 weeks.

So, with this MSFT news, you got FSLY being looked at by investors as well. FSLY earns income per data used, not a flat rate. COVID has been good to them. This may be too. 

>Majek also notes that ByteDance/TikTok is one of the largest customers for the content-delivery network Fastly (FSLY), and that growth in usage in recent weeks and months should be a boost to Fastly's second-quarter results. ""If a potential acquisition falls through and TikTok ends up being banned in the United States, it would present a near-term headwind for Fastly,"" he writes.

Of course nothing matters until 9:29 but as of right now your calls/puts are probably fucked.

He is also a degenerate but for some reason all his friends do is short gold (yes they are Asian).  He never gave into buying calls and kept trying to short different stuff with crazy positions that I would never have the guts to do.  He came out down in the end.

Anyways - my question is:  Is there any way to gift long dated options (calls) to friends?  That just wouldnt work right?  

It would probably be better to keep it in my own account and call it his?"
