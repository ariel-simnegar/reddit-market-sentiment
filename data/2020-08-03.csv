China Daily, another state-backed publication, highlighted these comments as being ‚Äútantamount to inviting potential US purchasers to participate in an officially sanctioned ‚Äòsteal‚Äô of Chinese technology.‚Äù

Chinese state media labeled the U.S. a ‚Äúrogue country‚Äù and dubbed the potential sale of social media firm TikTok to Microsoft as ‚Äútheft,‚Äù adding that Beijing could retaliate if a deal is sealed. 

Commenting on the matter, President Donald Trump said that buying only part of the app will be ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù‚Äî but he still gave Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella the go ahead. Trump added that some ‚Äúkey money‚Äù would have to be paid to the U.S. Treasury Department for making the deal possible. 

Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, called the move an ‚Äúopen robbery‚Äù and said ‚ÄúPresident Trump is turning the once great America into a rogue country.‚Äù
