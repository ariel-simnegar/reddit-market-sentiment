Walmart Joins Microsoft's Pursuit of TikTok -- Update

8/28/20, 1:24 AM
Walmart Inc. said it is joining Microsoft Corp.'s pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, throwing a curveball into the chase for the popular short video- sharing app.

The Trump administration has pushed TikTok's owner, Chinese technology giant ByteDance Ltd., to sell its American operations after targeting the app over national-security concerns.

Microsoft's bid is considered the front-runner, according to people familiar with the matter, while a second consortium including Oracle Corp. also remains in the running."

If it weren't for me discovering you retards earlier this year and tagging along on some of your adventures my parents' cat wouldn't be with them right now. I'm up nearly 300% over the summer on my initial ""investment"" so I was able to cut them a 1k check without thinking about it and their cat could get emergency surgery, saving its life. Yesterday she had to be taken to the vet with some bizarre intestinal blockage that turned life-threatening in a matter of hours but she's doing just fine now. She's a 3 year old domestic shorthair with a funny walk that we're pretty sure is residual from previous abusive owners, but she's in a very loving home right now where she's the only cat to get the attention. So thanks for all the laughs, gains, and losses. If you've been around all year, you've probably helped save a cat's life.  


PS RIP tanker gang, long live gun gang, bears you're right but you're way too early; Metal gang well good luck to all of us, but the SLV weeklies are truly moronic.

2020-08-28 05:20:35,DOESNT_BE_LIKE_IT_IS,12,"out of day trades and up on a call? sell a same exp call at a higher strike to lock in profits

ex.

buy aapl 500c on monday for 1.00 (505c going for .80)

Wednesday, apple is up a few bucks. so your 500c is now worth 2.50 and the 505c is going for $2.00.

you sell the 505c, and collect $200 in credit. (both on the same exp date)

since you only paid $100 for the 500c, you locked in a guaranteed $100 profit by selling the 505c. So now, if apple drops and both contracts expire worthless, you made $100 at least and the trade is 'risk' free now bc you recouped your $100 'investment' for the 500c

however, you also capped your gains on your open position by essentially turning it into a spread. Max gain on the spread is now $500; difference between the spreads...but PLUS the $100 you locked in by selling the 505c for 2.00 minus the $1.00 you paid for the original 500c. So now max gain is $600, ((200-100) + $500) with essentially no risk, other than if apple rips, your 500c would be worth a lot more than $600. so ur gains are capped

You could always also buy to close the 505c you sold to uncap your potential gains in the event apple drops and u think it'll go back up. So if u sold the 505c and collected 200 credit on Wednesday, then Thursday it's worth 80 again bc apple dropped, you can buy it back for 80 and then guaranteed profit would be (200-100) = +$100 - $80 = $20 and you'd be uncapped

these are not accurate contract prices

&#x200B;

Edit: works with puts too. Sell a lower strike put, same exp (own 80p, sell 70p)"

If you look at the stockwits page for the ticker, a decent amount of the comments are calling out the manipulation and posting screen shots of the consistent suspicious volume.

I took a deep dive into this topic on reddit, other forums and sources and found out that a lot of people have made their fortunes finding these stocks and playing the range, until the SEC catches onto whoever is doing it and stops it (normally after several years)

I have not been able to find a website that keeps track of suspicious range bound stocks. Probably for obvious reasons, why expose your golden goose to the wolves.

However, I would like to build a website that exposes these stocks, but my IT skills are dog shit. Need someone who can build an algo to identify them, then I'd verify them myself.

Hit me up if your interested, also don't care if you steal the idea, I'm more interested in the data then profiting off the website."

Seeing as the vast majority of Americans associate the stonk market with the economy, things are looking brighter for Trump's prospects. 

The democrats tried to paint themselves as caring for the people with their 3T Heroes act but they knew it would never pass the senate and stood their grounds on 2 - 3T so when the bill fails to pass, they could put the blame on Trump. However, the markets didn't give a fk because Trump just does the EO move and it is good enough for the markets. The markets are going to have to dip again if the Democrats want to secure the election. All Trump needs to do now just keep talking up the stonk market and how its recovered under his ""leadership"" and it will be a close race.  In short, volatility is gonna creep up as we get closer to the election so watch the timing of your calls and probably avoid trading the event itself."

Of course a polar bear came along, and my father, the giving man gave a little bit of Surstr√∂mming to the polar bear. But he became greedy demanding more. And with one fell swoop, my father swiped the polar bear away with a backhand made of oakenshield. The polar bear howled as he retreated. Lesson. My father was a giving man.

Here‚Äôs the quick breakdown for you: ORCL will lose the bidding war.. as will every other fucking company submitting a bid. Everyone submitting such a bid will pop and fade.. im personally riding those waves. They may last minutes, they may not even come.. but every wave I scalp will be reinvested into long term WMT calls and leaps. Now onto the good stuff.. MSFT and WMT have a combined market cap of $2,086,000,000,000.. that‚Äôs 2.08 TRILLION.. US.. MUTHA ..FUCKIN.. DOLLARS. That is 12 fucking zeros.. and if tendies are your preferred currency, that‚Äôs enough tendies to have fed all life from the Precambrian era to present day. Now back to Oracle.. because people think they actually have a shot..... let me put this out there, their total market cap is $175B. TOTAL! Their bid was $20B in stock and cash.. TikTok is said to be valued as much as $30B. Now although WMT is interested, they partnered up with MSFT, as they need to follow their own slogan of ‚Äúeveryday low prices‚Äù and split the tab with someone else.. guess why WMT popped today.. Their investors LOVE that slogan and splitting the bill on an acquisition is like a blue pill to their portfolios. Also, side note, WMT announced AH they‚Äôre selling off some online assets to add some more money to their bank. 
So what‚Äôs my move you ask, WMT Dec 150c. Why December? Because I‚Äôm not retarded and am interested in the WMT+ tendies this holiday season as well. I will additionally add leaps tomorrow. Good luck. Stay safe. And do your own DD before investing.

TLDR: WMT and MSFT TikTok Deal will happen, WMT to the moon. WMT Dec 150c"

**Context -**

The S&P 500 increased 0.2% on Thursday, closing at another record high and touching the 3500 level for the first time in the process. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.

Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.

From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.

Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.

Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).

As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.

Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.

2020-08-27 23:04:35,xesus2026,2,"I have to ask... Is anyone else starting to get shit scared?

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 2240 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

But these valuations for big tech seem insane. Dont get me wrong I dont expect AAPL or MSFT to go bankrupt any time soon but goddamn.

>After soaring 900% over the past 12 months, the automaker's valuation is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. Despite boasting a market capitalization that is closing in on $400 billion, the automaker's trailing-12-month free cash flow is less than $1 billion. Furthermore, while Tesla's vehicle deliveries are growing quickly and are likely to continue rising, the automaker is only expected to deliver 500,000 vehicles this year. Compare that to the approximately 2.5 million vehicles BMW sells annually, despite BMW's market cap being less than $40 billion.
