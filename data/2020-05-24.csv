>In 1945, Jim Miller returned home from the war and did not speak about it. He folded up his service uniform, medals still pinned to it, and put it in the basement, where his oldest boy sometimes took it out to play army.  
>  
>He did not speak about it to his wife, not for 64 years of marriage. He joined the fire department. He went to church on Sundays. He did not complain. ‚ÄúHe would say, ‚ÄòIt was not a good time. I‚Äôve had better times.‚Äô He did not embellish,‚Äù said his son.  
>  
>He was an old man when he began to tell his son what it was like to land on Omaha Beach on D-Day. The roar as he waited in a landing ship for the beach to clear. Then, a 24-hour blur. His son offered to take him back to Normandy, but the father said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there once.‚Äù  
>  
>Only once did Jim's children see him overcome with emotion about the war. In his 70s, he learned that there was such a thing as Holocaust denial. They had never seen him so angry. He dug out a box of photos and drove them to a local museum, adamant that they be displayed.  
>  
>They were photos of concentration camps. Corpses. Ovens. Bones. ‚ÄúHe wanted people to remember,‚Äù his son said. ‚ÄúHaving lived through all the physical issues, the psychological issues, if someone says it never happened, he was like, ‚ÄòOh my gosh, you folks. You have no idea.‚Äù  
>  
>James Miller died on March 30, at 96, having contracted coronavirus at the Holyoke Soldiers‚Äô Home. His photographs are part of the collection at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C.

2020-05-25 03:44:45,ButtFart88,2,"Alright it‚Äôs time we figure out where to go from here.

Virus is a nothingburger. CDC estimates it at around .4% mortality rate at the highest. Exclusively targets people who are already almost dead. Lockdowns actually do more harm than good, and it‚Äôs following typical flu season and should be completely gone by the end of June. Big money already has this completely figured out, anyone who‚Äôd like to keep denying this you are more than welcome to miss out on tendies.

We ended 295 last week and I think we could see 300 soon. The question is, will there be selling pressure? I don‚Äôt think there will. 

Remember, investors right now are fighting for the best deal. Most of them think we‚Äôll be back at $SPY 350 by the end of next year at the latest, so they‚Äôll all just fighting for the cheapest deals possible.

I think that we‚Äôll continue to see big money holding onto and only adding to their positions. This could possible cause us to reach $300 end of week and $310 end of month. It seems that every time an investor gets weak hands big money fights to swoop it up, I think this pattern will persist.

Currently cash gang right now but I may buy some calls end of day Monday on SPY. Seems safe. Either we end down and then rebound, or we end up and use that momentum to shoot up."

It is because the rest of the world is even more fucked. Japan is in its 4th lost decade. China was heading to recession before this from the largest credit build up in world history. Euro zone is on the verge of fracturing with a banking system that makes us during 2008 seem sane. Emerging markets is completely and utterly fucked for the next 10 years due to capital outflows, global trade shrinking before covid and many countries such as Mexico and Brazil were already in recession.

Basically the world is going to burn for the next 10 years and the us is the safest place to put your money. If you are going to short, you should short like London commerical RE or HK developers, not cash rich us large corporate or tech companies.

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

Ford vs. Tesla 

The Past is fighting for The Future. In 2020, Oil has crashed to unprecedented levels. Demand is halted to near zero as the world population reels from a painful virus infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. Many companies had just finished recovering from the damage of 2007-09 crisis. Not to mention the tariff talks and 2018 trade talks dump. Then a Trump Pump making a V recovery. Now as of writing it‚Äôs 5/24/2020. It‚Äôs raining as Tiger Woods plays with Peyton Manning against Phil Mck and Tom Brady in what feels like the only real sports in what feels like years but know its only been months. Being addicted to fantasy football has me withdrawn for the competition and drive for first. (I think tiger‚Äôs going to win because of home field advantage \[13th hole guess 7:11PM\]). I digress as you‚Äôre probably asking what this has to do with ford versus tesla. Well it‚Äôs a testament and challenge for the ruler of the American roads. The American heart lies within a big burly ford raptor truck. Which it‚Äôs sales and resale strength shows it‚Äôs the holo truck that every f150 owner hopes to be. Not to mention the only thing to challenge a raptor till the cybertruck was the srt10 dodge truck super bee. So why is the all-electric car wind up toy gimmick truck challenging these titans of engineering? Because it suppers on innovation into new markets. Telsa has shown with its sell-out after sellout of tesla offerings that its found the market for electric futurists. Ford, Chevy, and every other car company ignored them for years up until now. Ford is going to throw its most predigest hat into the circle with the Mustang Mach E. MME seems to me to be an amalgamation of all data and research ever done at ford and mixed into a bowl to make this 4 door fasthatchback all-electric all-wheel drive 0-60 sub 3.5 sec 300+ miles per charge, mustang‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt a keyword you could miss on that one. Except for the v8. The heart and soul that has driven America around for over 150+ years. Now Ford is saying it‚Äôs time for a change. Ford is betting its American Sports Car Coupe on this endeavor. See this is the big gamble that I think ford is betting on. I believe that Ford knows how desirable and undersupplied the market is for pure form all-electric fast vehicles. Ford will eliminate the time entry of individuals willing to make the switch today but are put on a waitlist instead. People in our day and age want things the next day (AKA Amazon). Any amount of time spent is time wasted mentally until the reward is introduced. Longer waitlists and wait times are causing concern and confusion among potential go greeners. So to sum it all up Ford being 5.65 is criminally low for the amount of history and being the first American big wig car company to put its chips in the pile. It‚Äôs only competition is the slow out the plant Tesla. Fords‚Äôs plan to flood the market could be one that works but many small side competitors are popping up all over so it remains to be seen if this new mustang heart will be the new heart for other vehicles as well. What would a ford electric truck look like? The bronco is taking a long time. What are the odds they‚Äôre looking at the cybertruck and wondering if they should make the bronco electric as well. IMHO that‚Äôd be sick and an untapped jeepish part of the market they could dominate in. (The weather is clearing up on the 16th and the score is nearly even)"

APPL because of the situation with China. If it escalates I think that they‚Äôll be in a lot of trouble. I also think that they need to innovate more and reduce prices. Ppl are already starting to stop upgrading to a new iPhone every year because there‚Äôs not much of a difference between each successive model, plus a grand each year is just too much for some ppl.

If it drops back to what you bought it for, even if that‚Äôs immediately, it‚Äôll just sell and you‚Äôll get your money back. If it does up, you can wait til it hits the limit sell or sell manually.
