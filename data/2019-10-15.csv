If a stock pays a dividend and has good value buy the shares and hold it collect the fat juicy dividend.

2019-10-16 05:28:18,PeanutButterRitzBits,6,"🐻 team. You are looking for 2 things (technically 3). EU (and UK despite no Brexit) CPI to miss. This will prime things. Then you need retail sales to miss right before market open. If this happens, which means the impossibly low standards of .3% growth off of last month's 0% were failed despite the fed's cuts, invalidating the deposit rate theories. 

If those things happen, the music stops. The fed budget that has been delayed two days is definitely *that bad*, so there is no recovery. 

If the sales meet, we continue floating and melting through earnings."

Will it ever stop? the drilling

To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a RED candle
Dance


Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way

You better hit bull's eye

2019-10-16 03:53:24,knotswag,8,"Wow I got my ass raped so bad today I forgot to do **Magical Crayons TA**.

After a flat and gay day yesterday, today we continued the momentum of Friday in a bullish direction. Despite today's bear-rape however, we're still trading below the topmost bullish range, which should be good news for the bulls or those that enjoy deep fried bear claws-- a continued run-up wouldn't be technically unsound. I would put the absolute topmost range of tomorrow at 303, with anything past that being a spot where buying a day-trade put could be profitable for a few quick tendies.

For my fellow bears, I'm sorry but there's no real good news. Barring any news-based movement, the trends point to continued upward trajectory. If insane news somehow does hit, there is a notable downward gap that would be filled to the 294 range, which is where you should watch for resistance. For those itching to grab more puts, the bright side is the maximal return of the near-term bull run is unlikely to exceed 305 without a technical correction of some kind-- small or large. So there may yet be spots of re-entry if your portfolio isn't aflame. However being theta, bull, or hibernation gang would be your best bet as its still bear hunting season right now."

What is your preferred way of using futures? They offer less leverage than options, but you get to trade nearly all day plus you don't have to deal with theta.

Do you primarily scalp them? Follow trends? Hold long overnight?

I've tried to scalp, but I find that it results in over-trading. Maybe I close out too early before theres much of a loss and I should hold longer.

Following a trend has worked pretty well for green days like today. I just buy near open and hold until I reach my target profit.

Now I'm seeing if longing overnight makes sense for index futures. Maybe set a max acceptable loss if things don't go the way I expect..."

Does the system always look for one user who is interested in selling me this exact spread with both legs. Or is it sophisticated enough to find two different buyers and sellers and match their asking price to open the spread I requested. Asking because I would like to understand the psychology of other side on how they would turn this into a profit. This would also clear up that price manipulation on the short leg.
