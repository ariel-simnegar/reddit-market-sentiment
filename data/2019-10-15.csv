If a stock pays a dividend and has good value buy the shares and hold it collect the fat juicy dividend.

2019-10-16 05:28:18,PeanutButterRitzBits,5,"🐻 team. You are looking for 2 things (technically 3). EU (and UK despite no Brexit) CPI to miss. This will prime things. Then you need retail sales to miss right before market open. If this happens, which means the impossibly low standards of .3% growth off of last month's 0% were failed despite the fed's cuts, invalidating the deposit rate theories. 

If those things happen, the music stops. The fed budget that has been delayed two days is definitely *that bad*, so there is no recovery. 

If the sales meet, we continue floating and melting through earnings."
