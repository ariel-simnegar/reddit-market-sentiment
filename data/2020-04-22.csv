>In the recent Phase 2 WILLOW study in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, brensocatib met its primary and a key secondary endpoint and demonstrated that its anti-inflammatory approach has the potential to treat the debilitating cycle of inflammation, infection, and lung damage.
Professor Chalmers continued, ‚ÄúThe mechanism of action of brensocatib observed in a study in bronchiectasis patients provides a strong rationale for evaluating this novel treatment candidate in other neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions. It is my hope that it will have applicability in patients at risk of ARDS‚Äîa devastating outcome of COVID-19 for which there are currently no approved therapies.‚Äù

**Man Not Sure Why He Thought Most Psychologically Taxing Situation Of His Life Would Be The Thing To Make Him Productive**

‚ÄúFor some reason I took a look at an economic catastrophe that may soon rival the Great Depression and said, ‚ÄòOh great, now I‚Äôll have the energy and the space I need to focus on my creative side.‚Äô But I guess living with ever-present, crushing uncertainty and the knowledge that people all around me are dying wasn‚Äôt the stimulus I needed after all.‚Äù At press time, Ayers had reportedly decided that, going forward, he would instead focus all his time and attention on feeling guilty about his lack of productivity.

The key is who is easier to trap, dump retail momo money/CTA who has caused this rally or bearish fundamental investors aghast at the disconnect between fundamentals and the market. I think its the latter. Fund flow data show dumb retail money chasing FANG stocks as well momentum CTA algos being the primary driver of this rally, while hedge funds and other traditional value investors have pulled back from this market. My argument is the CTAs and fomo investors are fluid and will turn on a dime, so they won't double down easily if the trend turns against them (especially the algos). Meanwhile if the market finally legs down, lots of hedge funds and fundamental based investors will reload their puts  or increase their short positions due to stronger conviction levels.

So as we finally break down technically, fundamental based investors will pile on the short which fuels the short squeeze rally to SPY330.

So buy 5/15 puts and 8/21 calls. Or inverse me or w/e and buy 5/15 calls and 8/21 puts."

Hear me out... MFA is a reit down about 80% from where it's been.  Swimming in debt, highly leveraged, 4 billion in liquidations in the few months.  Doesnt look good right?  Its valuation has tanked to reflect these solvency issues.  
HOWEVER, it has a 8% senior debt note maturing in 2042 that trades under the ticker MFO.  This is down only 20%  from it's high.  Granted, this gets priority in liquidation, but there should be an increased risk in the debt that should cause a loss of value.  
Basically what it looks like is the debt is trading like everything is fine while the underlying REIT has became a penny stock.  Seems like their should be a convergence play here... anyone know something I'm missing?"

2020-04-23 04:18:22,percussivePanda,11,"Real post here, forgive an attempt at rational thought. USO was trading at a 36% premium because retail investors were bagholding and the fund announced they would be restructuring their holdings (= increase in holdings value.). So, what was a trading value of 2.81 and an actual holdings value of 2.08 screamed overvalued, even given the intention to restructure. 


So anyway, the restructure has happened, and the holdings value increased from 2.08 to 2.31. The price also decreased, from 2.81 to 2.51.The premium has been essentially wiped out. 

USO has also stated intentions of continued restructuring -- as June and July contracts near maturation date and prices most likely dive, they will have likely moved into august and September, which has already started. They also move out of contracts before it gets too close to maturation date, to avoid volatility. -- When Mays contracts went negative, USO was not holding any of those contracts. It just also obviously tanked June's prices which sent the fund downward. 

So with the stated intention of restructuring to avoid contango, which while it looks to be ugly for a few months... The world still runs on oil and USO is not beholden to hold contracts in bad months. 

On top of all of that, their pending orders have favorable buy/sell prices -- they're selling for more than they're buying for right now. And lastly, on top of all of that, oil futures are up again tonight after rallying the previous 24 hours. 

What I'm saying with all of this is... It seems that an absolute moron who yolod into $1.00 calls, where the premium was exactly equal to the excess in share price to the strike price (ie, premium was $1.51, share price was 2.51, so every penny of movement in either direction was a dollar made/lost with no juice needed to cover premiums paid) could actually stand to win with a timely exit before reverse splits tangle the whole thing up on Monday."

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also buyers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike option trading truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a money tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé"

When people tell you Theta will kill you, this is what it look like. I made a mistake buying a SPY put without looking at the Greeks. As you can see by the numbers above.. For every dollar drop in the value of spy, I gain $0.3729 in the price of the option, but Theta takes 0.3704 from the option. Therefore, you don't see a lot of change in the price of the option unless it drops below the breakeven price. This is what happens when you buy on the money puts. Unless it does go down right away after you buy it, you are more likely to lose money."

(110) 6/19 SPY 310c bought at $26470

(6) 5/15 277p bought at $6132

I was wondering if I'm hedging in the most effective way? Tentative plan is to hedge with roughly 15-20% of my account value with ATM puts. Would it be better to just hold ATM puts 2 weeks out instead of 4? Would it be better to buy the puts a little further away from spot price? How quickly should I roll up or down the puts in terms of expiry? When would you want to roll up puts in terms of its strike price v spot price? Tentative plan was to roll them up every 5-7% increase from spot price v put's strike price. Should I modify that?

Is there a different strategy you'd recommend for someone whose bullish long term but wants adequate protection in case we get a few deep red days in between. Any and all advice would be appreciated!"

I've strived my whole life to be financially secure and am waiting for a dip in the housing market to purchase one I know I can afford. Purchasing a house is a privilege. 

I've always rented because I knew I was not ready for a purchase. I have saved money to prepare for if I was laid off for a year and could cover all my bills. That was my goal when I first got a job. It wasn't easy, I ate a lot of shitty meals and had a lot of roommates and drive a pos paid off car. If I don't make my rent I get evicted. That's how it works. That's how it has always worked. Why the fuck should the government reward those who don't give a shit and spend their entire paycheck every period for not saving? Why are we printing out money faster than possible? Why do we do bailouts? 


This will have consequences, maybe not now, not even this year, but it can't last. But by then, the dollars I have saved won't even help me."

2020-04-22 23:35:17,pron_site_operator,5,"If /ES trades below 2763 again (the bottom of this week's expected move) I think the market is going to accelerate to the downside as a sign of broad weakness and an end to this upward trend.  Bulls need to push past 2811 for this rally to keep going but backed off of it towards the end of the trading session.  We have been locked in a range for two weeks so I expect a break up or down will last for several weeks at least. Also, unlike other weeks I also think this week's unemployment numbers will break the market if we get all time high claims that should have happened in the initial phase of the shutdown."

2020-04-22 23:07:58,Cedric_T,5,"One weird trick to know if your trade will make money:

If your trade has a ‚ÄòP‚Äô after the number it means you will lose money. P stands for POOR which is what you will be after expiration.

If your trade has a ‚ÄòC‚Äô after the number it means you will make money. Wait, you ask, shouldn‚Äôt it be ‚ÄòR‚Äô then which stands for RICH? Yes, but when Lord Zeus created the Greeks he realized ‚ÄòR‚Äô looks too similar to ‚ÄòP‚Äô and might confuse the mortals so he made it ‚ÄòC‚Äô instead which stands for CLUCK-CLUCK-CLUCK meaning it will be raining tendies from Mount Olympus."

I'm sitting here looking at tech, particularly LRCX with their earnings after hours.

Looking from 2018 on by a quarterly basis, their revenue has been nothing but down quarter over quarter. The only reason their EPS continues to tick higher is because they buy back their stock and decrease share / float amount.

Their Free Cash Flow continues to deteriorate and go down...

They say demand is still strong in Asia, with nearly 1/3 of their revenues from China. You telling me they still working over there with their fake numbers?

2020-04-22 20:57:42,pron_site_operator,2,Volume across the market was well below average today as the markets floated up with barely any volatility.  Today I expected SPY to close the gap at 281.59 but came pretty close before pulling back and finding home at VWAP.  The market is effectively moving sideways now in a range for 2 weeks so the lower volume could account for indecision by traders.  I could see /ES testing 2882 due to light selling activity and catching a bid to the bewilderment of bear-ish traders.  I think if we break and hold above 2882 there won't be much of a bear case for a couple of months as the market continues to squeeze bears day in and day out.

Tomorrow will be green because 25+ million unemployed means nothing to shareholders, although not as green as today. Maybe ~1.25-1.5% EOD. Wildcard is Trump going off the walls retarded, which is a 20% chance daily (I‚Äôve done the math).

Friday will either open flat and cascade into a moderate red (-2%+), or open lightly red and stay flat, depending on how in touch with reality the markets are that day. 

Make no mistake, we are near the top. This is the part of the ride where we all get fucked. Don‚Äôt dance, think of non retarded plays and commit to them, otherwise you‚Äôll end up sad and tendieless."
