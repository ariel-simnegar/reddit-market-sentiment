>In the recent Phase 2 WILLOW study in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, brensocatib met its primary and a key secondary endpoint and demonstrated that its anti-inflammatory approach has the potential to treat the debilitating cycle of inflammation, infection, and lung damage.
Professor Chalmers continued, ‚ÄúThe mechanism of action of brensocatib observed in a study in bronchiectasis patients provides a strong rationale for evaluating this novel treatment candidate in other neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions. It is my hope that it will have applicability in patients at risk of ARDS‚Äîa devastating outcome of COVID-19 for which there are currently no approved therapies.‚Äù
