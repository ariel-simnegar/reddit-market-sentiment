2020-05-21 09:59:14,SolitaryEgg,7,"Listen up retards, because I've been hearing so much misinformation about this Chinese company delisting fiasco. And I gotta set it straight. 

A lot of bulls are saying that the SEC delisting Chinese companies is bullish, because people will take money out and reinvest into American companies.

It doesn't work that way. Investors aren't patriots. The rules are simple: literally anything that adds any uncertainty is bearish. Investors don't like having wealth tied up in uncertain equities. 

Companies being delisted? Uncertainty.

It also brings up this whole other issue of ""how did these Chinese companies get away with this?"" It indicates that the SEC wasn't really doing their due diligence, and they were allowing foreign companies to list their stock with random numbers. Does it mean a lot of companies are cooking the books? Maybe, maybe not. But, at the very least, it plants that seed of doubt in investors' minds.

This whole thing is likely why we are red right now, despite TA indicating a likely run up to 300. I do believe yesterday would've been a much bigger rally without this news. 

You never fucking know with the market, but a large sell-off today wouldn't surprise me. There is at least some sort of motivation for firms and retail investors to take cash until this thing plays out."
