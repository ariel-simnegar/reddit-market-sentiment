2020-05-21 09:59:14,SolitaryEgg,6,"Listen up retards, because I've been hearing so much misinformation about this Chinese company delisting fiasco. And I gotta set it straight. 

A lot of bulls are saying that the SEC delisting Chinese companies is bullish, because people will take money out and reinvest into American companies.

It doesn't work that way. Investors aren't patriots. The rules are simple: literally anything that adds any uncertainty is bearish. Investors don't like having wealth tied up in uncertain equities. 

Companies being delisted? Uncertainty.

It also brings up this whole other issue of ""how did these Chinese companies get away with this?"" It indicates that the SEC wasn't really doing their due diligence, and they were allowing foreign companies to list their stock with random numbers. Does it mean a lot of companies are cooking the books? Maybe, maybe not. But, at the very least, it plants that seed of doubt in investors' minds.

This whole thing is likely why we are red right now, despite TA indicating a likely run up to 300. I do believe yesterday would've been a much bigger rally without this news. 

You never fucking know with the market, but a large sell-off today wouldn't surprise me. There is at least some sort of motivation for firms and retail investors to take cash until this thing plays out."

I’ve done both and margin trading has been profitable for me from 3 straight months, whereas options trading, I can’t even make it out 2 straight weeks being green.

My margin trading strategy has been to buy stocks after a big pull back and average down as it turns more gay, then on a huge leg up, unload. Rinse and repeat.

Tried doing this with options, a 1-2% pull back on a stock absolutely obliterates the options.

Anyone else feel like margin is the better way to go?

2020-05-21 06:53:18,ChiquitaDominguez,5,"Here's my test. Do I get bothered by a stock's downward movement? If I do, I shouldn't be invested in it. For example, I'm a huge believer in Tesla long term. If Tesla goes down 50%, my first thought would be to buy more. Depending on certain factors, I may buy more or I may not. But that would be my initial reaction.

If your initial reaction to a significant downward movement would be to sell, you shouldn't be in the company. So ask yourself, if LK went to $1, would your initial reaction be to buy more? If so, go for it. If your initial reaction would be ""ah this was dumb"", then don't buy it.

This is why I'm not in BA or the airlines or the cruise lines or anything like that even though I recognize there's probably long-term asymmetric upside. Because I know I would've sold them if they started crashing and there was bankruptcy talk and all that."

MGM Resorts International is an American global hospitality and entertainment company operating destination resorts in Las Vegas, Detroit, Mississippi, Maryland, and New Jersey, including Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, and Park MGM. In January 2019 the company took over Empire City Casino in Yonkers, NY and also opened MGM National Harbor in Maryland and MGM Springfield in Massachusetts. The company has a majority interest in MGM China Holdings Limited, which owns the MGM Macau resort and casino, and is developing a gaming resort in Cotai. MGM Resorts owns 50 percent of CityCenter in Las Vegas, which features Aria Resort & Casino. It has a majority controlling interest in MGM Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust.

DraftKings is a gambling website.

2020-05-21 02:55:06,8BitsIsEnoughForMe,6,My pet theory is that we were over due for a mild recession that would have played out over the summer.  But the extreme stimulus with the virus is basically overwhelming whatever natural pullback there would have been.  The result is that the companies that should have been culled and the highly leveraged players can stay in the game.  Therefore future GDP growth will be poor because those resources won’t be allocated to more productive pursuits which is the natural consequences of such cycles in regular times.

China wants badly to resume the economic relationship it had with the United States, while having the U.S. accept its need to dominate first the South and East China seas and then the Pacific, while also projecting economic power and later military power globally. The United States is dominant in North America. It fought for control of the Pacific and the Atlantic in World War II. From China’s point of view, the geography of the Western Pacific and the ability of the U.S. to blockade China is an existential threat."

Why? Risk tolerance. How long will someone let it go before selling and buying back in. It got me thinking...If there is no pullback like we’ve been doing in the last month, and nothing improves (unemployment, virus, china, etc list goes on) then you actually create a scenario for a rug pull... like a domino effect. Trading a channel has avoided this, but say we hit spy 220 or so without pulling back, the first bit of worse news can exponentially affect the house of cards imo."

I'm 18 and my goal is to become rich af and retire young so that don't have to be a fucking wagecuck and can actually do whatever I like.


I'll see you again, either on the moon or in the earth core.



This was [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6zen3/from_today_i_can_be_an_autist/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I made 90 days ago when I first got money on my TastyWorks account, today I received a RemindMe bot message made by myself asking: ""how u doing boi?""


That's how I'm doing:





Not good lost 50% (of 2000$, bc i convinced my parents to put more money in, and was hyped af to make some money) on retarded SPY puts bc of fomo after the market already dropped, got hooked in with diamond hands and lost money, mostly to IV crush, only satisfaction was my GME puts that i lost hope on bc they were basically worthless and then they went ITM for a day like 2DTE and cashed out, still lost money on that one.

Ironic that i made a post on WSB about selling options now that IV is so high and the market dropped.

Not gonna lie seeing all these people becoming rich made my mouth water and thats how i got some fomo, but; i dont want to sound like I'm making excuses or taking fake merits, I knew the market would crash, I live in Italy and the first day that a news came out about the first coronavirus patient in Italy I knew it was gonna be big and the market would get rekt, the Italian one so EWI puts not SPY but still, I was sitting at a restaurant with my father and he told me this news, and I said to YOLO all our money on puts bc its was almost sure the make money, and I meant it, but he wouldn't listen, he didn't even know what I was talking about, plus ALL our money on a BET? no.
But that one wouldn't have been a gamble, it was a very good kind of high probability speculation that would have had magnificent gains.
But I let it slip, my fault for not pushing harder for it, then we had problems charging the account, so I just let it go and came back 2 weeks later with all that FOMO to ruin my account.

But it was a very valuable lesson on not being retarded, and luckily ""only"" approx 1100$ that I lost, now i actually started educating myself about stocks, options and investing more seriously, but i now know to not be such a brainlet and hope to do good in the future."

Making sure to send good vibes, and to reinforce the DIS stock. I can make sure to include a chant for you (your username). I will make sure to send out a general blessing of wealth to all my fellow fag traders. 

I have a **Gold Tigers Eye** that is meant to attract wealth, and it is considered the universal ""luck stone"" (I'm not fucking sure why lol), but it will be set out for anyone who needs it.

Combined with the power of my **Red Jasper or The Stone of Warriors** which is used for protection and fortification, it is said to repel negative energy.  Along with my Malachite which will reinforce the protection brought in by the Gold Tigers Eye, it is apparently the most important stone for protection against negative energies. 

Lastly, **Selenite**, it stimulates one to move forward, (stock moving up if you're retarded) this will moon by the power of the moon and the Seven Sages. 

If anyone wants a blessing tonight, reply to my comment saying ""I'm a faggot retard, and I want to be blessed"". 

Ya'll have been looking to a gecko for assistance? Gordon is old news.  Look up, that's where you needed to be staring this whole time, its been right there for so long. Believe in the power of the moon.

AGAIN IF ANYONE WANTS A BLESSING BECAUSE THEY MAKE FUCKING POOR DECISIONS WITH MONEY, I GOT YOU, JUST LET ME KNOW YOU'RE A FAGGOT RETARD WHO MAKES MAD CHOICES. 

STAY BLESSED EVERYONE."

Summer 2019 I made 20K shorting cannabis stocks. Fall 2019 my 20K fell harder than the leaves off the trees in Canada.
In fact, got so emotional I injected another 10K and lost that too. 
Only new to reddit within the past couple months and haven’t posted much so don’t have screenshots. 

But fast forward to January and I tried to kill myself due to external factors (in addition to the $30K loss). 
Internet stranger somehow fuckin called my parents and saved me. 

Got my $2000cad CERB in my bank account and YOLO’d it up to $8000cad. 
#HolyShitEverybodyElseIsRetardedAndImAGenius. 
Continued to YOLO and turned it into $5. 
- New suicidal feels. 

Injected $100 more and turned that $105 to $2800. 
Today just lost $200. 


Wanna know what’s interesting tho? 
I made my $20K while sober away from smoking weed and drinking and whatnot. 
I lost my $20K when I relapsed on my substance abuse and lost a good friend. 

I turned that $105 to $2800 while I was spending a week sober, then today lost the $200 during a relapse (ending total $2600 [yes, I am rounding]). 

I may be retarded. 
I may be very fucking retarded. 
But at least I am self aware of my destructive behaviours. 

Now I vow to only make small trades for the next 31 days. 
If I haven’t sobered up by that time I will cease trading entirely until I can pass a drug test. 

I’m bringing everyone in on this to hold me accountable for my actions. 
My substance abuse is manifesting into a newfound gambling addiction. I’ve been an addict all my life this isn’t my first rodeo, so it’s time to set the ground rules instead of YOLOing $2000 on EOD Spy Puts at market open lmao"

The Conservative approach on revenue increase would be half that, $15 billion or 21%.

Because we can't anymore call this ""fake bounce"" and shit. This has went from 220 to 300 now and almost all the bad worse worst possible news events are already over. At this point, shorting this is just suicidal as a huge ass FOMO cash rush is incoming to ""cAtcH tHe RaLLy"" and that would probably take us to 310 levels. So the question is when the economy actually restarts and Fed pulls the pause button, would that trigger a sell the news type of event and a big dip comes ?

Edit: the reason I’m thinking boom in used cars is bc many ppl will be using cars who didn’t before as a form of PPE for their commute. Also with the amount of unemployed, and uncertainty etc, I imagine many would rather but cheap maybe even temp cars and possibly even in cash. I’d imagine that everyone will be giving great incentives with interest rates as low as they are and other factors so I don’t think new cars will be much more enticing then usual"

Bear Case:


1. DeMark 13 signal on SPX,SPY, QQQ, & NDX

2. Lowest volume since Feb 20th

3. RSI overbought or near overbought on all time intervals above 1min on SPY

4. Lowest Put:Call ratio since Feb 20th

5. Fed minutes

6. China

7.  Long Holiday Weekend

8. Unemployment Numbers (lololol yeah right)

9. ???


Undetermined Case:

1. DIX 46.3% (down from 47.7% today) still technically bullish, but the correlation hasn’t been fully proven.

2. GEX 3,914,000,000

3. Bipartisan bill introduced in senate(not commenting on chance to pass, just saying it’s been introduced and has at least limited bipartisan support)

4. McConnell vowing to not renew unemployment+ benefits (bearish for individuals, possibly bullish on market sentiment)

5. TLT movement today (could be related to introduction of 20 year, but also could be due to market sentiment turning south)



Bull Case:

1. Fed (PPT and BRR)

2. Stonks only go up (FOMO)

3. Unemployment Numbers

4. Gordon ate like 3 worms.

5. Jerome Speech at 2:30

6. Vaccine news (again)

7. ???

I'm looking at selling the $292 puts (2920) and then buying the $291 puts or $290 puts (2900) for a nice put credit spread that should expire worthless in 2 days as we probably center between 292-296..

If I want to stay safe, I'll sell the $289 puts and buy $288 puts and let those expire in 2 days for free money as well.
