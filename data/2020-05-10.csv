You‚Äôd have to make at least $400 per trade every market day to make $100k in a year. 

Obviously, making 400 per trade for 250+ days is impossible. This creates unnecessary pressure on your mind.

So, to elevate daily pressure, if you can make at least $8333 a month, you‚Äôll reach $100k. It‚Äôs still a rather large number, but because there will be terrible days for you, by setting a goal of 8333, it elevates some pressure.

And this assuming you ONLY trade options as your job. The amount of cash you will have to make per day or per month will be less than 400 and 8333.

Nevertheless, I now have a goal of achieving 8333 a month. I many not reach that every month, or even at all, but at least I have goal to strive for.

I will remember those numbers 400 a day, 8333 a month."

2020-05-11 05:54:51,TheDolleyLlama,7,"Things I'm looking at this week: 

SLV: finally broke out of our triangle, looks like we're testing the gap. Likely seeing 15 EOW. SLV 6/19 15c for sure. 

IWM: Likely testing the gap again. Broke out of the middle of its channel, has room to run. Personally think IWM pulls the market up this week. This will have the greenest week if trend holds. Still a ton of catchup to do. Retest and hold at 130 = IWM 137/142c spreads. Probably my biggest play this week.

QQQ: Another run at the gap. If QQQ fills, IWM fill rapidly follow. If IWM runs to fill, QQQ likely will as well. Logic says correction to 220 for a retest, so I'm reserved, but if IWM takes off QQQ may be lifted by rising tides. QQQ 228/232c spreads if I see support at current prices.

SPY: Huge pivot point. Trend says 300, RSI says correction to 288. Probably not touching this week unless I get a golden short opportunity at 300 or long at 288. Too tricky. 

WTI: About to make a huge breakout, we'll likely know EOD. Personally think we're seeing 20 by Wednesday for a ton of reasons, but too soon to tell. 

VXX/VIX: Both at the bottom support of their respective channels. Both scream correction to upper level of channel. However, other charts look bullish, so this could get interesting. Watch VIX very closely at open, any break below and its VXX 27/25p spread all day.   


Keep in mind December Fed bonds went negative last week, and that Powell speaks on Wednesday to almost definitely address this. Anticipating an uptrend to price this in Monday."

Unemployment numbers are inflated because it just takes into count people who applied for unemployment, not necessarily who qualifies for it or ends up getting it. Personally know people making around $4,000 a month off of unemployment. Most these people are just raking in free government money till they go back to work sometime in August.

They even provided a update to guidance last month saying it was going down and government and university labs are all in on Covid and not other diseases.They do not have specific kits to deal with viruses as they deal with cells. There has been a lot of insider selling as we're approaching all time highs. I'm currently shorting 100 shares 8K worth for earnings, because they're going to miss BAD. I plan to roll them over to puts the day after earnings on Tuesday mid--day as the IV will be lower.

now, everyone is expecting a second rug pull. but thats probably unlikely to happen. firstly, VIX is still at 29, which is double normal levels. people are still expecting a second leg down. the fed is also actively intervening now. powell was caught with his pants down during the first rug pull, but now he has his shining iron armor on ready to fuck bears. the plunge protection team is also working around the clock now. its also election soon, and trump needs those stock numbers up. he practically controls mnuchin and powell, and can easily pump stocks up with his fucking covfefe tweets. the pump and dump happened in late january to february, where most big politicians and players with connections already got out. if this whole thing wasnt already planned out, the market wouldve collapsed in late january, when the virus was announced, rather than late february, where most politicians already dumped."

Mimecast is a specialist in email security, especially for Microsoft products. 

I could link a bunch of stuff on fundamentals suggesting it's undervalued and has good free cash flow, earnings growth etc., e.g. [1](https://simplywall.st/news/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-mimecast-limited-nasdaqmime-suggests-its-37-undervalued/), [2](http://archive.is/JN3YT), [3](http://archive.is/r4OM6).  

But the main point is its larger competitor Proofpoint just disappointed at earnings, and along with DBX/NET, this lead to Mimecast's stock drifting back down on Friday.  However, its solid fundamentals could position it well for an earnings surprise, plus [it is beating Proofpoint in search interest](https://i.imgur.com/PWqhodD.png), especially recently.  

It's possible Proofpoint unfairly blamed COVID19 for a poor quarter, when they simply were being outgrown by competitors like Mimecast.

There is also a [sharp, secular uptick in email security search interest](https://i.imgur.com/jJ03Klu.png) during COVID19

2020-05-11 00:30:19,kkkodaxerooo,0,"""Trade war""? China bans a ton of western apps and websites, just so that they can develop their own Chinese knockoffs and drive artificial growth, rather than innovate. Are Trump's trade war plans not just essentially a comparable sort of mechanism?

=== ==== ======

To bring a historical perspective in: the kinds of tariffs that Trump is proposing are ones that were overthrown post-WW2, after they were largely identified as being a significant cause of the wars. Those that championed, and eventually drove through the introduction of free trade legislation won the Nobel Peace Prize. Higher tariffs and the like just result in increasing friction and antagonism between countries, they don't tend to achieve anything of actual value to the citizens in the modern globalised economy.

It's also worth pointing out that the citizens of the USA are going to ultimately be the ones to suffer financially, if anything. China will to some degree, but unless everyone bands together across the globe, it won't be enough to actually change anything. Manufacturing won't return to the US, it'll be done by the next cheapest country. China will be making good money from the raw materials sales to those countries. We've got a long way to go until the US will ever be the 'next cheapest' (especially without access to the cheap raw materials from China), and even then the prices will be driven largely by the amount of automation that have been applied to the problem, so still negligible job growth.

That job growth is ultimately what Trump has been promising and using as the driving factor for his plans to put higher tariffs and the like on China. It's not going to work. Those glory days started dying some 50-60 years ago.

Historically the other approach the US has taken is also absurd and just hurts tax payers. Instead of raising tariffs, the US has settled on subsidising industries. That results in absurdities like how every job saved in the tire manufacturing industry by the recent subsidies costs taxpayers somewhere on the order of $200-250k a year.

The US could have employed them to sit on their butts and twiddle their thumbs, for less.

It could have spent the money on retraining the individuals who's jobs were saved, and been better off all round.

There are all sorts of products that the US produces and sells which are a net loss to taxpayers, or are only profitable as a direct result of those subsidies. That high fructose corn syrup you hear about is a prime example. No one else in the world produces it like the US does, nor uses it in their products. Why? Sugar, the superior and safer product, is cheaper.

High fructose corn syrup is only cheap in the US because of subsidies. I forget the specific figures, but the net result is something like for every 70c of it sold, the US government forks out around $1.

The whole approach to this needs a big rethink. Tariffs won't fix it. Subsidies won't fix it. Retraining seems like the most cost effective way to solve the problem, but of course the question is what do you retrain them to do? It also seems somewhat anathema to the US political perspective. It's not really an approach either of the main parties would promote. Both fall back to subsidies as the easiest way to solve the problem. Both do things like put earmarks in forcing the Army to buy tanks they don't need, just to prop up manufacturing in their states."
