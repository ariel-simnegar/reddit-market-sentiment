1. **$137.4b revenue in Q2**.  Amazon reported $88.9b revenue in Q2.  Apple $58.3b.  Microsoft reported $36.9b.  Netflix $6.05b.
2. **$6.48b in Net Income.**  Amazon $5.2b.  Apple $11.25b.  Microsoft $11.6b.  Netflix $720M.
3. **$378b Market Cap today.**  Amazon $1.65T.  Apple $2.00T.  Microsoft $1.59T.  Netflix $215.5B.

This company is so incredibly undervalued.  They are the highest revenue company in the US by nearly a 2-1 margin.  Amazon is #2.  They are growing their ecommerce platform faster than Amazon.  They have an incredible network of stores, logistics, suppliers, products, which will allow them to out-compete long term.

The whole case for tech in the pandemic is that they are ""pandemic-proof"", or ""recession-proof"".  Uh hello, WMT??  This is fucking WALMART.  If there's any company that should be classified a safe haven, it is WALMART.

Eventually y'all are gonna wake up on this stock and realize it should be up there with the classic tech giants towards $1T in value."

Understand that Vale mines the most and best quality nickel in the world in Canada and lesser quality nickel all over the world. Know that VALE stock is discounted compared to the other biggest miners in the world like BHP Biliton because of two tailings dam collapses in Brazil, one in 2015 and one in 2019.  They suspended the dividend in 2019, but have mostly paid the fees and expenses for the two accidents. They are also the largest producer of iron ore.  Their earnings estimate for the coming quarter is much higher than the last few quarters.  Long VALE shares for the adult portfolio"

This implies that there should be a negative correlation between gold prices and treasury yields, yet over the last week or so both gold and treasury yields have been moving in the same direction. What could explain the reason for this disparity? 

Could it be that people are choosing gold over US treasuries because of real yield falling as a result of inflation? If so, isn't this all the more reason to buy gold?"
