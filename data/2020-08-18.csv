1. **$137.4b revenue in Q2**.  Amazon reported $88.9b revenue in Q2.  Apple $58.3b.  Microsoft reported $36.9b.  Netflix $6.05b.
2. **$6.48b in Net Income.**  Amazon $5.2b.  Apple $11.25b.  Microsoft $11.6b.  Netflix $720M.
3. **$378b Market Cap today.**  Amazon $1.65T.  Apple $2.00T.  Microsoft $1.59T.  Netflix $215.5B.

This company is so incredibly undervalued.  They are the highest revenue company in the US by nearly a 2-1 margin.  Amazon is #2.  They are growing their ecommerce platform faster than Amazon.  They have an incredible network of stores, logistics, suppliers, products, which will allow them to out-compete long term.

The whole case for tech in the pandemic is that they are ""pandemic-proof"", or ""recession-proof"".  Uh hello, WMT??  This is fucking WALMART.  If there's any company that should be classified a safe haven, it is WALMART.

Eventually y'all are gonna wake up on this stock and realize it should be up there with the classic tech giants towards $1T in value."

Understand that Vale mines the most and best quality nickel in the world in Canada and lesser quality nickel all over the world. Know that VALE stock is discounted compared to the other biggest miners in the world like BHP Biliton because of two tailings dam collapses in Brazil, one in 2015 and one in 2019.  They suspended the dividend in 2019, but have mostly paid the fees and expenses for the two accidents. They are also the largest producer of iron ore.  Their earnings estimate for the coming quarter is much higher than the last few quarters.  Long VALE shares for the adult portfolio"

This implies that there should be a negative correlation between gold prices and treasury yields, yet over the last week or so both gold and treasury yields have been moving in the same direction. What could explain the reason for this disparity? 

Could it be that people are choosing gold over US treasuries because of real yield falling as a result of inflation? If so, isn't this all the more reason to buy gold?"

And yet we lurk in the shadows. Waiting for our day. We know it approaches. Soon you'll be buying a Kphone, not an iPhone. They'll wonder where it all changed. It changed with us. We are the Kboys. We will soon emerge from the K hole.

I approached him after the speaking event concluded to discuss my appreciation of his work and the incredible potential of the tech he's developing and electric cars and SpaceX in general. He was very rude and dismissive and seemed to only want to talk to my mom. I kept having to get his attention but he kept asking my mom if she wants to see his ""BFR"", whatever that means. Finally I got around to asking about taking a picture with him and of course he agreed, but only if my mom would be in the picture with us. By this point I was getting some seriously weird vibes from the dude, so I decided to stand between him and my mother for the picture. At the end of the countdown right when we said ""cheese!"", I felt a sharp pain in my side and yelped, ruining the picture. I pulled up my shirt to see what happened, and there was a tiny pin-sized hole in my side that was bleeding quite a bit. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but I swear Elon stabbed me with a syringe or something. He then complained loudly about how I ruined the pic and suggested we take another with him in the middle. At this point I just want to be done with this weirdo so I'm like whatever. So we line up again and I shit you not, the guy palms my mom's entire ass cheek and squeezes. Obviously my mom was extremely offended and forcefully removed his hand while walking away. This made Elon angry and he started yelling profanities at her. We both stormed out of there and my mom grounded me for having her go through something like that. The whole experience made me extremely disillusioned with the space and I decided to sell my TSLA calls at a loss"

2020-08-19 04:03:00,CptTonyStark,11,"With ppl shitposting about the NBA and anything being fair game, here's my analysis of my 🤡 situation.


I've been journalling a lot lately and it's interesting to see that with every passing year I've gotten objectively better at almost everything, but at the same time I've gotten much more self critical, discontent, and just unhappier in general. It's just bizarre. Like I cringe progressively harder at every single past version of myself, a year ago to 2 years ago to 3 years ago, etc. But at the same time, looking at videos and stuff, it's clear that dude was happier and just much more comfortable with and accepting of himself than I am now. I think one thing I really appreciate is how all my friends and family just accepted me like I was, they looked straight to my core which hasn't really changed much tbh. 

I really commend my past self's single minded passion for ECE tho, just working all day and all night long towards the pursuit of a vision. I used to come up with and implement super cool ideas all the time, and lose myself in the tasks. These days I have trouble not thinking about myself and how much I still have to improve. And I always used to give myself some slack and I was comfortable with all my flaws. Now, I'm more of an all or nothing kinda guy. It's all consuming. 

I want everything, I wanna Excel in everything, and if not, I'd rather have nothing than live a mediocre existence. Any area of life that I can get better at gnaws at the back of my mind, thinking that when I reach that peak I'll be able to rest and congratulate myself, but once I reach the peak I realize there are many more peaks to climb in other areas. It's nonstop. 

And there's a big difference in improving yourself in every way when you're self assured and love yourself unconditionally vs when you're restless and think if you can't become better at everything you care about, it's all pointless. Sorry for the long rant, just wanted to share"

2020-08-19 01:32:29,noentic,-1,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-18-2020

**Context -**

The S&P 500 increased 0.2% on Tuesday, setting new closing and intraday highs for the first time since February in the process. The Nasdaq Composite also set new highs with a 0.7% gain, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) and Russell 2000 (-1.0%) finished in negative territory. 

The new highs were reached shortly after the open on the heels of blowout earnings reports from Walmart (WMT 134.71, -0.89, -0.7%) and Home Depot (HD 285.00, -3.24, -1.1%), better-than-expected housing starts and building permits data for July, and continued upwards momentum in mega-cap stocks like Amazon (AMZN 3312.49, +130.08, +4.1%). 

In sell-the-news fashion, the S&P 500, including WMT and HD, quickly descended into negative territory. An intraday rebound, however, did give the S&P 500 an incremental new high in the afternoon as investors gravitated toward mega-cap stocks within the consumer discretionary (+1.5%), communication services (+1.1%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors.

Conversely, investors generally avoided small-caps and value-oriented stocks within the energy (-1.7%), financials (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and industrials (-0.5%) sectors. Interestingly, the Dow (-0.2%) was a better representation of today's action, as declining issues did outnumber advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. 

Separately, Politico reported that Senate Republicans are aiming to introduce a smaller stimulus package that will provide $300/week in enhanced unemployment, money for the USPS, and more money for small businesses. Additional fiscal support would provide investors some confidence in the large retailers sustaining their strong performances. 

In other corporate news, Oracle (ORCL 55.18, +1.19, +2.2%) reportedly joined the list of companies trying to acquire TikTok US. Kohl's (KSS 20.01, -3.44, -14.7%) said it experienced a softer back-to-school selling season. Teva Pharma (TEVA 10.48, -1.11, -9.6%) is reportedly being sued by the U.S. government over alleged kickbacks violating the False Claims Act.

U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell another 0.6% to 92.30, which benefited gold futures ($2013.2/ozt, +14.50, +0.7%). WTI crude futures declined 0.2%, or $0.09, to $42.80/bbl.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC Minutes from the July 28-29 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.

My theory:

SRNE is acquiring SmartPharm, which we know is public info. Someone from their management team is probably stepping into the role as CFO. [https://smartpharmtx.com/management-team](https://smartpharmtx.com/management-team)

Look at this fucking guy: John C. Thomas, Jr., CPA

Mr. Thomas has more than 40 years of experience in a variety of financial and accounting positions, with the last 33 years spent in the medical, pharmaceutical, and device fields.... 

&#x200B;

You think he's about to be held accountable to anyone except the CEO directly?  Just look at this Mr. Thomas, Jr.  He ain't about to report to someone with 20 years less experience.  He's about to run the whole fucking operation."

Not sure when this trend began, could have been just today but if this began recently, its indicative of people's increasing unwillingness to bet against tech, even as nasdaq breaks record highs, and willingness to rather bet against S&P (yes I know s&p is heavily weighted with tech, but not nearly as much as nasdaq), even with how high valuations are now...

I would say, with the perception people have of the S&P, generally investors believe it to be more representative of American economic health than any other index, people trust big tech a lot more than they do than the general economy of the US."

I changed my whole strategy and was pretty churned up over the lost. I took another 1000 and threw it in and made it all back on TSLA. I am now cash gang and literally only use my day trades each week to make my money back. Been riding this TSLA wave and I'm up about 650 bucks on the year. Ended up pulling 2k back out of the market from my initial investment so I don't lose it all again. I feel good! CASH GANG! too volatile to hold things over night unless it's a sure win.

* Everyone and their wife's boyfriend is saying that MSFT Teams is a threat, but why hasn't that tanked Zoom?
* Lots of insider selling
   * Sure, this is probably the biggest red flag
* There is also lots of buying being done by ARKK (look at Twitter for details)
* Slack is basically at pre-covid levels, but none of the tailwinds from Covid have gone away, spare perhaps a general slow down in economic activity
   * Some sort of communication tool is a must for any sort of remote work
   * Slack has a deep suite of apps that allow for things like
      * Devops activities
      * Support systems
      * File sharing
* ""Our HQ is Slack"" is an exciting idea that has popped into my mind
* Sure, Slack is \~$17 bb in market cap, but other companies are way, way above this even though they don't need to be

I know that there's a lot of people that probably got burned on some OTM options on $WORK this summer (outside of the Q1 earnings runup). But I keep coming back to this company as one that doesn't have an earning beat priced in. 

I'm dumb?"

-

You got some uh uh uhhh vegtible oil and some salt. 

-

You draw the GEX trajectory symbol NORTH of the DIX dark pool activity 

THIS WEEK, don't be drawing some year long DIX lines , make sure its in the east of the oil pool just inside your front door. 

-

Okay great, you should be looking and there should be a GEX in the north and a DIX in the east.

 Now to finish it off. 

-

Take your tender knife and cut a slit in your palm or the palm of a loved one and leave some of your life energy, that's blood for the stoopids out there, and you create a bridge between the GEX and the DIX and you spell out whichever index or stock ticker in the west.

-

 West is best. Spell it out with sugar, not salt. There you go. You should be fine. 

-

Wash up and immediately goto bed, if you don't fall asleep immediately, then repeat the DD.

DO NOT use the same door, use a window, another door, a vent if you have to. DO NOT USE THE SAME DOOR."

It was originally released for the 3DO in 1995; ports of the game for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were later developed by Beam Software, and a PC version was licensed by Microsoft and released for Microsoft Windows. It was a pack-in game for Panasonic models of the 3DO later in the console's life. It is the first in the Gex series of video games, and introduces players to the title character, a wisecracking, television-obsessed gecko voiced by comedian Dana Gould, who must venture through the ""Media Dimension"" and defeat Rez, the overlord of the dimension who wants to make Gex into his new network mascot.

High Gex means MM’s sell rips and buy dips. Low/negative Gex means MM’s sell dips and buy rips. So high Gex just means any movement will be subdued, low Gex means any movement is magnified. 

Also, the DIX/GEX indicator just tells us what happened today, it’s just a guide for what could potentially happen in the future. Which no one knows.

It is good to note that (almost) every time DIX has gone below 40% in the past few years, it has meant a drop usually follows sometime in the next month or two.

2020-08-18 21:49:25,RayCashIsTrashDalio,10,"https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?

Get the fuck out. Massive gamma spike today combined with a fair amount of dark pool selling. Gamma has never spiked this fucking hard before. Usually indicates a massive amount of put buying and people bracing for a correction. The last 3 times gamma came even close to the level we saw today was January 8th, 2020 (Institutions knew about coronavirus and loaded up on puts, while retail didn't care). June 10th, 2020: Lead right up to the correction and drop from 320 to 300 in SPY on June 11th. And July 9th, 2020, where a lot of tech stocks dumped like 5-10% in a single day on July 10th. Think of GEX as how much volatility institutions are expecting. If it's low, people aren't expecting much volatility. If it's high, people are expecting a ton of volatility and a potential correction, thus purchasing more puts as protection to protect from that volatility (which somewhat also kind of reduces volatility in a way)."

2020-08-18 21:05:40,thatjitzguy,25,So when Kodak spiked I bought calls. The value of them went up a lot in a few seconds. Then they halted the stock because of the drastic change in price. It wouldn’t let me sell options during the halt (I tried). Once things resumed the price had adjusted low enough that I lost over 10k. How is that allowed?.. “hey I see that stock price is up a lot.. and you’re making money from it. Time out. We gotta adjust the price and drop it a ton then you can continue”

2020-08-18 21:02:46,ProOrlando,7,It’s funny because it appears the fed bypassed a recession by printing money. All these retail sales flying higher?? Why?? Because people actually made more money during the “pandemic” vs pre pandemic. The stimulus and unemployment basically paid people more money than they were making previous to March. Therefore spending more money on junk products. Makes you wonder why the fed didn’t just print money every recession the last 50 years..? If you can take away all consumer pain by just printing money and giving money to people to spend to prop up consumer spending then what is this game we play?? Smh

1. tmrw red, and wed night fed purchases so pump thur, friday green.  Then all weekend fake news and every youtuber talks about how the markets are at a new ATH during a PaNdEmIc.

2.  Between tmrw and Friday we pull back 5%ish.  And postpone ATH a week or two

Im bullish but something doesnt smell right.  No stim news, no vaccine news.  Pretty much no news.  Im all cash now except for AMD poots because AMD is now a meme stock that wasnt suppose to happen.  If #1 than NVDA or AMZN calls Wed eod would be good.  If #2 than rip tech call holders.  Thanks for listening to my TED talk"

Girl that I've been friends with for the better part of the last decade decided to catch feelings for me right before I move across the country. She's kinda giving me an ultimatum, relationship or lose her forever. Sucks because if life had worked out in a different way that placed us in the same city for an extended period of time, I could probably see myself marrying this girl. But it's not meant to be right now, I guess, a relationship isn't going to happen. My way of life + career choice + the distance just isn't compatible the way I see it. She wants to talk tonight and I don't think it's going to go well. I'm not great at handling goodbyes.
