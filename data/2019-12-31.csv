This market can go up or down, especially in the short term, but there is no fucking way we continue to see this efficiency as consistently as we have since October. It's like never happened to this extent.

It's actually an opportunity to be an options BUYER. Buy fuckin straddles dude. This piece of shit has gotten way too easy as a premium seller, there is no downside for ATM weeklies. It's always there. Never breaks out.

In hindsight, the VIX-pocalypse that went on an hour before the market spike should have been an easy trade (long the SPY). I thought there was some tom-foolery going on about options liquidity driving down the IV as traders tried to lock in options profits before close.

Maybe that was the case, regardless I got ass blasted on 01/31 VIX calls I started buying after the 3% dip (that quickly turned into a 6% dip)"
