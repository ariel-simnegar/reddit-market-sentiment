Somebody else mentioned this theory in the comments, but I will follow up and say some of the people running operations for suppliers are seriously fucking stupid. There‚Äôs major congestion in transportation networks with everybody ordering shit. When a supplier ran out of stock for a certain item it was normal for them to list the delivery dates as something ridiculous like three months out just so nobody would order it. 

I‚Äôm betting there‚Äôs a huge back order on these cabinets and somebody just thought jacking the price up a ridiculous amount would do the same thing.

2020-07-10 07:21:53,Emerl,1,"Regarding the Wayfair rumor, I came up with an explanation:

1. Household products like cabinet, bedroom set etc are sometime given fancy human names so the product names are not that weird.

2. When a product is out of stock, instead of delisting and relist later, vendors sometime change the price to 1000x higher so no one won't buy, and change back to correct price when product is back in stock to save the effort.

3. Regarding same product pic, see point #2. They are probably just using the same pic as placeholder while waiting for stock info to be corrected."

2020-07-10 06:23:46,python_js,21,"First off, I‚Äôm not gay. Never been attracted to a man. I mean, I can acknowledge when a man is handsome, but in no way am I sexually attracted to men.

But it seems like every time I buy a put, I end up with this disturbing, overwhelming desire to have a dick up my ass. I don‚Äôt understand it for the life of me. When I am sober, the idea of getting a dick up my ass is, honestly (and I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive here) disgusting. But when I‚Äôm deep in puts, I‚Äôll be jacking off so hard it‚Äôs insane, and I just can‚Äôt nut- and all I can think of is how much I want a dick up my ass. As I‚Äôm sitting here, I‚Äôm sober and the very idea of taking it anal grossed me out; but get me riding some puts, and it‚Äôs a whole different story. I‚Äôm scared that one day I am gonna fuck around on a put binge and actually go through with it and end up with a dick up my shitter- and I know that once I sober up I am gonna be disgusted with myself and traumatized.

Wtf is this? Does anyone else go through something like this?

Literally the first sentence- I make it clear I am NOT gay. And I just took this test that says I am 100% not gay. If I WERE gay, I would have already gotten butt fucked because I have ass for days (I‚Äôm an athlete) and gay guys want to get in my turds like all the damn time. But the thought of that seriously disgusts me. I know I‚Äôm not gay. But somehow buying SPY puts me want to get fucked up my ass. Maybe it is some sort of over-abundance or otherwise imbalance of neurotransmitters that makes someone gay- maybe that‚Äôs where ‚Äúgay‚Äù came from- cuz the dudes that were fuckin each other‚Äôs buttholes seemed so damn happy all the time due to all the serotonin/dopamine/whatever else chemical in their brains. Maybe it‚Äôs all tied together. The chemicals interacting in your brain 100% affect the way you feel and act- that isn‚Äôt up for debate- just plain established fact. So why is it hard to believe that altering the chemicals in the brain a certain way could make you gay WHILE LOSING MONEY ON PUTS(even tho normally, the same person is definitely not gay at all- and has never gay in his life!) ??"

I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner.

2020-07-10 04:41:58,Smart202020,2,"Is there anyway individual investors can buy junk bonds?  I looked up buyable bonds on TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, and could not find any.  I was looking at an American Airlines 6/1/2022 maturity bond that was selling for $52 with a 5% coupon.   So you could literally invest 52 (or some multiple of that) and get back $100 in 23 months.  I'd like to take the risk of American Airlines staying in business for 2 years and me doubling my money.  But I can't see how I can buy into this offering.

Sure, you could buy the equity itself  and hope it doubles, but there's more risk there.  Bondholders most likely will be paid at least 80-90% at worst if AAL went bankrupt.  Or if the stock doesn't move at all, you'd still have doubled your money"

No.

I know ‚Äúthe stock market isn‚Äôt the economy‚Äù shut up dummy, to the average low-IQ person, stock market and economy are literally synonyms. 

People on MSNBC can giddily crow ‚ÄúAll of the stock market gains since January 2017 have been completely erased‚Äù as they try to hide their joyous smiles. 

They need the country in as shitty of a state as possible so people will vote for a pervert with dementia who dutifully carries out the orders of the central banks.

If you disagree, don‚Äôt comment some stupid shit like ‚ÄúLMAO‚Äù. It just shows you‚Äôre low-IQ and have no capacity for critical evaluation. Tell me why you disagree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In options pricing formulas, the Greek letter [gamma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) denotes how responsive an [options contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) price is to fluctuations in the price of the underlying security. Investors in options may engage in [gamma hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma-hedging.asp), to limit the risk associated with strong price moves in the underlying security.

‚ÄúDealers being long gamma is like a black-hole effect, a negative feedback loop that squishes volatility,‚Äù as Kokou Agbo-Bloua, global head of flow [strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-strategist.asp) and solution, financial engineering, at Societe Generale, told the Journal. He calls extended periods of low volatility a ‚Äúgamma trap,‚Äù since they tend to be followed by big spikes in volatility."

Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: ""Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales.""   

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.

This literally means that if VIX (IV) spikes, option dealers have to buy the index. Talk about liquidity! There's a catch: If, for whatever reason, those customer-sold puts end up trading in-the-money (ITM), fickle vanna starts demanding liquidity whenever IVs rise. And here's the feedback loop that crashes the market: Liquidity deteriorates, IVs rise to compensate, and the rise in IVs, by virtue of the newly-ITM puts (negative VEX), demand that option dealers short more of the index. 

It becomes impossible to sate the latent demand for liquidity, and the selloff only ends when VIX is so high that it can only go lower. When VIX does go lower, VEX will then force options dealers to buy just as much as they were forced to sell before."

2020-07-10 01:30:31,iminfam0us,2,"Alright guys, since some of you at least listen to my predictions here's my thoughts.  I think we're trading sideways til earnings start.  Small caps will sink, tech will rally.  The issue with this market is there is an unprecedented retail interest (bbg article on citadel today said 25% on recent days for this large market maker), and big institutions cautious.  Ofc with other asset classes in the shitter with low rates and structured credit teatering along except for some newer vintage clo's and crt, stocks seem like best option.  But everyone and their mother knows this rally is absurd and the valuations and fundamentals are not supporting this; they do not have strong convictions at the current prices so any news which is perceived as bad and starts a sell off will likely cascade.  If the big tech giants has bad earnings I would be very worried (will be interesting to see reaction given the little guidance they've given).  Think market starting to top out, but this is a longer process; don't buy short dated options or theta will fuck you (unless you've been buying calls recently)."

*Sloane Robinson is closing as it struggles to raise enough capital, joining a string of high-profile hedge funds to shutter in recent years.

The firm, which began investing in 1994, will shut at the end of 2020 and wind down its Global Opportunities and Global Compounder portfolios, according to a letter to investors seen by Bloomberg. David Gale, chief executive officer of the London-based investment firm, declined to comment beyond the letter.

‚ÄúDespite strong investment performance amidst difficult market conditions, we have not succeeded in acquiring the required assets to support this franchise and the partnership remains dependent on revenue from the legacy funds of the founding partners,‚Äù the firm told investors in the letter dated Monday.*"

I am trying to find the solution for this situation I am in 
Here is the situation:

My account was 15.5k originally and I had already executed 3 day trades in past 5 days. I wanted to execute 4th day trade to save some position so I transferred 10k instantly in RH account to make it above 25k+ and then executed the day trade.

So far I did 18 Day trades ( I know it is crazy ) but I do not see any PDT market on my profile.  I have the following questions regarding my account

1. Am I marked as a PDT ? If yes where can I find that notification
2. If I am not marked as PDT yet, can I withdraw the 10k I deposited today and go back to 15.5k or do I need to wait for 5 rolling days before I do this
3. Does the 18 day trades go away if you do not execute anymore day trades for next 5 rolling days?

My goal is to make sure that I get back my 10k that I deposited so I don‚Äôt end up investing that as well. 

Thank you in Advance."

\- CVS was down over 3% today driven by WBA (Walgreens)  today where they reported down a big miss.  However, the miss was primarily driven by Boots in the UK where margins were lower due to low ASP and almost non-existent foot traffic in April.  The bright spot was Walgreens sales in the US.  Market overreacted and brought CVS lower and will rebound. 

**JPM 8/21 90C**

JPM has been consolidating the past few weeks down from it's $106 high a month ago $141 trailing 12 month high.  I'm expecting a run up Fri/Mon into earnings. Gold and Silver have been on a tear this year and who is the largest holder?  JPM.  They own 25 million ounces of gold and over 1 billion ounces of silver.

Bought and sold at $47/$92; but looking to buy in again whenever the price settles somewhat. Thoughts? I only invest in tech cause I don't know anything else; but insurance seems like an industry that could be snuck up on by a user-friendly and mobile option like this."

NIO doesn't have Elon, so they can't reach that kind of greatness exhibit by TSLA. But attaining 5% should be doable by mortals... especially with the backing of CCP.

I'm a simple person; I vote for orange man if he helps me get tendies and will vote the other guy if he tries take my tendies away. I believe most people are like me. Therefore, with tons of people making money via NIO shares, it should be totally safe from ""foreign conflict"" before election date."

Feeling bad for taking marginal profits instead of diamond handsing.  

You do realize the best savings account will give you 2.5-3% max on your investment right?  ETFs proud themselves on 5%.  Taking a sure profit on a volatile stock doesnt make you weak, it makes you smart (looking at you AMD). 

While a ridiculous profit margin is what we are all going after, there's nothing wrong in taking a profit while you can.

If you miss a large pump, try and figure out what made you miss it and examine yourself while doing so.  

We're all here for tendies in the end. A singular tendie is still better than having to sell yourself to your local pimp to get back one.

2020-07-09 20:38:55,mango1144,6,"Made $800 on LVGO today.

Current Positions:

EBS 100C 8/21 x1 - This is a great Rona play and I expect it to break 100 by the end of July if not sooner. It's contracted with so many big Rona vaccine players and has that sweet BARDA funding.

PCG 10C 8/21 x5 - Cautiously entering into a small position here (will buy ~3-5 contracts/day using winnings from other trades). I'm expecting this to continue to bleed but eventually rally in the near future as the cheap entry price draws in big money. Looks like today big money did more buying than selling, which is a good sign. I'll very likely jump ship on this play.

Near term plan: 
1) Look for re-entry on LVGO. 
2) Increase EBS position if/when it dips.
3) Either jump ship or increase PCG position depending on how my hands feel tomorrow.
4) Planning on making an earnings play on PII but will probably wait until end of next week for this. I'll be loading up on PII 100C 8/21."

Not that the VIX is skyrocketing but rather, it's not really going down when we move up and we continue to have these bad drops that do recover. I think the VIX is indicating that it's only a matter of time until they don't recover. DXY went up near the end there and stayed, even with some movement upwards in the market. If the Asia/EU markets are bad tonight, we might be really bad tomorrow. We've ping ponged between this range hard and couldn't get back to where we started today.
