I, like most of you, have been riding Tesla like a mechanical bull (pun absolutely intended) for the last month or longer.  Was doing well, cause how could you not?

At an attempt to take one more ride up, I bought calls on Mondays first big dip into the 470‚Äôs.  I bought some 500c weeklies and they were immediately up huge, and then immediately down pretty good.  Was going to hold out for hope but thankfully sold yesterday at open to avoid a pretty massive loss (still lost around 2K)

In an attempt to reap back some of the losses I bought one single 455p expiring 9/4.  It‚Äôs going to be up pretty decent today if this price holds til open as my actual strike is around 436-437.

I know theta‚Äôs a bitch but I also feel like holding out til EOD May be the move.  So the conversation to be had here, is realistically without optimistic bull blinders on ‚Äî where do we see Tesla going today and would you hold this put contract or not?"

2020-09-03 06:21:34,robbinhood69,36,"So the theory for why VIX has been creeping up is because MM are hedging with index calls since they're getting gamma squeezed in single stock tickers

I've also noticed it's been a lot harder to make money off of single stock tickers lately. For awhile it seemed like single stock ticker options were the play but for the past month especially it looks like index options are outperforming by a long shot. I'm wondering if MM are gamma squeezing indices

Anyways I'm done buying single stock calls and switching to index calls only. FWIW I think we're barely getting the bubble going....at lower levels I think funds may have had some solvency risk if things went the wrong way but now I think we don't go down until we pop the bubble first, and the bubbles got a long way up to go imo.

If I understand correctly, implied volatility is just a more complicated way to explain what the supply and demand of an option is hence why after an earnings call everyone gets crushed if they are OTM on calls?  So my question is then why would you ever hold onto calls through and earnings call if you were OTM? Or at least OTM by a decent margin still. 

Example I have FedEx 10/16 $260 calls I bought before they started mooning. They have an earnings call on 9/15. I would be an idiot to hold those through the earnings call right?"

The two sums essentially represent the expected variance of the APPLE returns up to two option expiration dates that bracket a 30-day period of time.

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilege0/_/g3t84d0/?context=1

TLDR: SLV go uppies if u don‚Äôt buy FD‚Äôs you retard

_____
I think the pessimism is justified and I‚Äôve been super close to hitting the sell button on SLV a LOT. 

The thing is, SLV is a metal ETF and not a tech etf. It‚Äôs got much stronger fundamentals but isn‚Äôt affected by things like earnings reports. It‚Äôs also objectively manipulated by banks. 

if a WSB trader buys SLV thinking it trades like AAPL and will moon in a week or two, they‚Äôll get burned on their FD‚Äôs. 

WSB users also point out, accurately, that silver is manipulated heavily by banks. This is true and you can see clear evidence of this on the charts. 

However, SLV isn‚Äôt a battle between traders and the bank. It‚Äôs a battle between the Fed and the banks. Literally every single fundamental aspect supports metals rising and dollar dropping (all this üñ®üíµ is impossible to reverse). The banks‚Äô know that this is a losing battle, so they‚Äôre trying to shake as many üßª hands as possible before switching their positions to be long on silver. 


So, WSB SLV haters are right; Silver is manipulated and you could make as much profit in tech if you play your calls right. 

But in the end, Silver is a guaranteed winner. Whether or not there is a rug pull, the trillions dollars being printed are going to drop the value of the dollar to multi-year lows (which, by the way, it‚Äôs already hit a multi year low multiple times this week). Buying SLV calls is timing the hike in silver right. With the September FOMC, senate stimulus talks, and the election coming, uncertainty in the economy is going to increase. 

Unless the economy is magically fixed overnight, I think SLV is a very safe bet for profits. 

Positions:

SLV $26c 1/15/2021 (x20) ü•à
AAPL $120c 1/15/2021 (x4) üçè
RKT $26c 10/16/2020 (x1) üöÄ
XLE $37.5 9/11/2020 (x11) (this was a random $160 play based on unusual whales)"

2020-09-03 04:52:13,adoseofcommonsense,8,"In 2010, I was employed by Verizon as retail sales associate. When we we're not selling phones , a large portion of our time was spent dealing with customers billing issues. Most, would come in to the store to try to negotiate a payment plan. I was always surprised that a large number of those customers were real estate agents. Like clockwork i'd pull up their bill and explain their payment options. After a small conversation they would ALL open up to me and attempt to tell me about the days they were 'raking in the bucks'.  Sometimes I'd bite and ask them about the days right before the housing crash. One lady in particular told me she was making 50k a month in commissions selling homes and couldn't believe  she didn't have enough to pay for her phone bill. I would sympathize and then ask them all the same question ""Did you know it was a bubble?"" Ill never forget this particular moment, where she laughed at me and said ""We all knew it was a bubble, the whole industry did, we just didn't think it could pop that fast""

&#x200B;

Conversely, 

Years after I left Verizon, I became a personal friend to my retail store manager. I knew he had money but didn't know he was a multimillionaire until he confessed to it. He quickly told me that he was just dumb and lucky, dumb enough to risk it all on multiple highly leveraged properties and lucky enough to sell them all during the peak , just a few months before the bubble popped. He's a super cool dude with a killer work ethic, so i'm glad it was him that got lucky but man did I not learn a lesson.

2020-09-03 04:26:14,Grrr_Mondays,18,"Probably not the place to post, but I‚Äôve always seen WSB as a wholesome place to vent about their problems and frustrations, so here it is: 

Earlier this week I found out that the mother of my kid has started seeing someone else. We basically called it quits a month ago after 3 years of trying to make things work and deep down I feel like the only one to blame is myself. I put my career ahead of her and my daughter. honestly, I wish I never did it and should‚Äôve put my family first, the money isn‚Äôt worth it. Then I spent the past year trying to force things to workout and it made things worse. I could really use a fresh start but I‚Äôm stuck in a small ass hick town because of COVID and there‚Äôs absolutely no one here relatable to (I‚Äôm a single parent at 25 working a white collar job making 6figs) I am supposed to move to NYC in January 2021 for my job but with how things are going, once I move I won‚Äôt see my daughter as much and it kills me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm in this shithole of a purgatory for the meantime where I get to chose between the two and the only thing I have as a distraction is trading. I‚Äôm getting to the point though where I could care less about making or losing money and I just don‚Äôt know if I should take a break or what. On one side, if I keep trading i have a distraction and I can make tendies to get a second apartment/fly out more frequently to spend time with my daughter. On the other side, I can stop trading and really work on myself. Maybe moving earlier and adding a little distance can help me get back on my feet, get back into a healthy relationship and be a better parent. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do and really could use any advice.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice. It means a lot right now and to be honest I don‚Äôt have many people to talk about it with. I lost a lot of my good friends during this time and the ones that I still have wouldn‚Äôt have the guts to be honest with me."

We saw an inverted yield curve last year which is usually a great predictor of recessions. This recessions though could turn into the next Great Depression. I‚Äôm not even trying to scare anyone here into buying puts because the economy is not the stock market. The situation on a macro scale though is very fuckeddd. I‚Äôm kind of scared tbh for my future and my whole generations.

Consulted for some older tech companies that were on there last legs then bounced around a few start-ups that were planning IPO's.

I keep about 5 in my closet as trophies.   


Salary jumped from 55k-100k in the span of 6 months. Still have all my old contract letters. Nobody questioned it.   
It was an absolute free for all. Hitting the club after work for bottle service on the corporate accounts and then right back to it.   
Felt pretty invincible and thought the party was never going to end.

2020-09-03 03:19:58,GoldFox1984,11,"Posted this earlier but expanded on it + positions:

Tech bubble was caused by dumb companies that made no money (Pets.com famously sold merchandise 27% below cost)

2008 was caused by the housing crisis (evictions are now illegal).

2001 crash was caused by 9/11.

What could pop this bubble? (If it's even a bubble). I‚Äôm holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: ""Stonks go up"" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.

But at the same time I‚Äôm starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? 
Money is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.

I understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? 
What will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.
Sometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen. But maybe we're just smarter than the rest and making as much as we can while the printer is on (this doesn't sound right either).

Vix measures volume of out of the money Puts or CALLS on SPY.


Vix rising isn't always a bad thing. But it rapidly rising is just a sign that more of the market thinks a major up/down swing is incoming. Not that one will happen.

2020-09-02 22:42:10,Revolant742,1,"~~1987~~ September 2020 

Stock market prices plunged in a tumultuous wave of selling, giving Wall Street its worst day in history and raising fears of a recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average, considered a benchmark of the market's health, plummeted a record 508 points, to 1,738.74, based on preliminary calculations. That 22.6 percent decline was the worst since World War I and far greater than the 12.82 percent drop on Oct. 28, 1929, that along with the next day's 11.7 percent decline preceded the Great Depression.

With Friday's plunge of 108.35 points, the Dow has fallen more than 26 percent in the last two sessions. Unprecedented Trading
Yesterday's frenzied trading on the nation's stock exchanges lifted volume to unheard of levels. On the New York Stock Exchange, an estimated 604.3 million shares changed hands, almost double the previous record of 338.5 million shares set just last Friday.

Indeed, the panic selling may have been bolstered by the news that the United States Navy, *under Trump's orders*, destroyed an Iranian offshore oil platform in the central Persian Gulf yesterday, and Iran vowed retaliation. But many experts seemed to think that a major catalyst was fears of a breakdown in accords to maintain trading and currency stability between the United States and its major trading partners.

Discussing yesterday's collapse, ~~John J. Phelan Jr.~~ Jerome Powell, chairman of the ~~Big Board~~ Federal Reserve, said: ''It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to see. We were fortunate this occurred when the American economy is very strong. We are not operating in an environment of weakness.''"

2020-09-02 22:19:23,MattDamonIsGod,6,"Effort post: related to politics but purely in the market sense

So, as some of you retards may have seen (or maybe not---too busy watching graphs go up and cuckolding porn), Democratic analysts warned that on Election Day it may appear that Trump has won reelection by a landslide ([https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-group-trump-election-night-scenarios-a554e8f5-9702-437e-ae75-d2be478d42bb.html](https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-group-trump-election-night-scenarios-a554e8f5-9702-437e-ae75-d2be478d42bb.html)) but ultimately lose when all of the mail-in votes are counted.

Why does this matter?

Well, think about it. Do you think Trump is just gonna concede when all the late votes start rolling in and the tides start switching to Biden's favor? No, of course not. Election fraud charges will be slung, and I don't see Trump conceding ever. I see him challenging it in court and we have a long, drawn-out process where it isn't clear who is winning or who will win.

What does that mean?

Extreme volatility during all of this. I expect extreme dips and rises as this shitshow unfolds with investors unsure of what the fuck the end result is. I'm not going to hold any positions coming up on Election Day, and unless you're a Matrix-viewing autist or just a plain retard you shouldn't, either.

How to play this?

I don't know. Yet. I'll come up with a scheme as the picture clears as we draw closer to the apocalypse, and if you're smart you will, too."

Quit your bitching and process one thing and process it well. Read it 10-1000 times if you have to.

We‚Äôre in a fucking pandemic. Only the top dogs/upcoming and unfortunately overvalued as fuck monsters like ZM & CRM are gonna dominate and destroy agenda-related items like quarterly earnings. Their leaders and engineers don‚Äôt give a shit about how much their shares have gone up this past month or year. Even if they do; they care much more about making their products or services the only and most attractive offering in their domain.

Stop latching on to what you heard or what you think you may know of a company. If it‚Äôs not the top of its game or the leader in what it‚Äôs doing, even if new or old, assess against the current situation and play accordingly.

Yes ZM & CRM may not deserve the followed surges but hey, is anyone gonna need any less of either of these 2, especially during these times? Prolly not.

2020-09-02 21:10:24,Revolant742,21,"VIX is broken because RSI is so fucking high on SPY. VIX doesn't necessarily mean bearish, but it does quantify the volume of put options being placed. When RSI gets this high, it doesn't usually end well.

Here is other options because its not always that simple.

A. üêª have no where else to play rn. Lots of volume on other puts from bulls changing teams. Piles in on VIX.

B. Algos are hedging bigly. Anyone going long will hedge vol.

C. Institutions have their üçë cheeks clenched but won't sell if they don't need to. More hedging.

D. Its clear this is a bubble. SPY moved $8 in two days above ATH without much resistance. More if you count the last three weeks really. So even retail bulls are trying to buy puts. 

E. Election coming up.

Only threat to VIX really is flat trading. If we hit resistance and trade flat that could grind out VIX. But that im not even 100% because with RSI on SPY this high VXX might just stay flat too.

February saw similar VIX behavior because of rising Covid-19 concerns but people also forget that there were other bearish signals around then too. March was really just a perfect storm."

That‚Äôs what caused the initial pump. It got sold off hard eod because large investors already knew what the outcome would be, and had determined that the stock had been pumped too high and took profits. The good news is that leaps will be cheap, and I recommend you get some. They made $3.5B profit, and have $1B cash on hand."

Third Quarter Outlook

We expect the followingranges compared to the year-earlier period:

Closed loan volume of between $82 billion and $85 billion, or an increase of 105% to 112% compared to $40.3 billion in the third quarter of 2019.
Gain on sale margins of 4.05% to 4.30%, which would be an improvement of 23% to 31% compared to 3.29% in the third quarter of 2019."

Here's Citron's research. Speaks for itself. : https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fluidigm-The-Stock-That-Will-Spit-to-35.pdf

Here's the catalyst that's going to make it pop. The governor is likely going to say that every university in Missouri is going to start using this test. 

https://www.kfvs12.com/2020/09/01/gov-parson-hold-press-conference-washington-university-school-medicine/

FLDM is going to be a rocketship tomorrow. Fuidigm developed this test in conjunction with the Washington University Medical School and it's going to be the new gold standard. The stock has been selling off since Abbott released the $5 antigen test, but that doesn't work for population testing. All colleges are doing saliva tests now, which is the only viable way to move forward and FLDM is the only company with a product that works for such high throughput. 

Here's further evidence that literally spells out what the press conference is going to be about: https://www.kfvs12.com/2020/08/31/gov-parson-stop-jackson-mo-thursday/
