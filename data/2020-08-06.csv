Two key prices to watch if selling pressure continues. The mid-line support around $28. If that does not hold, the bottom of the channel is around $26 which is where I would make a very large buy.

Did they not know that they could do this? Like we've seen in Japan?  
All the steps taken by Jpow has been done before, it's not a mystery.  
So why didn't we just print as much in 2008 and practically not have a recession then?  
Because the fed has a diminishing effect that, once it's ran its course, will be much less effective.  
So the fed came in a little late in 2008 but it allowed them to also assist with the recovery and to propel us out of the recession.  
But now.. with the huge influx from the fed, any assistance to help us OUT of this is going to be null. Jpow has kept us afloat during this crisis but wont be able to help us get OUT like the fed did in 2008.  
So the crisis doesn't last as long but the recovery is going to be very very long lasting.  
Jpow fucked us. Well.. mostly he wanted to fuck the Orange Man but he fucked us too."

2020-08-07 09:13:54,CptTonyStark,6,"On the morning of October 19, 1987, the Wall Street Journal ran this plot comparing the Dow in the 1980s to the Dow in the 1920s up to and for a month after the crash of 1929. The 2 plots were aligned so that the current date lined up with the date of the 1929 crash.

https://i.imgur.com/tABR3eh.jpg

When the big price declines on the morning of October 19, 1987, began, many people started questioning if ""it"" was happening again and panic selling set in. The image of the 1929 crash provided a suggestion of how much the market might crash before rebounding.

The Dow fell 22.6% that day, a little less than the 2 day loss of 23.1% during the 1929 crash."

On Black Thursday, 24th October, 1929, the Dow fell 12.9% but recovered substantially to close only 2.1% down.

The New York Times noted in it's Monday edition that Wall Street, ""normally deserted and quiet on Sunday as a country graveyard, hummed with activity as bankers and brokers strove to put their houses in order after the most strenuous week in history... When the bell clangs at 10 o'clock this morning for the resumption of trading, the houses will be abreast of their work and ready for what may come.""

""Sightseers strolled from street to street, gazing curiously at the Stock Exchange building and the Morgan banking offices across the way, centers of last week's dramatic happenings. Here and there a sightseer picked up from the street a vagrant slip of ticker tape, as visitors seize upon spent bullets on a battlefield as sovenirs. Sightseeing buses made special trips through the district.""

On Monday, October 28, 1929, the Wall Street Journal ran a front page editorial stating ""**everyone in responsible positions says that business conditions are sound.**""

On October 28, 1929, the Dow fell 12.8% in 1 day. The following day, it dropped a further 11.7%, thus falling 23.1% in 2 days."

I am not a gay bear who thinks the world is going to come crashing down, but given the underlying volatility in the market, when a misstep comes it will cause the market to stutter significantly and having some insurance to capitalize on that will be key..

2020-08-07 07:51:23,RayCashIsTrashDalio,12,"Finally realized why I've been on a big loss streak recently. It's cause I developed wet toilet paper hands. I only sell shit for a loss, never for a gain. And for things I have with a gain, I hold onto and only sell when it turns into a loss. This means that my portfolio only goes down every single day, and I am always red. I diamond handed puts from the March lows, which is probably why I learned that diamond hands are retarded and why I have toilet paper hands now. However, this is shit cause that means I always only sell shit when I'm down 10-15%, which usually means I'm dumping shit barely an hour after opening them, always for a loss. Should probably develop stronger hands. However, there is a point where diamond hands isn't diamond hands anymore, and at that point you're just a bagholding cuck.

*See puts from March lows, or reopening stock calls from June 10th 

TLDR: Wood hands best hands."

2020-08-07 07:47:26,CptTonyStark,1,"**What propelled the Millennium Boom of 1982-2000?**

&#x200B;

**The Internet**

The Mosaic web browser kicked off the internet age in February 1994. The user base grew significantly in 1997-1999, and as a result NASDAQ tripled. The Internet gave people a sense of mastery of the world. People could participate in the world economy and create entertainment rather than consume it passively. Spectacular S&P composite real earnings growth of 36% in 1994, 8% in '95, and 10% in '96 coupled with the advent of a revolutionary technology like the internet created the impression among the public that these events were connected, even when they were not. The emergence of new companies like E\*Trade.com and Amazon.com furthered the Internet lore, with ppl believing that a lot of new successful internet companies will gain traction.

&#x200B;

**Decline of Foreign Economic rivals**

In the late 90s, most countries started imitating the Western economic system. Communist China has been embracing market forces since the late 70s, Soviet Union broke up into smaller market-oriented states, Japan's stock market and real estate bubble burst and it entered a ""lost decade"", Asia went through a financial crisis in 1997-98. These events were seen as the weakening of major rivals and prolonged the bull run of the 90s.

&#x200B;

**Cultural and Political changes**

There was a significant rise in materialistic values, 63% of ppl in 1994 believed good life = a lot of money, vs 38% in 1975. The idea that investing in stocks is a road to quick riches went viral. Stay-at-home mothers became less admired and joined the workforce in increasing numbers, which helped propel home prices. A decline in crime rates encouraged materialistic values by making people feel more secure about flaunting expensive items.

&#x200B;

**A Republican Congress and Capital Gains Tax Cuts**

1980 saw the first Republican Senate since 1948 and in 1994 both houses became Republican and passed a lot of pro business laws: top capital gains tax was cut from 28% to 20% in 1997 and a 1999 bill would have cut tax even further, but the President vetoed it. Anticipation of future capital gains tax cuts had a favorable impact on the stock market as People held onto their stocks longer which naturally placed upward pressure on stock prices.

&#x200B;

**The baby boom and its perceived effects**

The Baby boom was marked by very high birth rates in 1946-66 so in 2000, there were an unusually large number of people aged 35-55. These people had no memory of the great depression or the world wars and were in general less anxious and more optimistic about the stock market which propelled stocks.

&#x200B;

**An expansion in media reporting of business news**

Lots of news networks focusing exclusively on finance were established, many newspapers now had exclusive money sections with investing tips, enhanced reporting and advertisement of financial investment options boosted demand for stocks. The number of articles mentioning the stock market tripled between 1990 and 1998.

&#x200B;

**Analyst's increasingly optimistic forecasts**

Among analysts recommendations on \~6000 companies in late 1999, only 1% were sell, 69% were buys, 30% were hold. 10 years earlier, the % of sells was 9 times higher. Analysts were reluctant to make sell recommendations cus they feared that the companies downgraded to sell might exclude the analysts from information sessions and prevent them from making earning forecasts. Also, The analysts were employed by firms like investment banks that underwrote securities and the firm's didn't want the analysts to do anything that might jeopardize the lucrative side of business. From 1979-99, analyst expectations of S&P500 EPS growth exceeded actual growth in 19 out of 21 yrs. The average difference b/w projected growth and actual growth was 9 percentage points. Analysts deliberately lowered quarterly EPS forecasts for individual firms according to the firm’s wishes, so the firm could report an EPS beat. Analysts were mostly realists in their quarterly growth forecasts, but went full retard in their long term growth forecasts, which pushed stocks up. Following the .com crash, the SEC imposed Regulation FD, making all informational meetings public so analysts with sell recommendations wouldn’t be excluded. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandated that analyst reports not be subject to pre publication clearance by anyone involved in investment banking and the SEC also imposed a $1.4 billion fine on the top 10 investment firms. 

&#x200B;

**The expansion of defined contribution pension plans**

Changes in employee pension plans (1st 401(k) plan was created in 1981) and the structure of tax incentives encouraged people to learn more about stocks, which increased their demand. In 1954, NYSE conducted a survey and found only 23% ppl knew what a share was and most ppl had a vague distrust of the stock market. 401(k) helped people learn by doing. The options employers offered in 401(k) plans were heavily weighted towards stocks and had no real estate options. The proliferation of 401(k) plans increased public interest in the market, which bid up the price of the stock market. 

&#x200B;

**The Growth of Mutual Funds**

In 1982, there were only 340 mutual funds. By 1998, there were 3513. Investment companies arose in the US as early as the 1820s and the 1st mutual fund was the Massachusetts Investors Trust, created in 1924. The Investment Company act of 1940 established regulations for investment companies and helped restore public confidence after the Great Depression. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1943 created Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Mutual funds proliferated rapidly after 1982 as they were used as part of  401(k) plans. They advertised widely and led to speculative price movements in stock aggregates, not just individual stocks. 

&#x200B;

**Decline of Inflation and the money illusion**

In 1982, Inflation was 4%, but ppl were concerned it might return to the 15% level experienced in 1980. Instead, inflation steadily declined to 2-3% in the 1990s and below 2% in late 90s. Public misunderstanding about inflation encouraged high expectations for inflation adjusted returns. Plots of historical stock indices are shown in nominal terms, not inflation adjusted terms, which furthered public confusion."

Warren Buffet is quoted saying ""Ehh fuck it man we did it once we can do it again. As long as the playing field remains fair America will always be the greatest nation on earth."" 

Meanwhile Jeff Bezos is quoted saying ""First my divorce now this shit? What the fuck man. Fine just give it to them but NO RAISING MINIMUM WAGE LIBCUCKS."" 

Elon Musk simply pointed to the sky and said ""Up is where things are""

Bill Gates however could not shut the fuck up about his vaccine bullshit that probably wont happen and rambled in his gay voice ""things wont be back to normal waa waa vaccine or nothing waa waa every single person on earth waa waa"".

They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

2020-08-07 04:37:31,OverAndUnder500,4,"Trump: Nobody slaps tariffs on aluminum harder than me, nobody. It's been in my family for generations - in fact I'm probably the best at slapping anything - just ask TikTok, and I love China. The American people wanted me to do more about the China virus, so I did. Doctors say eating aluminum is very effective at curing the virus, probably the greatest cure available. If the aluminum is good enough to protect a baked potato, it's good enough  - probably gooder for the American people. So we needed to encourage more Americans to make aluminum, because we know it's just going to help the world's great economy- the greatest economy in the history of the world. When the China virus goes away, everyone will say what a great job I did and thank me for slapping the Canadian aluminum."

I go upstairs, and I see pretty much the entire WSB there and a few others. They all give me high fives, shake my hand, talk with me and make me feel quite special. Though when I try to get into my bedroom, /u/ControlTheNarrative tells me that he doesn’t think it’s a good idea. I laugh it off and just go through anyway, as I would like to change from my work clothes.  
  
I go into my bedroom and I see /u/1R0NYMAN in nothing but a towel with a video recorder in his hand. He’s recording /u/analfarmer2 having sex with my girlfriend (missionary). /u/analfarmer2 is in nothing but a Nikola shirt, which I found quite strange, and he’s thrusting in and out very quickly.  
  
In my dream, I put my hand on /u/analfarmer2’s shoulder from behind and tell him, “mate, I think that’s enough”.  
  
**He responds with “My friend, is ok, no?”**  
  
**I tell him that it’s definitely not OK.**    
  
At this point my girlfriend Emily doesn’t even acknowledge my existence. /u/memecaptial comes in and gets me into a full nelson and drags me out of the room. I have been manhandled, ridiculed and disrespected in my own property, by people that I once looked up to.  
  
I’m sitting at the bottom of my stairs, quite bemused. The doorbell rings. I open the door, it’s /u/CptTonyStark. Finally, a man of such respect, regard and authority would restore order in my own household. I approach him, congratulate him on the meme losses and then go on to explain what has been happening upstairs. He has a trademark smirk on his face and tells me he will take care of it. He practically bypasses the orderly queue formed outside of my bedroom and enters as /u/analfarmer2 and /u/1R0NYMAN walk out.  
  
Then the next 30 minutes are just followed by loud thumps and squeaking which clearly shows that he was just as bad of the rest of them.  
  
At this point, I woke up because of my alarm. But as I was in the shower I was like what the fuck did I just dream about."

1. We take free Photoshop courses from here: https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=photoshop  
  
2. We then organize a tournament for making the best rendering of a potential EV car.  
  
3. We claim our car can be powered only by a couple of AAA super strength batteries (proprietary).  
  
4. **We form an LLC called Milutin Corporation. Milutin is Nikola Tesla's father, so both those companies can call us daddy!**  
  
5. We go public via a SPAC. We moon and make our tendies!  
  
Literally can't go tits up!  
  
PS: We will also have a pharma division to get some from the government.

They're supposed to be announced sometime this month. If these things are actually 50% more powerful like rumors say they are then NVDA is going to the moon. These next few weeks are earnings (which they'll probably crush) -> gpu announcement -> gpu releases over the next few months -> cyberpunk release date.

So a roman soldier earned 22.5 to 30 ounces of silver per year. 

If you compare this to a minimum wage earner today who earns about $300 per week, or to a US soldier who earns about $2000 per month, and you converted their pay into silver, then they would be earning between 80 and 100 ounces of silver each month. Or 960 to 1200 ounces each year. 

So technically speaking, silver is about 1/40th of it's all time high."

2020-08-07 02:00:06,96reltihleih,1,"There’s a reason start up social media companies fail very frequently. Because it takes a lot of factors going right and getting lucky for something to become popular. Even if it’s a good final product it still might not become popular. Why Reels won’t compete with TikTok.

That’s why Reels is integrated with Instagram. Which in my opinion is incredibly stupid in the long run because it dilutes both products. But FB knows otherwise it would have flunked immediately. Now they can say Instagram users are reels users as well. Even though reels feels incredibly rushed just to capitalize on Tiktok uncertainty which is gone now that Trump is actually going to force the sale essentially.

TL;DR: FB chasing trends is bad long term for the company and the stock, and MSFT is going to have a cash cow on their hands with TikTok."

If we have runaway inflation, oil and precious metals are not going to stop going up. Make sure you don’t get left in the inflation underworld completely tendie-less. Your paper dollar gains in AMZN or TSLA will mean nothing.

**If everyone buying gold right now is wrong what’s the worst that can happen?** 

Maybe you lose a little money here or there. That’s it. 

If precious metals collapse/backfire, it means we are back to steady bull market growth and a healthy economy that pays handsomely. Either way you’ll have more tendies in the future. 

**Don’t just look at this as a meme stock.** 

It’s not. Real people are going to be completely wiped out and standing in bread lines if this shit gets off the ground too much. Karma always comes back around. Don’t be the guy that has to buy silver at $50 or gold at $3000 to preserve the last of his dying dollars.

Maybe you don’t have tons of money to save from inflation. Fair enough. Tell your parents and grandparents."

CWH has been doing very well last couple months, went down today 20% while they beat revenue estimates. Up 1.5% in AH.

FSLY is another one down 18% AH. I know Tiktok is their biggest customer but SHOP is also one of their customers and they have been on a tear this year [https://www.fastly.com/customers/shopify](https://www.fastly.com/customers/shopify).

If they hold up a stimulus package, it puts a potential Biden presidency in a bad position and also sets them up to reflip the House and Senate in 2022 if they lose it. They'll be trading losing the Senate majority to own all of Congress at a later date.

The White House will issue executive orders to bypass congress for piecemeal stimulus implementation, which will probably be held up by Congress (mainly the democrats). Either outcome is good for Trump. If the executive orders go through without opposition, he's a hero because he gave the people stimulus. If they have opposition and are halted, it makes Congress look bad for stealing stimulus from the hands of the people."

*Each Apple shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020 will receive three additional shares for every share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020*

If I own 1 share, I get 3 more shares on august 24th, correct? Then what does August 31st mean for me and what happens during the 7 days inbetween? Tried googling things but maybe I just don't know what to google

Edit: AAPL 8/21 500c and 1 whole share"

2020-08-06 21:07:56,FrancisCharlesBacon,4,"20GB leak/hack of **Intel** data today: whole Git repositories, dev tools, backdoor mentions. More leaks threatened to come. 

>Per our analysis, the leaked files contained Intel intellectual property respective to the internal design of various chipsets. The files contained technical specs, product guides, and manuals for CPUs dating back to 2016. The leaked contents also contain BIOS information and source code of proprietary Intel technology that could be used in building malware. BIOS code for Kabylake and other processors could mean trouble for those users if hackers find ways to manipulate the code and get it installed on target computers. Perhaps the most damaging is the tools and firmware for the Tiger Lake platform, which could lead to malware before the product ever comes to market.

Intel's full statement is below:

>""We are investigating this situation. The information appears to come from the Intel Resource and Design Center, which hosts non-public NDA information for use by our customers, partners and other external parties who have registered for access. We believe an individual with access downloaded and shared this data.""

However, ZDNet has also received a copy of the conversation between Kottmann and his source, conversation in which the alleged hacker claimed to have obtained the data via an unsecured server hosted on the Akamai CDN, and not by using an account on the Intel Resource and Design Center.
