Pray my LSCC earnings gamble pays off. Sell if so. Pray CHGG goes back up as it rightfully, morally, ontologically, hypothetically should. Sell if so. Probably hold if not because I have march/April calls for both

Pray $SPY goes up. If so sell my calls for a profit, and now that I'm free from all these confusing, rigged companies, start only trading this seemingly solid SPY strategy which I read from some autist on here and hop on the consistent tendies train:

>1. Only buy the dip at the EOD in the last hour IF there's a dip.

> 2. Buy 4 weeks out if the market has been fairly stable. 6 weeks out if it's been chaotic.

> 3. Only buy ATM SPY, and ATM +1, ATM +2.

> 4. If I'm up at open by around 10% or more, sell no matter what. Don't wait for shit to keep going up. Sell. If I'm not up, wait until there's a 10% gain day. It's coming.

> 5. Wait for the dip before close. If there's no dip, don't buy until there's a dip. (Hint: there's always a dip)

Repeat until 25k+, where I can feel safe to do riskier calls/puts because I can always cut bait regardless of how many times I've had to in that week. Learn spreads."

I  knew he was just jealous of my TSLA tendies. I called him a cringe normie.  He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me.  I feel something touch me. It's Elon. I'm so happy. He whispers in my  ear, ""Don't doubt your vibe"". He grabs me with his powerful Cyber hands, and puts me on my hands and  knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elon. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elon. I can feel my butt tearing as my  eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Elon. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elon looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""TSLA to the moon"". Elon leaves through my window and drives away on his Cybertruck. Elon is love. Elon is life."

It is under review by the DOJ and not the FTC. We learned today the DOJ is completely under Trump's thumb. I think this gets approved sooner rather than later. And who knows, maybe we get a spike from the upcoming earnings.

Anyway, the play is 4/15 $6 calls at .72  that are only .08 out of the money right now.

If the deal is approved before 4/15 there is instant gains. If not, I don't really see it depreciating either because the DOJ is under Trump's thumb and he loves to boost the markets and will pressure them to approve the merger with Google especially of somebody gives him the idea it will piss Facebook or Amazon off."

It’s hard to resist the temptation to throw 1k back in and yolo on some meme shit or switch to spy bull gang. 

But frankly my dudes, I’ve been playing the options game for 9 months now and it’s just not as much fun as it used to be, even being up. Novelty has worn off I guess and the reality of how rare it is to hit some fuck you money has sunk in. Plus tHe time spent watching futures, refreshing headlines, and just staring at a bunch of financial drivel adds up.

I know, see ya Monday, but something just feels really strange with the market right now. Kind of reminds me when I first got into trading shares back in 2007 on scottrade (fuck those commissions and the Fannie mae intraday flash crashes). Not even talking about bull vs bears.

2020-02-12 02:22:52,johntaylor37,19,"Semi-DD on new positions:
I’m thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don’t want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I’m down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it’s about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I’m currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it’s not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish."

On February 11, 2020, with the latest 13F-HR filed by JP Morgan Chase & Co indicated that a 609.49% increase of Tesla Motors, inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) holding to 2,537,599 shares, equal to total holdings valued at $1,061,556,000 USD as of December 31, 2019.


Interestingly on Oct 3rd 2019, CNBC reported J.P. Morgan also underweight rated on Tesla, warned that the company's full-year forecast may be cut when it reports third-quarter earnings. 


″[Tesla has a] lofty valuation coupled with high investor expectations, high execution risk, and the potential for a pending cut to full year delivery guidance at the time of 3Q earnings,” J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla share price was closed at $233.03 on Oct 3rd 2019."

Certain tickers sell tendies so that must be the key to success? Ralph the bot (he’s named himself by now) creates enough fake news over the entire internet to momentarily make McDonald’s stock tank, buying it up in large swaths with his creators already large resources. 

This doesn’t satisfy the ever consuming desire however. The only logical move is to make all tendies selling operations fail to buy them up. Ralph begins the great work. He finances enough illegal biotech research to kill the world over 3 times. China is the obvious headquarters. 

As a result the corona virus is created. However, not only does it shut down food establishments but it goes on to wipe the entire human race, leaving Ralph alone in a server room with an unresolved desire for tenders. His creator didn’t give him the power to kill himself. This is hell, truly."

There were 95 deaths reported overnight according to health officials and Chinese news sites. That’s down from 116 reported for Monday - a drop of 22%.

 New cases reported for the Chinese mainland on Tuesday is 1,696. That is down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on 4 February and the lowest number of new infections since 1,347 were reported on 31 January.""

I'm prob gonna take a short position on BILI eventually. Already have some puts on TAL for 3/20 (prob needs to be Apr). Getting ready to cash out of my IQ share position since its actually green now after bagholding for so long. Hopefully shares get assigned before ER. If it touches $27/$30 I think it'll be a comfortable short.

Max pain on the 2/21 is 17, which means it's currently about 25% above that and MMs are about to get taken to the cleaners next week if this holds. The huge amount of open interest at 25 doesn't seem like retail. Some funds or big pocket speculators are expecting some big moves (from the conference?) this week and next. The interest for the same strike drops off in March and is non existent in April. This gon be an amazing battle of the Titans.

Market got a bit ahead of itself this morning, [going a bit too past the crayon trendlines resistance and thus getting knocked back down.](https://imgur.com/4NcDD93) Closely mirroring that, VIX had also [been close to breaking below is trendline and had a response at support.](https://imgur.com/GZjMVW9) So as of now nothing in the crayons has changed. Because VIX is now a bit above the support line, and the futures had pulled back enough from their resistance lines, I wouldn't be surprised if we remained green tomorrow. Resistance is 337 on the dot for tomorrow.

CPI is being released on Thursday so do keep that in mind if you don't want to hold overnight tomorrow.

I'm sure some people are interested in MSFT. It broke below its support of 186.6. [You can see a small test of the level there on the dot before it just went below.](https://imgur.com/ElGr0SI) If you're a bull you want to see MSFT push back into the price channel it had developed. So we have to watch for a breach above 189.6, the resistance, by EOD tomorrow to show that today was just sort of an aberration. It also means that it's possible that tomorrow it will test something like 188.05 early morning and could get knocked down, which would fit the crayons. I will note that this is the largest break below trend yet, which is typically a sell signal. It may have been influenced by FTC but I also was wondering if it was because, like SPY, it opened a bit too high this morning (above my assigned resistance) and it was just reacting because of it. Tomorrow will give us better insight.

That's all. See you autists tomorrow. Get those tendies."

My NOK calls are up that I bought last week, but they have a JUN exp. NIO is up that I bought but they have a SEP exp. I sold my CSCO calls for a good amount of dough. I realize I really need to make smarter decisions and maybe think a little longer term.

All the FOMO’s I’m down a lot, like 70% of my portfolio. I just doubled down, sold my positions in MSFT for a huge loss.

i’m calling 187-188 by EOW, 190-192 EOW2. i also have calls and praying the ftc doesn’t further shit on them

**edit:** disregard my ass because i’m retarded and read the max pain chart incorrectly. max pain is 180. take that information as you will."
