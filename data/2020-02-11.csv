Pray my LSCC earnings gamble pays off. Sell if so. Pray CHGG goes back up as it rightfully, morally, ontologically, hypothetically should. Sell if so. Probably hold if not because I have march/April calls for both

Pray $SPY goes up. If so sell my calls for a profit, and now that I'm free from all these confusing, rigged companies, start only trading this seemingly solid SPY strategy which I read from some autist on here and hop on the consistent tendies train:

>1. Only buy the dip at the EOD in the last hour IF there's a dip.

> 2. Buy 4 weeks out if the market has been fairly stable. 6 weeks out if it's been chaotic.

> 3. Only buy ATM SPY, and ATM +1, ATM +2.

> 4. If I'm up at open by around 10% or more, sell no matter what. Don't wait for shit to keep going up. Sell. If I'm not up, wait until there's a 10% gain day. It's coming.

> 5. Wait for the dip before close. If there's no dip, don't buy until there's a dip. (Hint: there's always a dip)

Repeat until 25k+, where I can feel safe to do riskier calls/puts because I can always cut bait regardless of how many times I've had to in that week. Learn spreads."
