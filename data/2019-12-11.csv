""If you listen carefully, you will hear the sound of a crooked foundation known as marijuana prohibition starting to crumble in the United States. It has been more than eight decades since the federal government outlawed the cannabis plant nationwide, and yet, here we are finally standing on its lawn with torches in hand waiting for a day of reckoning.

Because no matter how much the suits on the Hill have schemed to enslave a population through backasswards drug laws, the nation has risen up in true knock-down-drag-out fashion and fought for its freedom back. Admittedly, this battle for legal bud took a lot longer than it should have, but considering that everyone in the trenches was stoned beyond belief, the marijuana movement seems to be arriving right on time."""

Face-ripping SPY rallies are over this year unless we roll down to SPY 303 before EOY, but if that happens it will likely be a dead cat bounce that drops in early Jan. When Trump delays tariffs before Sunday, it might seem a good time to go long, but volatility will reign as the admin will say they‚Äôll charge them retroactively on X date. And China has been docile, but don‚Äôt bet on it staying that way for much longer. Play volatility and go hard on SPY calls if we hit SPY 303 before EOY to flip.

When headwinds increase in Q1 2020 after a juicy drop that gets bought up on a continuation of trade deal hopes and real expectations for another early cut with a continuation of Fed repo policy, prepare for headlines like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have made 6% in 3 MONTHS if you bought the January drop, are you fuckin‚Äô STUPID?‚Äù We have plenty of time (months) to stay around or above SPY 300 before the earnings recession gets fully-realized.

12/11/2019  


today was cool, I reflected on my bad trades of the last quarter (almost all losses). I made the decision to start winning, I'm aware it's a bold move however simple.  
Today marks the day that we all begin to win.  
Bears and Bulls alike, sharing beers and watching their accounts rocket to sky high never before seen levels.  


I have the night off from my second job, and a RH account with instant transfers locked; PDT as well.  
The dark triad.  
Otherwise today was uneventful in my trading prospects, besides being down $400 in CORV.  


If you've been having a losing streak, it's as simple as deciding to start winning.

2019-12-11 21:12:15,inverseerino,7,"no rate hikes in 2020, maybe one in 2021 says FED.

in 2021 FED will say ""the economy is slowing down so much we need to cut the rates again""

in 2022 it will be ""still need more rate cuts because last rate cuts didnt get the economy going""

2023 will be worst stockmarket crash in history."

2019-12-11 21:09:52,OriginalFluff,12,"**Today:**

(1) Buy $265c for LULU expiring this week. No way in tits it makes money even with good earnings

**Tomorrow:**

(2) Sell in morning regardless of what happens. It's just money. Up or down who cares life stays the same

(3) If LULU goes up, cool I got free lunch.

(4) If LULU goes down, cool I can enter a dope-ass stock for a slight discount because this brand isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 

**Once finished:**

(5) Speculate on other stocks"
