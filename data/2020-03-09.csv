G - Google

I - It

R - Retard

L - Loser

Alas, it‚Äôs still far from a Turnaround Tuesday, as it will be tough for the SPX to recover all of the rout of the previous three trading days -- oil remains depressed, volatility‚Äôs high, and today‚Äôs planned unveiling of a White House economic aid package holds risk aplenty."

From April 1, Aramco will offer customers 12.3m barrels of oil per day, up from 10m bpd previously, it says.

This is confirmation that Saudi Arabia is launching a price war against rivals, after Russia refused to back Opec‚Äôs proposed output cuts last week. That move was a major cause of Monday‚Äôs rout.

That‚Äôs 300,000 barrels per day MORE than Aramco‚Äôs ‚Äòmaximum sustained capacity‚Äô -- implying that Saudi authorities plan to reduce their own oil reserves, to fuel the price war (having already driven the price down 20% yesterday).""

2020-03-10 05:43:23,zg44,26,"Remember that it's perfectly natural to have 3+% up days during a bear market, as stated many times virtually all of the biggest one day up moves in history have happened during bear markets.

Bear markets have extreme volatility, markets will move up and down in extreme fashion until a bottom is found.  I happen to think that we aren't at the bottom yet and will likely see a test of S&P 2715 (the 20% decline level on S&P).

That's based on the notion that the US has fallen too far behind on coronavirus to really halt the spread of it without massive shutdowns of major cities and a significant halt to business activity that sends us into a technical recession of sorts.

Could that be avoided? Yes, if Trump/Congress announce big fiscal stimulus plans and coronavirus ends up not impacting the US as hard as expected.

But keep in mind that on non-news days, we're likely to see sharp upward moves that get sold off on bad coronavirus news days until we find a bottom.  That's the point at which markets will buy no matter how bad the news is, and that's when it's safest to buy long.  It still feels early for that by about 2-3 weeks.

This is why it's essential to take profits where you can if you're trying to play bounces; there are many sharp dead cat bounces during bear markets.  You can profit on either side of the trade as long as you don't get too greedy."

Buy calls when -% hits day low then stabilizes for an hour then goes back to day low.

Buy puts when +% hits day high then stabilizes for an hour then goes back to day high.

sell calls when +% hits day high then stabilizes for an hour then goes back to day high.

sell puts when -% hits day low then stabilizes for an hour then goes back to day low.

TUP calls and even some shares - they're at 1.25 p/e which is insane. They currently hold more cash than the companies entire valuation.

--------------

I'll sell some of these when the market's spiking, idk if tomorrow or the day after, eventually move into more wynn puts + puts on brazil and italy and... Whatever has a low iv really. More virt perhaps. I'll hold the oil calls at least a month though."

At the end of a major bull market, bears may very well be ridiculed (recall how forecasts for a top in the stock market during 2000 were received)."

Sold bull credit spreads on UVXY at nice profits.  Then Wednesday comes,  I sold bearish credit spreads way OTM on spy but the freakin fake rally got close to position and exited with small loss.

Then I switched to bull gang and sold way otm credit spreads on msft 155 / 152.50.   I made it out Ok at profit although I got too close for comfort.  I then realized that the trend has definitely reversed.  We were conditioned to Buy the dip.   I should have kept it simple Thursday and Friday and bought naked puts which I havent done in a long time.   IMHO, these are the best times to buy naked options and its probably only one of the best times.  Otherwise, theta fucks you up in quiet times.

On a side note,  theta gang is awesome as you can still make money or take a very small loss even if you are very wrong about direction."

You think they wouldnt crash the market after seeing the influx of new users here? Sell you inflated puts at nice round numbers than snatch it all away.

Futures down 4%, green by morning with nothing but a tweet ""all is well"", that's it. Bears foaming at the mouth for Iranian retaliation. Nothing happened ath's the next day. Trade war with china?

You see the bull run is unstoppable, let me know when the US runs out of energy to power the printers and maybe I'll join bear gang. Until then just move the calls further out.

In other news from Europe:
1) Companies have started banning all business travel as far out as May.
2) Handshaking is no longer an acceptable greeting (elbow bumps have become a common go to) and this is being advised to employees by their employers.
3) Students who returned from Italy in the past two weeks must self quarantine for 14 days or face expulsion from University.

Most companies have started asking employees to take laptops home with them every night in case of an immediate intra city travel ban. In the meantime, employees who can are being asked to work from home and avoid traveling on public transportation where possible.

Most supermarkets are now out of:
Hand soap
Toilet paper
Pasta
Rice

TLDR: Since 1993, all the gains that the market has seen have been during overnight trading. During actual market hours (9:30 - 4PM), the market is actually 4.4% down since 1993.

So generally, overnight trading tends to be bullish, while market hour trading usually leads to sideways trading or selling."

[https://i.imgur.com/7dSfQDU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7dSfQDU.jpg)

So back in 2018, the day we dipped into ""bear market"" territory (20% drop from 52-week high), was actually a signal for the bottom. The next day, we made new lows before reversing higher and continued to climb.

Right now, S&P needs to close below 2725 on the daily to be in a bear market. We have already traded below that level, we just don't have a closing candle below it yet.

Anyhow, the point that I am making is that it might be smart to be a bit lighter on puts/shorts for the next few days. Best to see how the market trades once it is well into the bear market."

CCL 3/20 $22p

GUSH 3/20 $5p

HAL 4/17 $10p

AMD 5/15 $25p (Gaining slightly. I don't expect much more than it's given.)

SIX 9/18 $12.5p

BAC 12/18 $15p

GUSH 01/15 $20c (because people HAVE To bitch about the price of gas, or the market has failed...and it was like $30/contract for calls)

No way I'm riding most of that shit anywhere close to expiry, but at least time-decay's on my side for the long ones. Why'd I take out a put on both HAL and GUSH? Because fuck HAL, that's why. Anyway, I think most of this should be able to whimper back down even if SPY makes a bullshit recovery rally this week. I'm fucking drooling over SIX because it's going to eat shit on QE because things are batty, and they're facing a lawsuit.) Closing all the 3/20's by EOW if they gain, or giving them a second chance next week if they're losing. Not big enough to worry about cutting losses.

2020-03-09 23:34:38,TimAppleBurner,10,"Two things that are funny to me today.

1) in Trump‚Äôs attempts to assuage corona virus fears, he quotes flu sickness numbers, and then says of the 500+ people with the illness only 22 have died. Clearly this is an easy calculation, a 4% death rate, not something insignificant. He just openly quotes this number and doesn‚Äôt even realize what he‚Äôs saying. 

2) after a massive down day, now trump has to use one final ultimate card: tax cuts. He‚Äôs been hinting at it some, but now he wants to super cut taxes, and lower interest rates thereby giving a complete fuck you to the national debt, but at least the market may be on its way to recovery (at least in his mind)."

Mass  gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed. Public health and  healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of  hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law  enforcement, emergency medical services, and sectors of the  transportation industry may also be affected. Healthcare providers and  hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to  protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it."

2020-03-09 23:05:00,stashua123,9,"Recap and the implications of today's moves.

This is the second biggest percentage drop in markets since the 1987 Stock Market crash, behind the October 2008 crash. (excluding Nasdaq in 2000)

This was the eleventh biggest percentage drop in the Dow Jones since its inception, behind 7/21/1933's 7.84%.

This was the tenth worst percentage drop in history for the Nasdaq index and its biggest point drop ever.

This was the sevententh worst percentage drop in history for the S&P 500, and its biggest point drop ever.

This was Crude Oil's second worst percentage day on record, down 25%.

This is no August 2011, August 2015- February 16 or December 2018. This is something different on a whole different magnitude.

Todays moves were comparable to 2008. 

Prediction

The US is either entering or in a Recession. Will not be as bad as 2008, I am thinking unemployment rate will peak at 7-8%, so I would call it a moderate recession. Not too severe, not too mild. Recessions happen. They come with their own risks and rewards, take advantage of it. We will get out of it by Q1 2021."

Payroll tax cuts

Institute Mandatory Quarantine for those with confirmed cases. Self for others been in contact. Tax cuts or stimulus for those businesses so they don‚Äôt suffer too much. Felony for those who break either quarantine. 

Suspend foreign travel to high risk countries for 6 months.

Send the majority of tests and supplies to nursing homes or retirement communities. Do a 100% testing of them and the workers. 

Reduce tax burden for options trading.

Inject stimulus in RH so they can program an app correctly.

Introduce new longer bonds.

Stimulus/Freeze 401k losses so they literally can‚Äôt go tits up.!

Declare war on the European Union/Middle East and get all their Gold and Oil to pay off our national debt.

We're intubating everyone but it's already starting to overwhelm us and we have no idea what's about to happen. Today, half my patient list was 'covid covid covid'. It's grim. I asked my wife to go away till this blows over bc I'm scared. Ppl can talk shit but they don't see 30/40 year olds on vents.

* Remdesivir (Ebola drug)
* Arbidol (Flu drug)
* Rotonavir (HIV drug)
* Favipiravir (RNA-Antiviral)
* Lopinavir (HIV drug)
* Tocilizumab (Arthritis drug)
* Chloroquine (Malaria drug)
* Ciclesonide (Asthma drug)
* Plasma therapy (Antibody donation)


#Note

Many of these drugs are **already approved for human use**, just not treatment of covid. Once the efficacy is documented they can then be used. NOT TO BE CONFLATED with the timeline of a scratch drug or vaccine, which is months-years.

Some of them target the virus itself, some of them are treating the pneumonia (the part responsible for the mortality rate).

Bears be careful, the biological weight of the drop is hard to quantify. The whiplash caused by a surge in treatment headlines if the trials are successful will see that factor lift from the market. The severity of the rally is unknown, don't get comfortable."
