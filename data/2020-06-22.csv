So here is what I thought.  We are not talking about margin, we are not talking borrowing money.

We are talking an IRA.  Rules are different.

Here is what I thought.

If I have a 100 shares, I can sell a call.  I then receive money and with that money I buy fractional shares of that stock. Lowering my basis.  A good stock like $SPY is nice to do this on.

I thought when I have zero money to trade. Not talking about margin.  Cash available to trade Zero.

I thought whelp that's it. I must wait till my calls either are exercised or expire worthless , allowing me to re-sell a call.

I was actually pretty sure of this.  

Actually I was 100% wrong.  

In a non margin-able account, with zero cash available , you know what I allowed to do.

Sell another call, buy back my original so long as a credit spread or cash for me difference.

I can do this all day.

Effectively trading on a limited margin all day long.

Whelp. I need a lot more frozen spring rolls from DollarTree, cause my computer is gonna get a workout today bro.

>""In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other."" [Trade truce deal, article 7.6](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)  
>  
>China no longer needed to buy $200BNs of American goods.  
>  
>China: 1 - US: 0

I have posted this about 2-3 months ago and now US finally woke up:

>White House adviser Navarro says China trade deal is “over”. Says the ""turning point"" came when the US the learned about the spreading coronavirus only after a Chinese delegation had left Washington following the signing of the Phase 1 deal on Jan. 15. - CNBC

LMAO, that is an early response."
2020-06-23 09:35:06,one_eyed_johnny,2,Picture this: you've got  350 spy calls expiring this Friday. On your walk down the street this morning a cop stops you. Says you smell like weed. He then whips out the ol k9 and they find the roach in your pocket. Uhoh. Spend a week or so in jail  and when you get out Saturday you see that spy hit 360 on Friday over a Rona cure and drilled back to 310 as it was quickly exposed. You proceed to cry in the shower for 3 hours.

BRRRRRR money goes to bonds that go to zombie companies that sell shit products at inflated prices. They sell less gizmos and services, but the Fed will keep them going with ever growing debt.

#Personal bias suggest that we will be trading from 310 - 315 range today with a view to load long position each time spy gives an entry in 310ish range with a tendency to take that position overnight


Spy continues to to trend upwards thus bearish bets are off the table untill clear rejection of 320


Consolidation was noticed each time nasdaq touched 10k, consolidation zone was 9500 - 10000, charts are indicating that consolidation is over and a new up move is on the cards, this is one of the prime reason for taking long position overnight as 10000 has turned it to become psychological support, this may help in holding all other indices 


#____________________



Long term : as usual, major indices are on uptrend with vix making new lows on long charts this the recommendation stays the same, go long using it SIP strategy to benefit the current volatility

IMF WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JUNE 2020Wednesday, June 24, 2020, 9:00am ET

[https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020)

Mark your calendars. IMF is gonna fuck the markets up on June 24. Sneak peek to the report:

>IMF set to slash economic forecasts and warns of a crisis ‘unlike anything the world has seen’. The real economy is hit hard. We will release a new forecast on the 24 th of June and expect it to reflect the extremely challenging conditions. In April, we projected minus 3 percent for global growth in 2020. We are likely to revise downward further on the basis of incoming data, which tells us that most countries are doing worse than we had projected.

**(CNN)**The US Secret Service on Monday evening told members of [the White House press corps](https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/white-house) to immediately leave the White House grounds, a highly unusual decision that did not immediately come with an explanation.

The decision came during an ongoing demonstration in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House where protesters were trying to bring down a statue of former President Andrew Jackson that stands in the middle of the park. Those protesters were eventually pushed back out of the park by police.Protesters spray painted ""BHAZ"" on the pillars of St. John's Episcopal Church, which sits across the street from Lafayette Square. The acronym stands for ""Black House Autonomous Zone,"" an apparent reference to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in Seattle where protesters have taken over a six-square-block area of the city and kept out police in order to set up their own self-governing space."

*Don't be a bull, don;t be a bear: Be a predator. constantly lurking and stalking the ""easy prey"".*

*Perma bulls and perma bulls are dangerous, lazy and arrogant. Don't take their views too seriously if you care about YOUR account.*

*It's not about being 'bullish' or 'bearish'. It's about being RIGHT. Please understand this. It's vital to long term survival.*

*Economy could be in recession but if the market is rallying, you need to listen to the market. It pays better.*"

Trump is not dumb. He knows he’s toast in November if the economy doesn’t recover and markets tank. This is priority number one. 

If you think otherwise you are delusional.

There are issues that can benefit him politically. Standing up against China is one of those issues. Public opinion among most democrats and republicans is not pro China. Pretty bipartisan issue.

Reality is that the risk of tanking the market is too high if he takes that approach.

Would NOT be surprised if this was an intentional move to test the market’s reaction. Clearly it was not good.

HIGHLY unlikely Navarro would let something like that “accidentally” slip. 

Even more unlikely it would get retracted so quickly. Seems pretty coordinated. It was also done when markets are closed to limit to potential unintended consequences.

Sometimes a few pajama traders need to be sacrificed for the benefit of the market as a whole."

We had a 6% drop, a small recovery, then flat ever since. The result is that spy is down about 4% over the past couple of weeks.


If you're a bear and you had puts before the drop, you printed.

If you're a bull and you bought calls after the drop, you printed.

If you're a bear and you bought puts after the drop, you're fucked.

If you're a bull and you bought calls before the drop, you're fucked.


It's that simple. The past 2 weeks is not a clear bull or bear victory, both got super fucked depending on entry timing.

And, this flatness is killing both of us, and you know it.

So, can to bulls slow down on the ""imagine buying puts bears are absolutely retarded stonks go up bbbrrrrrr"" spam when we all know that both sides are bleeding?

- Trade deal being canceled would have strengthened the US dollar (relative to other currencies)

A drop like that was the big MMs exiting their positions, not just some overzealous algos. 

And you'd be naive as fuck to not believe that they have insiders in Washington. If the trade deal is actually over, they knew about it days/weeks ago. And if it isn't, they knew Navarro was full of shit.

That was a coordinated exit, based on something we don't know yet. Or, they wanted to use the news to cause a panic sell-off and buy back in lower.

Regardless, the big boys are playing 5D chess, and to say that they have more information than you would be the understatement of the decade. Thinking the market actually dropped like that due to a fox News segment is ridiculous."

As soon as that stopped the selling calmed down and everyone happily bought the dip.  Now we will see if the selling continues.  I don’t think it will.  It was an over reaction.

2020-06-23 01:47:56,,2,"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that the Trump administration is preparing for a second wave of coronavirus infections.

""We are filling the stockpile in anticipation of a possible problem in the fall. We are doing everything we can beneath the surface, working as hard as we possibly can,"" Mr. Navarro told CNN. ""You prepare -- you prepare for what can possibly happen. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but of course you prepare.""

In a statement later, Mr. Navarro said: ""We don't necessarily expect a second wave but prudence dictates that we plan for it. There is no contradiction.""

There have been 2,269,463 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and 119,868 deaths, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University. Among U.S. states, coronavirus infections are growing fastest in Arizona, South Carolina, Florida and Texas, according to Johns Hopkins."

First his “largest rally ever” was a giant failure and the media made him look like a fool.

Now he has to act like a big strong man and get some kinda proper attention.

What better than to restart shit with China? Most Americans love that right? Also with stock market near all time high, as they say, he definitely has some ammo to play with... it will be interesting to see what the Fed comes out and does... Trump may actually cause some serious permanent damage if he restarts shit in middle of a pandemic and depression."

2020-06-23 00:53:42,IAmConsidering,-11,"Advice needed

Ok so I need some help. I'm 18, just graduated high school. I recently traveled across the country to meet this girl, we both lost our virginities. I never have hung out with anyone before that, I never leave the house, I have no friends. I told my parents I was going on a graduation trip with some friends (I dont have any lol), they were worried but were ok with it since I was paying for it and everything (I've made a lot of tendies). I left Thursday to go, I met the girl, we hung out, cuddled, had sex, shopped, etc. It was one of the best times of my life. I left yesterday to head back home. Now she wants me to come back in a few weeks and meet her dad, she told him about me, how I do stocks, and how I'm a really sweet guy and a dork, but not that I was just there. He seems ok with it if he oks me, I think he would. I would like to go back, but I'm not sure how.

I got some options I've been thinking about

Option 1
Tell my parents that the friends want me to go with them on another trip, this time to say, Miami (I went to Charleston). 
The issue for this would be if they wanted to see my flights, and they might not like me going
Pros for it is that they wouldn't know about her

Option 2
Tell her I met a girl Saturday and that she wants me to go back to visit her
The issue, I've only have had 1 girlfriend before and I feel like it would be really awkward talking about it and they might get upset that I would spend money to get there and money there, they think I'm wasting my money(I have 6x as much in my long portfolio as their savings account has, and I wont touch that) 
Also they wouldn't think that just meeting the girl would be a good idea to go back to Charleston 
Pros, it's partly the truth, and it wouldn't involve much lying

Option 3 
Tell them I met a girl a couple months ago online and I visited her this  weekend
The issue, they would be upset I lied about the trip and the issues with option 2 apply here
Pros, it's 100% the truth

Ik WSB isn't the place for this, but I have no friends and need advice"

I’m your host, Namsilat.  Below are a few definitions to help you understand what’s going on if you’re new here.  Each of these definitions was taken from an actual sighting on today’s discussion thread.

**Mooning** - A .6% increase in a five minute candle, after the stock had dropped 13% that day.

**Drilling** A .4% decrease in a five minute candle, after the stock had increased 9% that day.

**Bears are fuk** An evening in which futures rose so much the the market only opened 30 points down.

**Bulls are fuk** An evening in which futures point to a loss the next day after 15 minutes of open.

**Kang Gang** A group of 14 year olds who would be day traders if they had more than $50 dollars to throw at a 70% OTM position on a stock for a company that has already gone bankrupt.

**Stonks only go up** Uttered fervently by many thousand retards when the market has been in a downtrend for 2 weeks.

**FD** A delightful feast of tossed salad in a corn dressing with slivered fermented nuts.

**Next stop...** the next number after the number the stock is currently at.

**Theta** An intestinal parasite found in the large colon of several bloodsucking eels

**Up 200%!** Up 40% in unrealized gains, portfolio down 70% all time in realized losses.

**Printer goes BRR** Asian markets have opened up.

**Europoors** People trading in a market being destroyed by the unplanned exit of one of the largest economies from their federation.

**Shares** A great mystery, nobody knows."

This 1.5 wave/ 2nd wave/ whatever you call it, will be 10-12 states? 

Second peak death and cases will surely pass first peak, which people won’t like looking at.

Also, before one of you fucks says, “DEATHS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE DOWN” first, both are lagging indicators. The 4K Florida cases will see their toughest days around the 10th day. Oh, and hospitalizations are up. Arizona is approaching bed capacity in 5-7 days. 

Talk to anyone in healthcare in hot spot states, they’re desperately preparing with reconfiguring wards and makeshift icu beds. Too bad half the country won’t wear a mask and think it’s fake. 

If this happened in the beginning (Florida, TX, etc.) we would be freaking out because full capacity is not far off. Unfortunately, people are (rightfully) tired of the disease but it won’t stop and it will kill a lot."

2020-06-23 00:10:52,Hubers57,4,"So when I started end of March with 45k, my strategy was 90% share, 10% options (mostly dated at least a month out), reroll most profits into shares. Long term goal to accumulate as much as possible and switch to wheel theta gang next year to supplement income, cause wife graduates and will work but we have too many fucking kids and daycare is expensive so I mine as well not work for a couple years. Strategy worked great, got up 90%,but then that 5% drop really fucked me. Went from 85k to about 67k now.

So my question is, do I pull out of my shares to go full theta gang early, just start selling puts with cash collateral and turning around and selling covered calls when I get assigned? Or do I suck it up and take the options risk to build capital? Ideally a 100k minimum would be great for theta gang profits, but on the other hand I'm actually poor as fuck, the Midwest is cheap and what I got invested is like 2 years salary, and dropping back to 45k would be terribly disheartening. What's the best course of action?"

Presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon announced on Monday

After Trump's reelection campaign reportedly sought to alter the debate rules and dates, O'Malley Dillon described it as ""merely an effort to dodge fair, even-handed debates,"" and claimed that the US president is ""afraid of facing questions from a neutral moderator."""

Bailouts would’ve been more transparent and fair. Buying bonds they issue with little limitation? Absolutely crooked.

Fed says they’re buying at “market prices” too bad when you buy $7 trillion from the market, market “prices” ain’t market prices.

I also hate seeing Americans suffer while bulls here say, “PUTS ARE ANTI AMERICAN” you dumbass mother fuckers, Americans don’t benefit from this prop up. They pay for it. Oh, and before one of those dumb bulls say, “THEY HAVE 401ks!” Think of how little that is vs. hedge funds, endowments, pensions, etc.

Then there’s guys posting flat out false shit like NY and NJ had no deaths today, or false ICU bed numbers in Arizona.. are people that fucking scared about their calls that they’re going to make shit up like this?  Or is this some kind of an orchestrated campaign?  I have no clue, but it’s utterly fucking retarded."

We’ve hit the ceiling on too many blue chips and the Fed is looking for a way out. I don’t think the Fed stress test this week is about the cash banks have. I think it will be about how to shed responsibility of the recovery onto banks, which is not bullish for banks. I have made so much money riding the Fed’s coattails on SPY calls.

Spirit now expects to deliver only 72 shipsets to Boeing, which includes 37 shipsets to be produced and delivered over the rest of this year and 35 shipsets already delivered to Boeing, compared with 125 planned earlier.

Because of the production cuts, Spirit says it could breach the financial covenants under its credit agreement without an amendment or waiver."

Since market close on our recent high (June 8th), SPY has dropped from an average daily just over 312 to just over 306.  About 2%, or about .2% a day.

It looks like the downtrend is accelerating to me.  With the mean of the last 5 dropping faster than the mean of the last 10, and the mean of the last 2 dropping faster still.

Momentum being a good indicator of what's going to happen next, I think we're still going to trend down over the next week, but so slowly that volatility crush will fuck puts.

The funny thing is, our peak coincided exactly (like to the minute) with JPOW announcing the purchase of bonds by the FED.  It's as if the market was complaining about a broken arm and JPOW came in with a defibrillator and 3 nurses screaming about how many minutes we had to live."

Bulls: I'd consider buying some VXX call hedges just in case, maybe scale back any super OTM positions and roll them out further or bring the strike down

Bears: Don't put all your eggs in one basket, prepare to be wrong, hedge your bets and take profits if it's red because we could very easily bounce right back up Wednesday.

Seattle CHOPCHAZ zone is becoming more violent. Not as violent as Karens yet but potentially there can be homegrown terrorist attacks in US coming this summer. Hope not. Government must stop giving $1200 stimulus check payments because this money can be used for funding violence.

Mark your calendars. IMF is gonna fuck the markets up on June 24. Sneak peek to the report:

>IMF set to slash economic forecasts and warns of a crisis ‘unlike anything the world has seen’. The real economy is hit hard. We will release a new forecast on the 24 th of June and expect it to reflect the extremely challenging conditions. In April, we projected minus 3 percent for global growth in 2020. We are likely to revise downward further on the basis of incoming data, which tells us that most countries are doing worse than we had projected.

Next thing I know the sell wall has been removed/bought through. Well shit. It’s dipped back to 199.75 but it’s probably got room to run. Let’s sell a bull credit spread too, make a condor and limit my upside risk.

ESPO, IBUY, SKYY, ROBO.

If I had stuck with this strategy I would be up over 50% all time.

Instead what I did was pulled everything out in August of last year to day trade and swing trade options.

My all time is -0.67% and at one point I was down almost -50%.

At least I've had fun along the way. I hope the lessons I've learned and the trading knowledge I've acquired this year end up being net profitable. I'm viewing it as tuition for Tendie School. But the other part of me knows I should have just stuck with the original plan."
