So here is what I thought.  We are not talking about margin, we are not talking borrowing money.

We are talking an IRA.  Rules are different.

Here is what I thought.

If I have a 100 shares, I can sell a call.  I then receive money and with that money I buy fractional shares of that stock. Lowering my basis.  A good stock like $SPY is nice to do this on.

I thought when I have zero money to trade. Not talking about margin.  Cash available to trade Zero.

I thought whelp that's it. I must wait till my calls either are exercised or expire worthless , allowing me to re-sell a call.

I was actually pretty sure of this.  

Actually I was 100% wrong.  

In a non margin-able account, with zero cash available , you know what I allowed to do.

Sell another call, buy back my original so long as a credit spread or cash for me difference.

I can do this all day.

Effectively trading on a limited margin all day long.

Whelp. I need a lot more frozen spring rolls from DollarTree, cause my computer is gonna get a workout today bro.

2020-06-23 09:36:08,scopolamine,11,">In late November, the word had already gotten off of the mainland that there was a virus in Wuhan. Six weeks later, the trade truce was signed between US and China with an out clause, a very clever out clause:  
>  
>""In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other."" [Trade truce deal, article 7.6](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)  
>  
>China no longer needed to buy $200BNs of American goods.  
>  
>China: 1 - US: 0

I have posted this about 2-3 months ago and now US finally woke up:

>White House adviser Navarro says China trade deal is ‚Äúover‚Äù. Says the ""turning point"" came when the US the learned about the spreading coronavirus only after a Chinese delegation had left Washington following the signing of the Phase 1 deal on Jan. 15. - CNBC

LMAO, that is an early response."
2020-06-23 09:35:06,one_eyed_johnny,2,Picture this: you've got  350 spy calls expiring this Friday. On your walk down the street this morning a cop stops you. Says you smell like weed. He then whips out the ol k9 and they find the roach in your pocket. Uhoh. Spend a week or so in jail  and when you get out Saturday you see that spy hit 360 on Friday over a Rona cure and drilled back to 310 as it was quickly exposed. You proceed to cry in the shower for 3 hours.
