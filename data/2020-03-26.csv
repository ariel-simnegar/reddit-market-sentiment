**Week Ahead Economic Preview**

*Week of 30 March 2020*

**Content Summary:**

* Final PMI data will be keenly anticipated for the extent of the broader economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak around the world after flash PMI data showed business activity in major economies slumped in March. 
* China PMI updates in particular will be scrutinised for signs of recovery amid reports of an accelerated increase in the number of industrial firms resuming work.
* In the US, with the flash PMI reporting the steepest downturn since the global financial crisis during March, markets will look to forthcoming data, including non-farm payrolls, regional Fed surveys and the ISM PMI results for virus impact in March. They will also eye fresh developments on the massive fiscal stimulus plan that has now moved to a vote in the lower house on 27 March, after being unanimously approved by the Senate.
* In Europe, analysts will closely monitor upcoming data that include Euro area surveys on consumer and business confidence, while also eyeing any fresh policy responses to stem the negative COVID-19 impact on economic activity.
* In Asia, the March PMI updates will come on the heels of February numbers, which had indicated a much sharper contraction in Asian manufacturing output, primarily led by China.
* Singapore and India will decide on monetary policy, with both are widely expected to ease policy, joining the increasing number of countries launching significant monetary measures.
* Our special report this week investigate the economic impact of COVID-19 and its financial consequences for the commercial aviation industry across Asia-Pacific. (*For further highlights, see pages 6-8 of attached report*.)"

2020-03-27 06:57:46,TheNewKidOnTheStreet,31,"There's a recurring trend on the Internet where a community grows rapidly and then due to the influx of new posters (normies) there becomes a rift in the user base. Old users feel that the original greatness of the community has been lost. The community is no longer a small corner of the Internet where esoteric memes and references get passed around, but a website that even Aunt Karen has heard of. As the reputation of a community grows, the quality declines. Newer users want to get in on the action and become part of the 'club'. Except the club isn't so 'secret' anymore.

This phenomenon is a testament to us humans desire to be part of something exclusive. Thousands of websites have seen this happen. There's no doubt in my mind that this is occurring right now on WallStreetBets. The Daily Discussion and new threads are filled with idiots who never learned how to Google. From the mods perspective, all this new growth is a good thing. Who doesn't want their website to have more and more members? Especially when you can profit it off of it.

I don't blame /u/jartek and the mods for wanting to grow WallStreetBets or even try to profit off the success. But there are a lot better ways to go about making money off of a community, than a 3 day 'Esports' trading competition sponsored by some trading 'educational' group. Online trading 'educational' businesses are the opposite of this community and the YOLOs that made it great.

TLDR: I don't trust anyone trying to profit off of me. It's all too obvious the change in direction of this sub, where the mods look to profit off of the user base. This WallStreetBets Championship is the latest attempt.

Hospitals will get another round of stimulus if needed which will in turn pump the markets. Unlimited QE means banks and major financial institutions can keep snapping up cheap shares and get retail investors to FOMO in. I‚Äôm not sure more cases/deaths will be a strong enough catalyst to make new lows. 

So what is the likely catalyst? Will it be bad earnings reports causing individual stocks to drop? Will it be the oil prices collapse causing regional banks in TX and the Dakotas to fail? There is mortgage relief now for most folks so foreclosures don‚Äôt seem to be a huge threat. Corporate debt will get bailed out by the Fed. Will people continue to exercise social distancing for a few months causing restaurants/entertainment/retail to suffer? All of these seem like far from guaranteed given how stupid and cavalier the average American is. Curious to hear what you have to say. 

Oh, and pRiCeD iN."

US govt will be forced to foot the bill for emergency triage setup across the nation. if you're sick or injured from a non-covid illness? sorry, you're shit out of luck. on top of the deaths from covid many, many more will die due to inability to receive adequate care that they would have been able to receive in a non-pandemic situation. yes, that includes you random twenty something browsing reddit at 1 am.

oh and by the way? during a pandemic even *if* you're allowed to go outside, many people will be staying in and not spending for *months* if they decide to chance it and send us back out to the workforce. this alone would be enough to drive us into a recession. maybe we could've done something earlier, but the cat's out of the bag now.

someone's gonna be left holding the bomb that is trillions of stimulus debt, and regardless of who gets fucked over it will slam an already beaten down economy

the shortsightedness of bulls in here is honestly astonishing. although it is matched by the bears who can't understand that stocks go up during recessions, especially when the govt pumps out trillions of dollars of INFINITE QE. got DIS, BA, AAPL and some other assorted shit after we hit 220. started selling off yesterday and moving into SPXS. probably gonna be mostly SPXS by EOD Friday. see y'all at SPY 200 by May üòéüòé

Several states report over 1500 infections. No provence in China outside of Hubei had more than 1500. And we've got 8 cities that are doubling every 2 days with likely only 1 in 30 infections confirmed. Tests are still nowhere to be found unless you meet a strict criteria. And the ""free"" Healthcare promised for this only pays if you are confirmed, if you don't get a test, or test negative, you are on the hook for the Dr visit.

While I personally will make a crap ton of tendies when the market inevitably nosedives due to unprecedented loss of life, I can't help but weep for my fellow citizens of this country who are gonna be royally fucked in coming months.

Anyway. RCL announced the extension on 3/24. On 3/25 looks like their stock ended slightly up as the day rallied so I'm guessing this is already baked in."

That wasn‚Äôt the bottom. This isn‚Äôt the end. And I‚Äôd really love it if I was wrong, because this virus is real shit. I‚Äôm in a mild-high risk group of young people because I have asthma.

But this isn‚Äôt going away. I want it to go away. But it won‚Äôt. Not now. Not yet. 

So protect your goddamn portfolios. Don‚Äôt bet on this rally. A time may come when you actually need cash so don‚Äôt bet your entire account or most of it or even half of it.

The news will be talking about overrun hospitals, death, and lack of space to put bodies 24/7. This just now started hitting the news today, and the virus JUST picked up here.   


I know you will say it's ""Priced In"", but it's not. The imagery of these event's will finally begin to hit home in the middle of next week for US citizens. Once it hit's home with the US and becomes ""real"", it will then be ""Priced In"". If shit does not tighten up, we will also begin to see looting and crime rates sky rocket within the next three weeks.  


We will see green days tomorrow and likely into early next week. I would buy calls tomorrow beginning of the day...maybe even EOD. I think Monday has a chance of going green. I also think Tuesday could even be slightly green. However, by the end of the next week (at the latest), shit will start the final spiral to earth's core.

* last quarter sales still were made up 75% by in stores sales, all of which are closed in NA and Europe.  limited hours in China and AUs

* we got  virtual ""Sweat sesh'es"" going on, idk is this peloton type shit? 

* Supply chain completely fucked, but inventory could keep them afloat for a minute.

* STORE OPENING PLANS DRASTICALLY DECREASED, but hey, we continue to connect through communities online lmfao

* Q4 rev growth 20%, EPS 23% growth

* mens comps up 37%,

* 2023 vision, ""innovation"", something something, and ""online presence""

*  ""Our brand is strong, we'll be back after covid

* 54 new stores Q4

* 41% increase in online sales, 33% of total rev (this is contradictory to earlier numbers idk man, I'm trying to follow)

* 30% of income dedicated to operating costs

* 1.1B cash

* repurchased 1500 shares

* cannot provide guidance again, closed stores until April 5th

* China stores open, showing ""consistent traffic""

*dramatic slowdown, however, with store closures, lmfao

* reducing non essential expenses, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (read, new stores), and are refinancing debt

With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.

2020-03-26 23:18:16,nycliving1,5,"It honestly blows my mind that I've seen people here say that the last two days of the market have erased all their gains from the market. Isn't your trading approach fucked up when you can be ""right"" about the market for 3-4 weeks, and then two days of being ""wrong"" reverses the prior 3-4 weeks?

If you're risking your whole portfolio on each trade, obviously you're going to blow it up inevitably.

Heck, I am holding short positions myself right now, and yes, I am looking at losses, but it's a fraction of the bear gains that we all should have. Hell, when I got back into trading this past February, I loaded up $5k, took a quick beating of a few long trades since the markets finally started paying attention to the bear virus. I had $4k starting the first week of the correction, and since then, I've traded it up to $26k. (This Tuesday high)

Yesterday and today, I've been trying to chip into some short positions - unsuccessfully. But I'm not autistic enough to give up $21k in gains, as I am currently down $3k (11.5% loss)."

This type of upward move though (anything beyond S&P 2700+) still feels very premature though given that several states appear to be on NY's trajectory: NJ, Michigan, Louisiana, California, Mass., among others, and I'm just struggling to imagine that the US will avoid a second wave of infections given we haven't done a full lockdown.

How is the virus going to be eradicated in large parts of the US when there's no lockdown in play? Just tough for me to see unless there's a huge part of the population that's untested but has become immune due to catching it and showing no symptoms.  That's really the only way the bull case works out and we get a full V shaped recovery here.

But you have to be careful buying puts here; I don't think it's really worth trying to short against the tide, right now this rally has steam, and it will until the coronavirus numbers become too dire compared to what markets are hoping happens (some sort of partial re-open of the US by mid-April)."

It‚Äôll be in New York harbor but it was going through massive maintenance so it‚Äôll be there soon. Great people working to fix the ship. Great. But also in Los Angeles. There are two ships.

We will make it through this and I am taking all the necessary actions. We are taking strong leadership. I‚Äôm leading this and we are doing perfect. Great. We are doing perfectly great.

Now for some questions. You, you‚Äôre too close to the other guy there but I‚Äôll take your question.

What a ridiculous question. Does it make you feel good to be so nasty? Huh? I‚Äôm leading this and there are two ships going to help people. Two ships going to help Americans and Azzins. American Azzins. Great people. Really great people. Honest Americans not like reporters. So we are doing great things. Perfect things and I‚Äôm leading this.

‚ÄúMr. President, the fatality rates in New York have skyrocketed. Since you‚Äôre leading these efforts what are you doing for New Yorkers?‚Äù

This is a suckers rally in my opinion. But because many people have 4/17 puts there could be lots of sideways fuckery to drown those out before the real big dump.

**SPY $267 Call 4/15** (FOMO‚Äôd late into the bull ride hoping to catch it to \~$270 soon before the inevitable crash).

**VXX $50 Call 5/15** (i‚Äôm a rook when it comes to volatility plays. my thinking is when the market takes its impending tumble, fear and volatility will rise, thus VIX and VXX. I chose the same exp date as my SPY puts below).

**SPY $220 Put 5/15** (been bag-holding this position like a sucker. i‚Äôd be at ath if this play was calls instead of puts. oh well, coulda, shoulda, woulda. Either way i‚Äôm hoping by middle of May we fall bigly).

**GILD $85 Call 8/21/2020** (another amateur play. this is a pure speculator gamble on my part thinking Gilead is leading the race for the corona treatment/cure. Honestly, I should prolly sell out of this for a loss and look elsewhere - but i wanted to play one cure/treatment company during this time. Perhaps MRNA? GILD should be releasing some results in April, but I'm skeptical.)

**XOM $40 Call 1/15/2021** (i‚Äôm hoping OPEC+ will meet before the new year and come to an agreement. Exxon is trading near its book value. Feel good about these leaps.)

**BA $200 Call 1/21/2022** (this was a big L, now a huge W. Still holding bc these the exp are so far out and I‚Äôm confident BA can reach by then.)

**Any thoughts or ideas on my plays?** I‚Äôm hoping tomorrow is red, but fully expecting it to be green. My leaps and the short term SPY calls EOD that I yopped should hedge decently well for me, however, if we do open green. Still, I'm more concerned about the SPY puts and VXX calls."

this is the most obvious relief rally and bull trap. still so many delusional people who think everything goes back to normal soon. 

market was overvalued at 29,000. this type of crisis just doesn't crash to 22,000 and stay there or recover. this event is bigger than that. 

i'm predicting massive deflation followed by hyperinflation. stocks become worthless because everyone goes bankrupt. then the currency becomes worthless as the government sends everyone money (but there will be nothing to buy). too much money chasing too few goods."
