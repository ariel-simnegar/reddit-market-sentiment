2020-06-10 11:35:03,heartstesler,2,"Today at 2PM Jpow says  economy is recovering faster than expected and added 2.5M jobs in May 2020. There is no longer liquidity support is needed as economy is on recovery path and stock market has fully recovered even crossed ATH  of  Feb 2020 when US had best economy in the history of the world.

Fed job was to provide support in the interim from pandemic shock to path of recovery. 

Economic data‚Äôs are showing clear sign of recovery and additionally 2.5 M jobs were created further support strength of the recovery is robust. Further says that  no more liquidity support and QE needed as US economy is recovering faster than expected. 

And further says keeping interest rate low for now and will review if inflation target is achieved of 2% and will continue to monitor yield curve and data.


Then what will happen

Is above not true?

Will he not speak truth?

Why Jpow will not say when economy is showing faster recovery than expected as claimed by Trump and stock market showing this?

There is huge liquidity in the system even Trump administration is saying no more stimulus is needed.

What is going happen then after 2 pm

Treasury yield is already going up a per Wells Fargo 

Treasury yield comeback is real, and the 10-year could hit 1.5% within months, Wells Fargo says

It's dipping on news that the US military is delaying a contract decision with BA so  they fix a component on the tankers. It's not affecting current operations of the tankers.

2020-06-10 10:35:59,schnookiums,0,"Top story on drudge is increasing cerveza sickness, which the inherent gay bearness in me has noticed for the last couple weeks, particularly in freedom loving states like Texas, Arizona, Florida.  

Also noticed that gay Michigan with hard lockout has way less new cases than freedom loving Ohio whose cases are flat.  Which is the opposite from the start of the epidemic.  The gay Iranians are also experiencing a true second wave per google statistics map.

I also dreamed last night of my wife‚Äôs wealthy good friend‚Äôs husband (who my wife is probably fucking when she says she‚Äôs taking the kids to their pool for the day while i work) and his comments near the previous bottom when he said ‚Äúi‚Äôm down a million, A MILLION DOLLARS, what do I do?‚Äù. Sheepishly I said that I also converted gay too late and i lost a few orders of magnitude less than that on late FD calls

When I awoke I remembered my post Brr gay FOMO which I then gave into by buying cruise ships and IWM value stocks which were rewarding but now i‚Äôm torn because I don‚Äôt know what the Fed will say or do, and if they Brrr more then have to have equities to capture asset inflation, but also Trump finally looks as done as my wife‚Äôs cooze after satisfying her friends husband, so will the market be happy when Sleepy Lyin Joe wins and the democrats roll over the Repubs?

I tried to trade premarket but unlike webull, Fidelity encourages restful sleep until 7am, and also since only a handful of meme stocks trade liquidly, i‚Äôve done well premarket like 20% of the time anyway, especially since stocks only go up, then when i buy at work before noon they go down but recover by 4pm"
