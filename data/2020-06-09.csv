2020-06-10 11:35:03,heartstesler,3,"Today at 2PM Jpow says  economy is recovering faster than expected and added 2.5M jobs in May 2020. There is no longer liquidity support is needed as economy is on recovery path and stock market has fully recovered even crossed ATH  of  Feb 2020 when US had best economy in the history of the world.

Fed job was to provide support in the interim from pandemic shock to path of recovery. 

Economic data‚Äôs are showing clear sign of recovery and additionally 2.5 M jobs were created further support strength of the recovery is robust. Further says that  no more liquidity support and QE needed as US economy is recovering faster than expected. 

And further says keeping interest rate low for now and will review if inflation target is achieved of 2% and will continue to monitor yield curve and data.


Then what will happen

Is above not true?

Will he not speak truth?

Why Jpow will not say when economy is showing faster recovery than expected as claimed by Trump and stock market showing this?

There is huge liquidity in the system even Trump administration is saying no more stimulus is needed.

What is going happen then after 2 pm

Treasury yield is already going up a per Wells Fargo 

Treasury yield comeback is real, and the 10-year could hit 1.5% within months, Wells Fargo says

Also noticed that gay Michigan with hard lockout has way less new cases than freedom loving Ohio whose cases are flat.  Which is the opposite from the start of the epidemic.  The gay Iranians are also experiencing a true second wave per google statistics map.

I also dreamed last night of my wife‚Äôs wealthy good friend‚Äôs husband (who my wife is probably fucking when she says she‚Äôs taking the kids to their pool for the day while i work) and his comments near the previous bottom when he said ‚Äúi‚Äôm down a million, A MILLION DOLLARS, what do I do?‚Äù. Sheepishly I said that I also converted gay too late and i lost a few orders of magnitude less than that on late FD calls

When I awoke I remembered my post Brr gay FOMO which I then gave into by buying cruise ships and IWM value stocks which were rewarding but now i‚Äôm torn because I don‚Äôt know what the Fed will say or do, and if they Brrr more then have to have equities to capture asset inflation, but also Trump finally looks as done as my wife‚Äôs cooze after satisfying her friends husband, so will the market be happy when Sleepy Lyin Joe wins and the democrats roll over the Repubs?

I tried to trade premarket but unlike webull, Fidelity encourages restful sleep until 7am, and also since only a handful of meme stocks trade liquidly, i‚Äôve done well premarket like 20% of the time anyway, especially since stocks only go up, then when i buy at work before noon they go down but recover by 4pm"

I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there"

>If a second outbreak occurs triggering a return to lockdowns, world economic output is forecast to plummet 7.6% this year, before climbing back 2.8% in 2021. At its peak, unemployment in the OECD economies would be more than double the rate prior to the outbreaks, with little recovery in jobs next year.  
>  
>If a second wave of infections is avoided, global economic activity is expected to fall by 6% in 2020 and OECD unemployment to climb to 9.2% from 5.4% in 2019.  
>  
>The economic impact of strict and relatively lengthy lockdowns in Europe will be particularly harsh. Euro area GDP is expected to plunge by 11¬Ω% this year if a second wave breaks out, and by over 9% even if a second hit is avoided,¬†while GDP in the United States will take a hit of 8.5% and 7.3% respectively, and Japan 7.3% and 6%. Emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa, meanwhile, face particular challenges of strained health systems, adding to the difficulties caused by a collapse in commodity prices, and their economies plunging by 9.1%, 10%, and 8.2% respectively in case of a double hit scenario, and 7.4%, 8% and 7.5% in case of a single hit. China‚Äôs and India‚Äôs GDPs will be relatively less affected, with a decrease of 3.7% and 7.3% respectively in case of a double hit and 2.6% and 3.7% in case of a single hit."

That was 230 percent of what it made the week before and **700 percent of what it loaned the week before that.** This would suggest that the liquidity crisis is heating up and/or that it‚Äôs taking ever larger amounts to levitate the stock market as sellers come back in.

On Friday, UK will announce its balance of trade, industrial production, manufacturing production and GDP all in the same day. Later in the day, Euro area will announce industrial production rate. Then US will announce import and export prices. All are expected not to beat estimates.

During weekend & Monday, I am expecting a surge in COVID cases both in EU & US. Reproduction number is above 1 for most and due to protests & not social distancing.

On Monday, Euro area will announce its balance of trade. China will announce unemployment rate, retail sales, house price index, industrial production and business confidence. All are again expected not to beat estimates."

2020-06-10 07:40:12,Raekwonda,-18,"The complaint tablet to Ea-nasir is a clay tablet from ancient Babylon written c. 1750 BC. It is a complaint to a merchant named Ea-Nasir from a customer named Nanni. Written in cuneiform, it is considered to be the oldest known written complaint. It is currently kept in the British Museum.[1][2]
Ea-Nasir travelled to the Persian Gulf to buy copper and return to sell it in Mesopotamia. On one particular occasion, he had agreed to sell copper ingots to Nanni. Nanni sent his servant with the money to complete the transaction.[3] The copper was sub-standard and not accepted. In response, Nanni created the cuneiform letter for delivery to Ea-nasir. Inscribed on it is a complaint to Ea-nasir about a copper delivery of the incorrect grade, and issues with another delivery.[4] He also complained that his servant (who handled the transaction) had been treated rudely. He stated that, at the time of writing, he had not accepted the copper but had paid the money.

Tell Ea-nasir: Nanni sends the following message:

When you came, you said to me as follows : ""I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots."" You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: ""If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!""

What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and ≈†umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Shamash.

How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt."

I started at the 2 SD range and then moved it to the 3 SD range, looking at STONKS that have mooned or tanked recently to see if there was any trade possible.

If something tanked 3 SD below the mean, then they would most likely pop.. if something mooned 3 SD above the mean, they would likely drill

[AMZN at 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/Vr34VPV.gif)

Even with the current moves, AMZN seems to be well within its range

[FEYE 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/k1fNG0t.gif)

Looks like it crossed the 3 SD in 2013 and has tanked ever since. 

[MGM 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/CxpjztX.gif)

Hit the lower end of the 3 SD this year in march and then skyrocketed to the $20s

[TSLA 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/eGxjRA3.gif)

WTF TSLA! Hits 3 SD in Feb, tanks 50% and is now at 3 SD again. Short at your peril, long at your peril

[W 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/dUT7hEH.gif)

I was surprised this is still within range.. I would have thought it would have made greater moved going to $23 and then mooning. But nope! Nothing to see here

[WYNN 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/zoyAzii.gif)

This really REALLy surprised me. Wynn hit 3 SD in 2013 and then slow rode all the way down 2 years later .. then popped to the 2 SD and dropped like a hard rock once more. 

[LULU 2 SD](https://i.imgur.com/2j5KS0x.gif)
This was one of the first to catch my eye, then I went through all the other tickers I've been looking at to see if anything stood out .. fuck becky. After watching the 2 SD movement, that is when I switched to 3 SD and found this

[LULU 3 SD](https://i.imgur.com/KpcrSqb.gif)
If history serves, LULU should tank 50-60% of their current high sometime in the next 2-3 years. However, because 2020 is running on SPEEDFORCE! I went in on 12/18 $145p

Will it hit? Probably not, but they were cheap and way the fuck out there. Maybe LULU drops to the $200 range by years end, either way, these will be worth more than the $1.80 I dropped on them

Based on this shitty TA and a lot of glue sniffing, I don't see further upside to LULU

So this might be a perfect opportunity for JPow (or even Trump) to allow markets to fall a little to calm that rising unrest. A 10-15% dump from here won't do harm to big bois.

Health checks and quarantines will become the norm. It will no longer be so easy to take quick weekend trips to Bangkok or Hong Kong on a budget flight. Industries that depend on travel, like aviation, hotels and tourism, will take a long time to get back on their feet, and may never recover fully.

Countries will also strive to become less dependent on others. Especially for essential goods and services, like food or critical medical supplies. This will have strategic implications. Countries will have less stake in each other‚Äôs well being. They will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one.""

2020-06-10 04:59:27,LpTrizzax1982,7,"I see the advantage of having a central bank buy bonds from the government versus the government literally printing money in that theoretically it allows for a mechanism for that created money to be pulled back and destroyed at some later date (when the bonds mature and the central bank gets that cash back). 

The treasury could also just create batches of money with some maturation date attached at which point they are obligated to destroy the same amount of $ created (or a bit less if they want some inflation).

My questions is why doesn't the FED buy bonds directly from the treasury at 0% interest rather than go through primary dealers at market rates? The government would save money on the interest payments and we in turn wouldn't have to pay that interest in taxes. Or am I mistaken and the Treasury pays a real nominal interest rate of 0% since the FED kicks back 100% of their interest received on bonds back to the Treasury anyways (I don't think they do though?). 

The only way this makes sense to me is if the thing about income tax going to the FED is a myth and we are simply taxed as an inflation reduction mechanism and secondarily to fund some small expenses"

2020-06-10 04:31:33,,78,"It's funny how when an investment fund has 30 million dollars and buys and drives the price up, it's a completely normal and textbook consequence of demand.

When 100,000 people each drop $300 in Robinhood and buys and drives the price up it's ""a bubble"".

I'm not saying people aren't goofy and dumb like buying Hertz and knowing how bankruptcy works. That's a consequence of the accessibility of the tech now.

I'm saying the fact that you're winning is hurting egos and feelings. Maybe some of these secret tea leaf readers lose a bit of shine if you realize it's really as simple as invest in companies you like.

Fuck dude I bought 10 share of iRobot because I like Roomba. Is it ""MaNiPuLaTiOn""??? Is this the iRobot bubble? No, it turns out capital is just taxed less than labor and is inflation resistant. Put it on a smartphone and now it's not magic, and that makes old white men cranky.

Don't let em take those winnings from you. When you hit a lick, you take half and you drop it in high div yield ETFs and you never touch it again. If you run out of options money it doesn't matter you got that egg.

UK looking to reduce reliance on Chinese goods - report

The United Kingdom government is drawing up plans to reduce the country's reliance on critical goods imported from China, as the results of ""Project Defend"" have shown the UK needs to diversify its supply chains.

According to a report published by the Financial Times on Wednesday, the project is being overseen by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and has a goal of strengthening the country's trade links in the post-pandemic world.

Meanwhile, tensions between the two countries continue to grow as Hong Kong's new security law remains a big issue for the Western powers."

The Fed isn't going to do anything tomorrow or anytime soon that'll cause a dump because if they do Donnie will just call them out and then they'll have millions of conspiracy gun toting nuts calling them deep state operatives trying to hurt Trump and nobody with a brain wants to deal with that shit.  There is no way this is crashing until the elections because this is key for this administration to stay in power.  Sure there are millions unemployed but right now those people are getting the extra $600 a week in unemployment so they aren't going to be defaulting on shit.  The Fed solved the immediate liquidity problem so this boat is going to stay afloat.  Just stay cash if you're scared but use a little to buy the dips on boomer shit and make some profit.  Trying to time the crash is going to leave you gay fucks broke.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Black Ice air fresheners in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the air fresheners and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and called me a üåàüêª. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by asking if they had any Nikola trucks in stock."

Also at open I got:

25 $8c TWO 7/17

25 $10c NRZ 7/17

25 $60c XOM 7/17

Was hoping for everything to run up like the past couple trading days but immediately started seeing red on my account. So in the spirit of a true autist, I bought every dip on TWO.

At the end of the trading day I had:

65 $8c TWO 7/17 (Down 17.76% ‚âà -$1235.00)

25 $10c NRZ 7/17 (Up 5.0% ‚âà +$5.00)

25 $60c XOM 7/17 (Up 14.47% ‚âà +$275.00)

Really hoping for POW to work his magic and make me some tendies tomorrow! Feeling pretty optimistic about my TWO position after seeing that it was the only REIT in the positive and while most of the other REITs got absolutely destroyed."

I had a friend named Charles

Every morning, Charles had a routine

He would take off his shirt then climb on the biggest tallest table in the room. It was the first thing he did every morning

Then, he would just start jumping and screaming, at the top of his lungs, which signaled the rest of us to follow

What a rush, and don't get me started on the pageantry!

As Charles jumped and screamed, the rest us ran to our cot and became ghosts, grabbing pillow covers and ribbon wizard wands to put a spell on Charles, making him scream and jump louder

We loved it, Charles loved it

Especially when we slapped him with the ribbon wands. They were silk, and he loved how they felt on his skin

He would jump, then we would slap, chanting

""Charlie brown, get down!""

That one phrase, over and over, it was a blast. Best yet, the more excited Charles got, the louder and higher he jumped

And then we were all told to stop, immediately, no warning at all; and everyone -- including Charles -- threw a fit. The daycare even called his mom

Come to find...

One social warrior parent saw us and thought what we were doing was racist

Racist. Five year olds. Why?

Because he was black? Simp."

We saw MGM had a very nice run. We had a very nice bull flag at the 18 level that we ran last week on news up until the 21.8 level, after that we've began moving our strikes and expiration dates, PT for 25 for EOW was in sight until last night, the GAP that occured is what we want to fill to push us back in the right direction.

Key levels are visible in the graph and below as follows:
Key support- 21.3
Support needed for leg up- 22.3 (we closed just above on AH which I hope to maintain if futures permit)
Key resistance to break for next step- 22.67 (after this- 23.3)
Gap fill- 23.5 to 23.99 (Expect a bounce here to shake people off, this is where we close our short term contracts)
Bounce expected around 23.8 then break of 24. 

PT for EOW = 24 
PT EOM = 28.2 (resistance around 28.6 will not chance it except with a few runners)

All the big boys are cashing out via these bagholders. In a couple weeks once they're done they, the big boys like Icahn, Grundlach, Ackman will short everything, which will cause normal money managers will sell so they don't perform worse than the market etc.  


Retails will get fucking raped like no tomorrow. The steepness of the March decline shows you how leveraged these degenerate gamblers are, a small move down and they get liquidated.  


All this talk about V/U/L/square root/swooshed shaped recoveries is just hopium to allow the big boys to get out. The economy is not recovering for at least a decade.

2020-06-10 01:43:31,ThetaMeBitch,-5,"Free advice time:

Let's start with a quiz. 

Question: What is one of the responsibilities of The Fed?

Answer: Employment!

Good job!

Now, here is the weird part. Remember that crazy report that came out last week? You remember,  the one that blew estimates out of the water. The one Trump was tweeting about immediately and held a press conference for? What was that report about?

Answer: Employment. 

Employment magically obliterated estimates. Think about that in the context of The Fed.

Free advice time: think carefully about how you're positioned in the market."

And further says keeping interest rate low for next two years.

Don't believe me? Don't blame you, especially with all the chicken littles screaming about the sky falling. 

All I suggest is to be prepared to rapidly exit longs, don't get emotional if we start seeing reversal like movements. **Get a fucking hedge. Just buy at least 1 long volatility option with 45DTE+**. If I'm wrong, I'll do whatever you like. Mark it. 

Not even trying to sway anyone here. I'm a bear converted to bull. I'm still bullish. But the charts are just telling an obvious story here. We're going to see some scary shit in the market in the next few weeks. 

Get your cash while you can, get ready for a down turn, 10x your bull gains on the way down, don't get caught in the trap of buying puts when we're bottomed out, and don't be a retard and go all in over night on a volatile play in the following weeks.

The stock, for example, closed at $73.27 yesterday -- more than 100% higher than where it closed Friday -- after its founder revealed that the company will soon accept reservations for its electric pickup truck. Citron Research, however, isn't impressed.

In a tweet, Citron Research, run by short-seller Andrew Left, today revealed its skepticism about the stock's recent rise, stating that it sees shares of Nikola falling to $40 in the next few weeks.

Instead of blowing your wad on days we gap up save cash for red days so you actually have capital to make bigger buys. 

Those options you have that lost 50% of their value today mean you could have bought twice as many contracts with the same cash. 

Red days should be an onslaught of purchases. Instead it‚Äôs autists bitching about how much they‚Äôve lost, bitching about how they‚Äôre too afraid to buy.

Now we have people piling into mREITs not realizing that most had to sell the majority of their assets at the bottom in forced liquidations at fire sale prices, so it's literally impossible for them to get anywhere close to where they were trading before the crash because they are literally half the company or sometimes less than they were before the crash.

 At best, if we get a V shape recovery, IVR is a $5 stock and TWO is $7 or so.  Like Uncle Warren, they sold at the bottom and even if things go back to normal, it'll be with much smaller asset base that generates substantially lower yield, the bulk of which get absorbed by their cumulative preferred shares.  No one really wants a low yield mREIT, except people here I guess."

Instead, the Fed will likely reiterate that the economic uncertainties support the need to continue dumping money into the market.  


Additionally, it's likely the Fed doesn't want to do anything that may be construed as politically motivated with the elections drawing nearer.

2020-06-09 21:15:14,WinterWeather5,-4,"(WSJ) -  

The market value of Nikola Corp., a little-known electric-truck startup that went public last week, has surged past that of Ford Motor Co. and other car companies in recent days, as investors continue to bet on the growth potential of electric transportation.

Shares of Nikola, which is developing commercial and passenger vehicles using batteries and hydrogen fuel cell technology, have more than doubled since they began trading publicly on Thursday.

The startup's market capitalization eclipsed $30 billion in intraday trading Tuesday, higher than Ford's value of about $28.8 billion and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV of about $20.5 billion.

Phoenix-based Nikola, which hasn't yet sold any vehicles, has targeted the commercial trucking sector, where companies like Amazon.com Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. have pledged to reduce the carbon footprint of their logistics operations. The company has also signaled it intends to nose into the pickup market for individual consumers, the most profitable segment of the U.S. car market.

The firm's surging stock price underscores investors' preference for electric-vehicle upstarts over traditional auto makers. Shares of Tesla Inc. and China's NIO Inc. have more than doubled this year, while shares of General Motors Co. and Ford have been hammered amid factory shutdowns from the pandemic. It also illustrates that Wall Street's enthusiasm for electric cars and other future technologies remains strong, even as businesses more broadly face new pressures stemming from the recent economic fallout.

Nikola has said it has over $10 billion in preorders from commercial clients including brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and expects to begin generating revenue next year with deliveries of a battery-powered semi truck for shorter-haul deliveries.

Nikola's stock began trading on June 4, a day after it completed a merger with VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., a publicly traded acquisition company run by former General Motors Co. executive Steve Girsky. The deal left the new entity with an implied value of about $3.3 billion. Shares finished trading last week around $35, a market capitalization of about $13 billion.

The stock rallied Monday, after Nikola executive chairman Trevor Milton tweeted Sunday night that the company would begin taking reservations for a consumer-oriented pickup truck called the Badger on June 29.

The Badger, which the company has said will be powered by both an electric battery and hydrogen fuel-cell technology, wasn't seen as a priority for the company and was unlikely to be built without a strategic partnership with an established manufacturer, the company said in corporate filings in May.

But Mr. Milton changed his tune Sunday, saying the company would reveal a fully operational prototype soon at a company event in the next few months. On Tuesday, he set an ambitious goal that the Badger would overtake the country's highest-selling model.

""My goal is to take the throne from the Ford F-150,"" Mr. Milton said in a live interview with Yahoo Finance. The F-150 pickup has been the top-selling model in the U.S. for many years.

Ford declined to comment.

Tesla Inc. shares also have been on a tear, having more than doubled this year to close Monday at $949.92. The company's market capitalization of $176 billion as of Monday's close is nearly double that of General Motors Co., Ford and Fiat Chrysler combined.

Traditional auto makers have struggled to attract the same attention from investors, despite big spending in battery-powered technology.

GM, Ford and other big car companies, along with upstart firms, are developing electric pickup trucks and delivery vans, betting that commercial customers eventually will be drawn to the lower operating cost of plug-in vehicles.

Many also are developing electric pickups and SUVs for individual buyers, betting they will be drawn to an upstart brand in the vein of Tesla, the only auto maker that has found broad success selling electric vehicles.

Tesla Inc. has said it is taking orders for its futuristic-looking Cybertruck, which could go on sale by late 2021. Ford and GM also have electric-pickup plans in the works.

Privately held Rivian Automotive has a contract with Amazon.com Inc. to make 100,000 electric delivery vans over the next decade. The Michigan-based company, which has drawn investment from Amazon, Ford and others, also plans to bring a Rivian-brand pickup and SUV to market next year.

Executives from traditional car makers say they remain committed to the development of battery powered cars even amid the cash crunch from the pandemic, which closed factories for months this spring. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said the auto maker won't curtail planned investments in battery-powered cars.

Many car companies have dabbled in hydrogen-based electric cars, which use onboard fuel cells to produce electricity from hydrogen and oxygen. But the high cost of the technology and lack of refueling stations have limited their appeal, while many car companies have pegged their future electric-vehicle plans to lithium-ion batteries.

Nikola will build its first semi trucks with IVECO, a heavy-duty truck brand owned by CNH International NV. CNH also owns 7.1% of Nikola's outstanding equity after an investment round last year that also saw automotive supplier Robert Bosch GmbH invest more than $100 million.

piece of article that came out in barrons today. 'The S&P 500 Has Erased Its 2020 Losses. The Fed's Money FLood Suggests Room to Run'. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to do more, assuring investors that the central bank has more firepower and is willing to use it. To that point, the Fed on Monday said it would expand its Main Street lending program by lowering the minimum loan amount, raising the maximum loan limit, extending loan terms, and allowing businesses to defer principal payments for two years instead of one.

On the surface, [the rally over the past two weeks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-economy-is-bad-but-stocks-are-rallying-heres-one-reason-why-51590659100?mod=article_inline) appears to have been driven by an earlier-than-expected and smoother-than-feared gradual reopening of the economy and signs of consumer resilience, says Shalett. Aside from the surprise rise in payrolls, personal income grew 10.5% in April and the savings rate jumped to 33%. That‚Äôs as initial jobless claims, while still high, have continued their weekly decline, manufacturing surveys beat expectations, May auto sales improved, and mortgage applications increased for the seventh straight week.

Deeper down, Shalett says, Fed-driven liquidity is booming in a way that can help sustain asset prices. ‚ÄúAll told, this strong data validates the market narrative of a V-shaped recovery,‚Äù Shalett says. "" by Lisa Beilfuss"

> In latest market rally, even companies filing for bankruptcy get love

> Still, it‚Äôs a mystery why money is flowing into these businesses, as their bonds are trading at beaten-down prices that imply there will be little left for equity holders after the bankruptcy process is complete and the company is reorganized, said Lale Topcuoglu, senior fund manager at J.O.

I had a friend named Charles

Every morning, Charles had a routine

He would take off his shirt then climb on the biggest tallest table in the room. It was the first thing he did every morning

Then, he would just start jumping and screaming, at the top of his lungs, which signaled the rest of us to follow

What a rush, and don't get me started on the pageantry!

As Charles jumped and screamed, the rest us ran to our cot and became ghosts, grabbing pillow covers and ribbon wizard wands to put a spell on Charles, making him scream and jump louder

We loved it, Charles loved it

Especially when we slapped him with the ribbon wands. They were silk, and he loved how they felt on his skin

He would jump, then we would slap, chanting

""Charlie brown, get down!""

That one phrase, over and over, it was a blast. Best yet, the more excited Charles got, the louder and higher he jumped

And then we were all told to stop, immediately, no warning at all; and everyone -- including Charles -- threw a fit. The daycare even called his mom

Come to find...

One social warrior parent saw us and thought what we were doing was racist

Racist. Five year olds. Why?

Because he was black? Simp."

What's interesting is international growth ramping to 270% YoY growth, 500 customers added in Q1 alone (read: April) that will contribute $100K+ a year. Incremental revenue above guidance was $130MM in Q1, which means with most of it being booked in April due to COVID, provides $400MM of revenue upside to Q2 without any new incremental business added in Q2. Current guidance is $500 and they will at least hit $600MM, if not closer to $750M if they book the same amount of new business in Q2 as they did in the last 4-6 weeks of Q1."
