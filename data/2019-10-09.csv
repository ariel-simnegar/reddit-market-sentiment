No matter what either party says one side will not fully cave into the others demands, this is a renegotiation of trade terms and global influence between the two major economic and military powers in the world. The back and forth will of course continue. If you're betting on the markets falling because of no trade deal than that's a risky play, cause there is no such thing as no trade deal between two economic powers who currently still depend on each others markets. What makes more sense is markets falling because of a global contraction which is amplified by the trade disputes."
