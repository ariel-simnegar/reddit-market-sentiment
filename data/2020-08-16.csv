2020-08-17 10:35:05,Throwawayeconboi,2,"Everyone remember:


AAPL won’t sell off at open. It’ll start to go vertical for a bit, and you’re gonna think it’s gonna stop. And then it won’t stop. And you’ll buy in. And then it will stop. And it’ll go flat/down-ish the rest of the day. And you’ll curse it and never buy AAPL again. And then it’ll do the same thing the next day.


I’ve been watching it. It never sells off right away. But the drop will come even if it doesn’t look like it (not like a dump, just a gradual ease off into the end of the day). Be patient, it’s gonna look unstoppable. Trust me, it’s not. 


If it helps stop the urge, wake up an hour after open."

The KODK insider trading case is going to be very challenging for the SEC to prove.  Even if they do manage to prosecute 1-2 individuals, there is still a chance the deal could move forward.  The deal makes this company worth $20+ per share.  

So what's the play here?  In my opinion, you want to buy spreads way out.  I'm looking at January 15, 2021.  That's about 5 months from today.  So here's what I'm buying today:

* BUY: Jan $10C @ $2.92
* SELL: Jan $22.5C @ $1.10

Net cost is $1.82 here.  Potential upside is $10.68.  KODK breakeven price is $11.82."

Anyway, I'm at this ""event"" now and in all honesty, I'd rather be at work. I hate how I'm like this, but I just don't care about jackshit outside of work and making money anymore. Most people in my family cannot wrap their head around why I wanna work away my life, but what's the point of explaining this shit when I kind of don't understand it myself. Hope everyone's night is going well."

2020-08-17 03:23:38,CptTonyStark,28,"Holy fuck I figured it out. I don't hate my life and I'm not sick and tired of it, I just hate myself. If I can just devote myself to a goal that makes me forget all about myself, just keep focusing on tasks so intensely that I lose myself in them, I might not have to commit sudoku to get out of this awful life situation. Honestly, I used to love myself once upon a time even though I was objectively worse back then. But constant rejection from companies and girls made me lose my ability to love and accept myself. 

Now, my life is great in most ways but I still don't love myself. I don't see myself loving and accepting myself anytime soon, I'm very honest and self-critical, so the only option is to lose myself in some challenging task that requires all my attention.

Thank you so much autists."

2020-08-17 01:39:36,DustyBowls,5,"What you learn from history is the market goes down. It goes down a lot. The math is simple.  The markets had 50 declines of 10% or more in 93 years. About once every 2 years the market drops 10%. We call that a correction. It's a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. That's all you need to know. The market goes down sometimes. And if you can't handle that you shouldn't own stocks. And its good when it happens. If you like a stock and it goes from 34 to 14 that's good for you. If the balance sheet is great and you like the company then you're buying at a steal.

People are in an unbelievable rush to buy a stock. I'll give you an example. Walmart went public in in October of 1970. Already had a great record, 15 years performance great balance sheet. You could have waited 10 years after IPO and made 35x your money. If you bought when they went public you could have made 500x your money."

China’s Banking Watchdog Warns Fed Easing Risks Financial Crisis
Bloomberg News
August 15, 2020, 10:22 PM MST
Chairman Guo also cites rising bad debts at Chinese banks
Guo’s warning is the second in recent days on Covid-19 risks
The Federal Reserve’s unparalleled stimulus risks plunging the world into financial crisis, according to the chairman of China’s banking watchdog, who also warned that bad debts at Chinese financial institutions could balloon significantly this year due to the impact of Covid-19.

“In an international monetary system dominated by the U.S. dollar, the unprecedented, unlimited quantitative easing policy of the U.S. actually consumes the creditworthiness of the dollar and erodes the foundation of global financial stability, said China Banking Regulatory Commission Chairman Guo Shuqing.


“The world may once again be pushed to the verge of a global financial crisis,” he wrote in an article published in the Communist Party’s Qiushi magazine on Sunday.


For China’s financial sector, “after the Black Swan of the virus pandemic, asset quality will inevitably deteriorate,” Guo said.

The article comes on the heels of a similar warning from Guo in an interview with Xinhua, where he cautioned that easy access to funding could spark a reemergence of financial irregularities, and that China should make preparations to deal with a rise in non-performing assets.”"

The democrats will not budge from their stimulus demands so they can say that republicans aren't doing enough to help people.  they are also not going to let trump have an opportunity give people 1,200 dollar checks week before an election.  Stimulus will have to wait until after the election, probably until next year.

1 of the biggest benefits is in the retirement accounts. Anyone who has one/knows about retirement knows that $5500 is the max contribution. Throwing 1/3 into of your contribution goes against everything a retirement plan is. With over 60% of americans having stocks in their retirement, this opens up a massive new demographic of accounts that will be able to purchase Tesla now. I, for one, will add 2 shares to my retirement account after the split.

You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically."

Some Indian dude on Youtube taught me how to disconnect the front camera cable and that would solve my 4013 error and let me update and back her shit up.

COVID is actually a positive catalyst if you think about it, the elderly and boomers are actually a massive suck on the economy and because they hold most positions of power, they are the gatekeepers keeping us poor.  

The payroll tax cut actually supports my thesis. Time to embrace the fact that the government wants boomers off the books, you should too!
