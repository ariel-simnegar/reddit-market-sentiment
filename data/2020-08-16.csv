2020-08-17 10:35:05,Throwawayeconboi,2,"Everyone remember:


AAPL won’t sell off at open. It’ll start to go vertical for a bit, and you’re gonna think it’s gonna stop. And then it won’t stop. And you’ll buy in. And then it will stop. And it’ll go flat/down-ish the rest of the day. And you’ll curse it and never buy AAPL again. And then it’ll do the same thing the next day.


I’ve been watching it. It never sells off right away. But the drop will come even if it doesn’t look like it (not like a dump, just a gradual ease off into the end of the day). Be patient, it’s gonna look unstoppable. Trust me, it’s not. 


If it helps stop the urge, wake up an hour after open."
