Oddly, it's trading at \~500% premium over net asset value (stonk at $131 versus $22 NAV). Graysclae has a couple other US-traded issues ($GBTC and $ETCG, that track bitcoin and eterum classic, respectively). They trade at NAV premiums too, but nowhere near the nosebleed valuation that the thinly traded, heavily manipulated $ETHE does. I've been following ETHE for awhile, and the question for discussion is, **how can this thing continue to be worth 6X cash?** I mean, the trust literally holds nothing but Ethereum; exactly 0.09404 ethereum ($239 \* 0.09404 = $22.57) for every share of $ETHE ($131).

 * At the moment of this comment, SPY is above 305

 * 7/17 SPY 300c is currently about 13, and 7/17 SPY 305c is about 9.75, for a difference of 3.25.

 * A textbook example of bull spread would say you're in for (305 - 300) = 500 in gross profit if the 305 gets called on you and you use the 300 to fulfill the request.

so why isn't their price at least 5 dollars apart?"

Jobs will come back for the vast majority of people temporarily laid off, only because they were laid off due to businesses being under quarantine. Now that businesses are opening up, the vast majority of people will be back to work. BULLISH.

The COVID bear market was the fastest bear market in history, even faster than the Great Depression. And it wasn‚Äôt even economic factors that made us crash. It was fear and panic.

That‚Äôs why we will have the fastest recovery in history and we‚Äôre not technically even in a bear market anymore. 

Riots have made people forget about COVID. A lot of restaurants have begun raising the wages of their employees and including tipping in the actual price of food. So no more stupid tipping and both front and back actually get paid $15 an hour.

I can understand VTIQ as the merger with Nikola will likely increase the stock price but I can't help but think it's a meme stock until these trucks actually exist beyond just a theory. 

Lets say Nikola succeeds, CNHI will benefit as they'll be asked to produce more trucks. 

Lets say Nikola fails, CNHI still stands to benefit as Nikola is investing 40 million to upgrade their factories, and they're already on the hook to make 12,000 trucks by 2024. 

Sounds like Nikola wont be focusing on sports cars till 2024, so competing with TSLA in the short term isn't really in the conversation. 

CNHI's spread is trash and I don't usually pay attention to options with wide spreads and low volume but I feel like leaps are a potential play.

The amount of people holding out on this ""recovery"" for a pullback to ""get back in"" and not believing it will last, just tells me we have a ways up to go up anyways. This market can remain irrational longer than anyone will expect, so SPY to 420 and I am calling new vastly higher ATHs imho.

The pullback so it isn't going to happen because everyone is waiting for it. On top of that the system is rigged to the upside so if something bad happens they will just rewrite the rule book for another recovery and fomo rally. Might as well get in before the real fomo hits...

And none of this market ""price action"" (can we call it that even?) Has any connection with reality and if you are trying to think your way in navigating this all, you are an idiot... Don't fight the FED and a system that will save the financial markets at any costs to society.

2020-06-01 12:54:39,IndianTechSupport,10,"There have been 2 major historical stock market moves since Fall 2019. First SPX melted up to 3400 from Oct 2019 to Feb 2020 then crashed from Feb 2020 to late March 2020. Combination of these two moves formed a blow off top that initiated a cyclical bear market in March 2020.

In bear markets, majority stays bearish for obvious reasons, and most of them get decimated or wiped out while picking tops during massive bear market rallies. Once they are reduced to little to nothing, bear market resumes.

The trick is, every monster bear market rally, that can last as much as months, will make you believe that the bear market is over."

1. Some like it long, some like it short.

2. You can study the market as much as you like, but it all comes down to luck.

3. Those who talk about it the most, have the least experience.

4. One simple mistake could lead to 18 unprofitable years.

5. Some prefer to sit back and watch it grow.

6. Terms include swing trading, asset turnover, naked call, after hours, insider trading, silent partner, blind entries, 30-day wash rule, straddle,
triangles, descending tops, ascending bottoms, pump and dump, partial surrender, stop order, position limit, voluntary liquidation, and explicit
interest.

7. Low confidence can keep you out of the market.

8. Everyone tends to focus on performance.

9. Some do it alone, others do it with a group, and some hire professionals, and the best reason ...

10. Some positions are better than others and the best position is always up for debate!

And remember, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results."

 It's like betting a store isnt gonna open again after a hurricane. Yeah, they're gonna have some problems obviously but the hurricane will go away and everything will go back to ""normal"".

Hi guys, would like to get your thoughts on this upcoming SPAC, $FMCI. Recent SEC filing Forum Merger II Corporation (Nasdaq: FMCI) (‚ÄúForum‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) today announced it has signed a letter of intent and expects to sign a definitive agreement to acquire a high-growth, plant-based food company with a broad portfolio of innovative products that are aligned with major food trends and sold through leading retailers and distributors across the United States (the ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù). Current market cap $236.24m, best comparison with $BYND market cap $7.59b.   
 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390020012047/ea121786-defa14a\_forummergii.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390020012047/ea121786-defa14a_forummergii.htm)   
 

To look at the history of Forum Merger Corporation, we look at the former Forum Merger Corporation I. The former merger was complete with ConvergeOne, a leading global IT service provider on Feb 23, 2018. [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/convergeone-and-forum-merger-corporation-complete-business-combination-300603264.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/convergeone-and-forum-merger-corporation-complete-business-combination-300603264.html) ConvergeOne was than bought over by Clearlake Capital LP for $1.8 Billion in November 2018 [https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/06/why-convergeone-stock-skyrocketed-today.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/06/why-convergeone-stock-skyrocketed-today.aspx)

Other recent SPAC companies are like VTIQ and DKNG. Let me know your thoughts. Possible rumours of it being Impossible Foods? - [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/stock-admin-at-impossible-foods-1850853576/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/stock-admin-at-impossible-foods-1850853576/)"

2020-06-01 03:27:21,IndianTechSupport,16,"There have been 2 major historical stock market moves since Fall 2019. First SPX melted up to 3400 from Oct 2019 to Feb 2020 then crashed from Feb 2020 to late March 2020. Combination of these two moves formed a blow off top that initiated a cyclical bear market in March 2020.

In bear markets, majority stays bearish for obvious reasons, and most of them get decimated or wiped out while picking tops during massive bear market rallies. Once they are reduced to little to nothing, bear market resumes.

The trick is, every monster bear market rally, that can last as much as months, will make you believe that the bear market is over."

This is gonna push already embattled retailers/companies that rely on physical assests over the edge and accelerate the insolvency crisis.

Additionally, IWM and other Russell Indexes are supposed to have a fund rebalancing end of June. Big funds that own the index will be forced to mass sell companies that are being kicked out. Might be a good time to go through every company in the index, select companies that fit the following criteria:

1.	Have a lot of debt,
2.	Are in retail/tourism/physical entertainment,
3.	Have huge amounts of unsold inventory rn,
4.	Just acquired a lot of physical assests recently

and short the shit outta them.

Also, online retail only makes up 4% of the total retail industry and this will be the perfect time for AMZN to increase that share manyfold. 

GLD calls, AMZN calls, IWM puts, and puts on any retailer with no online presence and lots of debt should print $$$"

Bears: You are 100% correct. The market SHOULD be burning right now. The market, however, is disconnected from reality and the actual economy. It's rigged. It sucks, and it's not really investing anymore, but the fed/governments have made it perfectly clear they will do ANYTHING to keep that boomer wealth alive. Me being a millennial, I am fucking pissed about this as well, but we can't fight this. Instead, make a shit load of $$$, and put it towards something you believe in. It will go down, but don't try to predict it every day/week.

&#x200B;

Bulls: Stop being assholes. Keep buying, but don't over leverage yourself. The market will go down, and the last thing you want is to be all in on calls when that happens. Long term, stocks go up. Idk wtf is going to happen this week, but I will be buying more calls. Doesn't mean it can't implode tomorrow."

My question is how do we bet on this new paradigm? Who sets the odds? Where can I make prop bets on what is going to burn and what isn't? I feel like we're on the horizon of a new dawn of competition where you don't bet on athletes, you bet on cities? You show respect for veterans of the sport like Los Angeles but also respect to rookies like Minneapolis. We need to set up a union for these athletes and negotiate TV rights for broadcasts. This is the wild west of a new gold rush, and that gold can be found in the piles of broken glass and tear gas canisters that are piling up in this beautiful country of ours.

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. 

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. 

You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

Wondering why the market looks so different than the news? Besides Powell going HAM, there‚Äôs also the actual corona numbers. The news is hysterically shrieking aimed at terrifying everyone into complying with social distancing rules. Almost exactly like HIV in the early 90s, but I digress..

Latest CDC estimated mortality rate for *everyone* under 50, including high risk patients and asymptomatic cases:

0.00325% (ie 0.005% x 65% of symptomatic cases)

NYC hospitalization data:

94% of *all* hospitalizations across age groups had one comorbidity. 88% had multiple. The % likely far higher for <50 cohort. even higher if we look at deaths vs. hospitalizations but too lazy to pull this data.

so ballpark % chance of a healthy person under age 50 dying of coronavirus: 0.00325%*6% =

<0.000195%. 

America has lost its fucking mind with this shit. We should‚Äôve just protected the elderly and unhealthy. I assume the market thinks our brains will start to work again eventually.
