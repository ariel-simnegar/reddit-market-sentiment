1) Wake up.

2) Stare at vertical red AMD chart until I think it has reached bottom and buy (most likely too early)

3) Stare at vertical red GLD chart until I think it has reached bottom and buy (most likely very early)

4) Check on TSLA debit spreads that autistically change value every 5 seconds from -$20 to +$700 to -$5000 etc., stare blankly and make no sense of it.

5) Go back to sleep.

6) Wake up right before close with either a guh to close the trading day or a yippee (I’m playing AMD so I’m banking on guh)

7) watch futures"

A lot of businesses are shutting down and a few big megachurches are holding protests and holding services but telling their members to not bring their phones and to only carry cash when they come into the city to come to church, so that they can't be contact traced back to the church. We will probably go back into level 3 lockdown in the next week or so. 

Huge red days (~15%) in the Korean market.

Puts on EWY for next month will absolutely print over the next few weeks."
