2020-08-20 05:57:30,chuck_portis,7,"[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1099933/travel-and-tourism-share-of-gdp/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1099933/travel-and-tourism-share-of-gdp/)

""The total contribution of the travel and tourism industry in 2019 accounted for 10.4 percent of the total GDP worldwide"" 

[https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us](https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us)

""The total size of commercial real estate in the U.S. was estimated $16 trillion in 2018.""

How long can the US government hide the complete destruction of multiple industries?  Just the two industries above are absolutely decimated by any real measure.  This doesn't even touch on restaurants, oil & gas, bars, unpaid mortgages, 10% unemployment, education, etc.

It's all a huge mess and the US is still right in the middle of it.  There is so much faith being put in this vaccine, but does it really succeed in rescuing these industries anytime soon?"

2020-08-20 01:47:58,sixthsense450,12,"Hey All, A real simple thesis that I'm going to begin echoing in this forum is how American Solar will outperform big time under a Joe Biden presidency.  Expect any mention of the green deal, or ""America First"", which insinuates solar industry protection tariffs, in the presidential debates to drive solar volatility to the upside.  If you look at solar stocks and think they've gotten ahead of themselves based on the charts....think again.  The 2009 and 2013 run ups under an Obama administration made people filthy rich.  My top pick based on valuation is  ReneSola LTD (Ticker SOL).  I don't think a P/S ratio north of 3 is that big of a stretch when you consider catalysts and where the S&P 500 trades.  That implies a price of $7-8 dollars a share while this stock trades under $2 currently.  This isn't a shit bucket penny stock but rather an established small cap company with tremendous growth prospects.  With that being said, if you have other solar stocks which are worth mentioning feel free!  Happy hunting people."

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

The end is near."

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Guys be careful, for real."

Fund managers are going to continue selling AMZN and WMT to add to current/new positions in TGT. The company has been killing it for the last three years and many investors were strong believers in the ‚ÄúAmazon effect,‚Äù i.e. Amazon will destroy all competition. 

After three years, it‚Äôs clear that Amazon will always have competition as they forced other companies to adapt and innovate or be killed. Target, being relatively smaller than Walmart, has far more upside. Big investors are going to FOMO after missing out on the gravy train for years.

Edit: AMZN drilling while TGT keeps going up. The downvotes make me sad."

**Context -**

The S&P 500 declined 0.4% on Wednesday, as investors took some profits after the benchmark index set a new all-time high and Apple (AAPL 462.83, +0.58, +0.1%) reached a $2 trillion market capitalization.

All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory as selling accelerated into the close. The real estate (-2.0%) and energy (-1.2%) sectors fared the worst. .

The S&P 500 was only up 0.3% at its high, and a hair below the 3400 level, before turning negative shortly after the FOMC Minutes were released at 2 p.m. ET.

Nothing new was stated in the minutes, but officials remained concerned about the economy and possibility of a protracted recovery.

The U.S. Dollar Index rebounded 0.8% to 92.99, while gold futures pulled back 2.1% to $1970.10/oz. WTI crude futures were flat at $42.90/bbl.

In retail earnings, Target (TGT 154.22, +17.32, +12.7%) and Lowe's (LOW 158.28, +0.37, +0.2%) reported strong earnings results, but Target's 12% gain set it apart. TJX Cos. (TJX 54.36, -3.09, -5.4%) fell 5% after reporting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.

Separately, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 150.39, +0.30, +0.2%) agreed to acquire Momenta Pharma (MNTA 52.12, +21.31, +69.2%) for about $6.5 billion in cash, or a 70% premium to yesterday's closing price.

Wednesday's economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which decreased 3.3% following a 6.8% increase in the prior week. Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for July, and the Philadelphia Fed Index for August on Thursday.

2020-08-19 21:47:41,troylus81,6,I'm not so sure about unemployment claims beating again. The exec order could've convinced people to sit on their asses again. And with schools reopening and going virtual. I think a lot of parents are going to be forced to stay home and collect because of their kids. Thats why Trump wants to reopen schools so badly. It was never about the kids. It was about the daycare being open for parents to go back to work.

In past weeks the narrative has been (other than stonks go up) to load up on gold/silver and to watch the DXY for signs of weakening dollar and therefore inflation. I added a splash of silver myself when it was \~$22/oz but the bullish case for metals is not looking great.

The Fed minutes caused banks, bond yields, and DXY index to rally. What changed? The Fed isn't interested in trying yield control, for one. They also are bearish for the near and medium term, and seem to be looking expectantly at Congress to carry the weight of the recession recovery at this point. They're also looking at ""results based"" rate decisions. Which means as soon as they see inflation go too far above 2%, BAM they will drop the fucking hammer with a rate increase.

I think we'll now see a bit of upwards pressure on bond yields, which will not be great for metals and will also siphon away some of the fat from tech."

The SPY üì∑ is officially üóΩ higher üëÜ than it was at the peak üöôüö£üèæüïù before üòÇ the fall üçÇ. 

The SPY üëÄ Growth üå±üëç‚Üï is almost üí∏ 10 üîü% higher üí¶üòç than at the peak üöôüö£üèæüïù before üòÇ the fall ‚¨á. 

The DOW ‚¨á is down ‚¨á only around üîÉ 6 üïï% from the all üíØ time üïê highs üïõ. 

The S&P ‚ò† 500 üë©üéì is now above üîù all üíØ time ‚è∞ highs ‚¨Üüòé. 

Even üåù the TSX is only down ‚¨á around üîÉ 7 üí™üòÇ% from all üë®üë¶üíØ time üïê highs ‚¨Ü and the oil üí¶ sector and other major üîë industries üè≠ of Canada üçÅ got üç∏ decimated.. 

We are seeing üëÄ Warren üí∞üò± Buffet üç±ü•òü•ô go üëâ into Gold üèÖ I üëÅ never üò°üôÖ thought üí≠ü§î I üëÅ would see üëÅ the day üåû (I üëÅ know ü§î people üë•üë´ are gonna üë¶üëâ do the standard üï¥üèª quip üòë but üçë Buffet üç±ü•òü•ô and Munger are beasts üêÇ). 

We are now seeing üëÄ the trade üí∏üí≥ volume üé•üéÉüôÜüèø hit üëä all üíØ time ‚è∞ lows ‚¨áüìâ on üîõ certain üòé key üóù areas ‚ö†üíÄ. 

We still üôÑ have massive üåê waves üåä from COVID üò∑üòª in areas ‚ö†üíÄ of employment üë§, debt üö´üôèüèΩüí∞, inflation/deflation, business üë©‚Äçüíº closure üåç, bankruptcy üè¶, massive üòÇ inequality üóΩ‚è± of savings/wealth. 

We have certain üîó segments blown üí• up ‚òù to the point üàØ that when üçë I üëÅ look üëÄ at the charts ‚ùóüö∫ I üë• don't ‚ùå even üåÉ think üí≠ ""bubble üí¶"" is an accurate ‚úÖ term üìÑ. The charts ‚ùóüö∫ literally üëã give üéÅ me cancer ‚ôã they are so intense üò± to look üëÄüö´ at. 

I üëÅ love üòç pa üë® pa üáµüá¶ elon üë®‚ÄçüöÄ just like üòÑ everyone üë• but üçë the fact ‚òë that this short üëïüëñ squeeze ü§ú‚úä has taken üíÖ us üë® to around üîÉ 1900 is insane üòµ.

This may üóì all üíØ keep üëå going üèÉ on üîõ for more time ‚è∞ than I üëÅ could ever üò† imagine ü§îüòëüôÑ.

For god üòá sakes üç∂ away üòÇ from the memes üê∏ for a second ‚è±üòû and our fun üòÇüòÉ ass üçë phrases üò´üò© please üôè please üôè be careful ‚ö†‚ùå that you üëà aren't going üèÉ over üîÅ what you üëâüñï can handle üò≤ if this reverses üò£. 

We have already üëã seen üëÄ how some main üëø stocks üß¶ can go üèÉ down ‚¨á 60-80% once they start üí¢ falling üõ¨üçÇ in a month üìÜ and how the whole üí¶ indexes üìöüìî can fall üçÇ almost üí¶ 50 üí∞% in a month üìÜ and a half 1Ô∏è‚É£‚ûó2Ô∏è‚É£.

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Ahead Of Earnings  
Mentioned:  AMD  NVDA  
Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) traded flat on Wednesday, but the stock has been among the top performers in the market so far in 2020.

Nvidia investors have shrugged off the economic shutdown as the shelter-in-place environment has driven demand for high-end gaming graphics cards. Even with the stock up 108.7% year to date, one option trader made a big bet that there's more upside in the second half of 2020.

The Nvidia Trades: On Wednesday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received seven option alerts related to unusually large Nvidia option trades. Here are the largest:

At 10:51 a.m. ET, a trader bought 424 Nvidia call options with a $510 strike price expiring on Friday. The contracts were purchased near the ask price at $8.75 and represented a $371,000 bullish bet."
