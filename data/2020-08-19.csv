The squeeze is on and so many more paths lead to war than peace here that it’s not inevitable but almost worth betting on. EU won’t partake. China and Russia wont overtly step in.

2020-08-20 01:47:58,sixthsense450,12,"Hey All, A real simple thesis that I'm going to begin echoing in this forum is how American Solar will outperform big time under a Joe Biden presidency.  Expect any mention of the green deal, or ""America First"", which insinuates solar industry protection tariffs, in the presidential debates to drive solar volatility to the upside.  If you look at solar stocks and think they've gotten ahead of themselves based on the charts....think again.  The 2009 and 2013 run ups under an Obama administration made people filthy rich.  My top pick based on valuation is  ReneSola LTD (Ticker SOL).  I don't think a P/S ratio north of 3 is that big of a stretch when you consider catalysts and where the S&P 500 trades.  That implies a price of $7-8 dollars a share while this stock trades under $2 currently.  This isn't a shit bucket penny stock but rather an established small cap company with tremendous growth prospects.  With that being said, if you have other solar stocks which are worth mentioning feel free!  Happy hunting people."

2020-08-20 01:46:28,Revolant742,13,"~~2008~~ 2020.

Even before the opening bell, ~~Monday~~ Thursday looked ugly.
But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.

Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor — the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

“You just felt like the world was unraveling,” Ryan Larson, the firm’s senior equity trader, said. “People started to sell and they sold hard. It didn’t matter what you had — you sold.”
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

The end is near."

And yet, crickets

How do the reports get it so different (8+ million fucking barrels??), and why does the first receive so much more attention?

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Once the bulls are complacent, go bear mode and let it crash to the march lows again, and eliminate the bulls out of the market

Fund managers are going to continue selling AMZN and WMT to add to current/new positions in TGT. The company has been killing it for the last three years and many investors were strong believers in the “Amazon effect,” i.e. Amazon will destroy all competition. 

After three years, it’s clear that Amazon will always have competition as they forced other companies to adapt and innovate or be killed. Target, being relatively smaller than Walmart, has far more upside. Big investors are going to FOMO after missing out on the gravy train for years.

Edit: AMZN drilling while TGT keeps going up. The downvotes make me sad."

**Context -**

The S&P 500 declined 0.4% on Wednesday, as investors took some profits after the benchmark index set a new all-time high and Apple (AAPL 462.83, +0.58, +0.1%) reached a $2 trillion market capitalization.

All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory as selling accelerated into the close. The real estate (-2.0%) and energy (-1.2%) sectors fared the worst. .

The S&P 500 was only up 0.3% at its high, and a hair below the 3400 level, before turning negative shortly after the FOMC Minutes were released at 2 p.m. ET.

Nothing new was stated in the minutes, but officials remained concerned about the economy and possibility of a protracted recovery.

The U.S. Dollar Index rebounded 0.8% to 92.99, while gold futures pulled back 2.1% to $1970.10/oz. WTI crude futures were flat at $42.90/bbl.

In retail earnings, Target (TGT 154.22, +17.32, +12.7%) and Lowe's (LOW 158.28, +0.37, +0.2%) reported strong earnings results, but Target's 12% gain set it apart. TJX Cos. (TJX 54.36, -3.09, -5.4%) fell 5% after reporting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.

Separately, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 150.39, +0.30, +0.2%) agreed to acquire Momenta Pharma (MNTA 52.12, +21.31, +69.2%) for about $6.5 billion in cash, or a 70% premium to yesterday's closing price.

Wednesday's economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which decreased 3.3% following a 6.8% increase in the prior week. Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for July, and the Philadelphia Fed Index for August on Thursday.

In past weeks the narrative has been (other than stonks go up) to load up on gold/silver and to watch the DXY for signs of weakening dollar and therefore inflation. I added a splash of silver myself when it was \~$22/oz but the bullish case for metals is not looking great.

The Fed minutes caused banks, bond yields, and DXY index to rally. What changed? The Fed isn't interested in trying yield control, for one. They also are bearish for the near and medium term, and seem to be looking expectantly at Congress to carry the weight of the recession recovery at this point. They're also looking at ""results based"" rate decisions. Which means as soon as they see inflation go too far above 2%, BAM they will drop the fucking hammer with a rate increase.

I think we'll now see a bit of upwards pressure on bond yields, which will not be great for metals and will also siphon away some of the fat from tech."

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Guys be careful, for real."

Ahead Of Earnings  
Mentioned:  AMD  NVDA  
Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) traded flat on Wednesday, but the stock has been among the top performers in the market so far in 2020.

Nvidia investors have shrugged off the economic shutdown as the shelter-in-place environment has driven demand for high-end gaming graphics cards. Even with the stock up 108.7% year to date, one option trader made a big bet that there's more upside in the second half of 2020.

The Nvidia Trades: On Wednesday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received seven option alerts related to unusually large Nvidia option trades. Here are the largest:

At 10:51 a.m. ET, a trader bought 424 Nvidia call options with a $510 strike price expiring on Friday. The contracts were purchased near the ask price at $8.75 and represented a $371,000 bullish bet."

2020-08-19 20:10:03,acptest,3,"Thought...So if the market is at ATH's with all the stuff going on now, how high is it gonna go when we have a vaccine?"
2020-08-19 20:09:56,br0botic,211,"It turns out that downvoting bearish posts does not, in fact, prevent the market from going down."
2020-08-19 20:09:54,Orzorn,2,"Well, I said today I would be cheering for UPS and OSTK to go up. OSTK went up a lot, so I exited one of my put credit spreads and entered a call spread for 8/28 130/140.

But my cheering obviously didn't work for UPS because it acted like a bitch all day. Its got very low volume right now and just follows SPY's general direction. I'm dumbfounded that exdiv is Friday and yet there's been almost zero movement on this.

So tomorrow I will be cheering for UPS to go up."

2020-08-19 20:09:29,griswalt7,2,"$JPM got over a million shares traded at $98.55. Either that’s closing a short position or a big boy likes the price. Better be good because my put credit spread is riding on it and the short strike is too close to the going price.

$TNA, stay floating around that price range for the rest of the week. 

Overall, a good theta day."
