Ok I know people hate TA but still I think it helps and I want to help people.
So the pivot line for today was the resistance line yesterday @896.64 .TLSA  bouncing back down and the buyers lost.Now for today (only) it's between the pivot line and Support 1@824.30,The 20day SMA@822.49 acts like a magnet pulls it back to it.Now it might go back up to the pivot line then if it passes it R1 is at 959.41.
But if keeps dropping S2 is @761.53(whole lot pain)
And S3 back into the 600
@626.42
Good luck."

2020-02-05 10:05:59,long_AMZN,4,">  Tesla Rally Rings Alarm Bells, But Isn‚Äôt Cause for Panic  
>  
>By Mark Cudmore  
>  
>(Bloomberg) -- **Tesla‚Äôs mammoth stock** **rally** **reveals cracks in the functioning of markets, but isn‚Äôt a short-term negative.**  
Disclaimer: I have no experience in detailed analysis of a corporate balance sheet and claim zero ability to value an individual stock. This post isn‚Äôt a view on Tesla‚Äôs stock price as such, but on the broader implications of such as rapid revaluation of a high-profile name, in response to the QotD.  
Tesla has rallied 245% since October 23, 112% ytd and 36% in just the past two days. Such a shorts-squeeze in one of the most-scrutinized stocks in the world make a mockery of the efficient markets hypothesis. Even with earnings and deliveries improving and analysts upgrading the stock, it‚Äôs a stretch to assign a $40 billion two-day jump simply to better fundamentals.  
Rather, Tesla‚Äôs explosive gains underscore structural vulnerabilities brought on by the rise of passive investing and the divergence between market liquidity and cash liquidity. However, while the phenomenon is worth noting, it‚Äôs hardly a cause for panic.  
We‚Äôve been here before: Volkswagen soaring 348% in two sessions in October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, comes to mind. At that point, markets were under severe structural stress as major providers of liquidity went under.  
Coronoavirus fears and frothy valuations aside, we‚Äôre we‚Äôre not yet in a similar environment now. Tesla looks more like a minor blip -- but one that nonetheless warrants attention."

So, we already saw that China will pump their equities if necessary. If they continue, which they will in the eye of worsening conditions, the fed will respond by easing even more in an attempt to maintain parity. Obviously that money goes nowhere but to bonds, and by extension equities. This will lead to a fat rally that has yet to be seen as analysts become even more comfortable with expanding multiples.

2. MMs are making bank on the premiums by selling calls and puts
3. As soon as a call is bought MMs buy shares to cover upside ‚Äî driving up the share price
4. MMs are more than happy with collecting the premiums and giving up upside (free money for MMs)
5. MMs also sell puts, collect those premiums, let puts expire worthless
6. Vicious cycle continues

Now, you can deposit $100 and turn it into $10,000 in a month by making a few well timed trades. 

I wouldn‚Äôt condone or advocate for the average American to practice the kind of degenerate gambling that occurs with members of this sub, but, the public education system is doing the lower class a disservice by not teaching our youth about simple economics,  how easy it is to invest and make money in this country‚Äôs equity market, and about responsible money habits.

2020-02-05 01:32:49,Dicklightful,4,"ayyyy Serious question yall:

So I bought one TSLA $1160 2/7 call earlier today for $14.80 x 100 contracts, and what I usually do to try and protect myself from too much loss is put in a stop limit order with a limit price of -25% of the initial price (in this case $11.10) and a stop price of one cent above in an attempt to guarantee the order will go thru; and then set it to Never Expires as opposed to Good for Day. This is an attempt to ensure that if the trade goes bad, I only lose 25% of what I initially paid regardless of whether or not I‚Äôm even looking at my RH account at the moment. If the trade goes well, then I cancel that order and sell for wtv profit.

But today, during TSLA‚Äôs huge drop toward the end of the trading day the contract price plunged well below $11.10 and is now sitting at $8.68. The stop limit order never triggered, and I‚Äôm still holding (hopefully TSLA explodes again tomorrow).

Did it not trigger because the price was simply moving too fast? or did it trigger in the background and just didnt sell due to RH‚Äôs shitty fill system? Or am I missing something here? Am I using stop limit orders incorrectly?

I‚Äôve done this a few times and have had stop limit orders trigger successfully and save me from the pain of losing 100% of my initial investment so I just wanna know what happened here so I can prepare accordingly for future endeavors.

Thank you to those who read this and can shed any light on my retardation.

God speed and praise Daddy Elon.

EDIT: Just want to thank all you wonderful gaybos for your responses, I think have a much better understanding of what happened now. Good luck yall <3"

2020-02-05 01:31:03,KimJongUnsTrousers,5,"$SQM is an ancillary trade idea that I saw someone else post here a few months ago that I found interesting. It seems to be tracking the Tesla rally these last few days, so it looks like the markets are legitimately anticipating a sharp ramp up in EV production this year. The short of it is SQM supplies Tesla with lithium for the batteries (Tesla's largest supplier is some Chinese company that isn't publicly traded) and on its own, SQM is also the largest lithium producer in the world. As EV picks up and lithium prices go up, they should benefit regardless of whether they are supplying Tesla or a competitor. Biggest risk is the Chilean political situation right now since it's Chilean. Basically, it's a Tesla play with much much lower volatility. 

Thoughts?"

S&P500 makes 100% gain if true else if steady gainz 10% annually else 10-30% drop. Bonds 1-2% gains over the year. Derivatives... chance of hitting it big with a low initial capital 1000x,100x,10x or bust....... use the income from bonds to fuel the seed money for the derivative trading, if the bubble actually happens and you make the gains you sell outta bonds once it crashes buy the s&p500, and withdraw the gains from the option account and continue trading on the downside.

As I mentioned last night, [futures were telling us there should be a bounce today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eydxpn/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_04/fggu7hb/) However, I didn't expect a jump this big-- we gapped up so much that we [zoomed past the correction trend without challenging the crayon line at all](https://imgur.com/vTmzAUF) for today's market movement. This is a very bullish move, obviously, and suggests that the near-term correction is over.

[VIX is nearing the bottom of its recent trend again,](https://imgur.com/MeN9zeU) and because I've never had to draw crayons when both US and China are doing repo, I'm not sure how to interpret market movement. Based on previous history, Feb is not a good month for trading-- however, the way price action moved today, it's incredibly bullish. Almanac Trader posted recently about the [history of a down/down Friday Monday,](https://jeffhirsch.tumblr.com/post/190503775588/djia-down-fridaydown-monday-inflection-point-in) saying that if losses are recovered then generally the ""correction"" is complete. In my post when the drop first occurred, [I questioned if we would go below 320 with US repo in play.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuvf8/weekend_discussion_thread_january_31_february_2/fg4oacw/) With China repo now also in play, and just looking at crayons, in theory we should be back on a bullish path.

The most telling sign will be if we drop within this week back to the correction trendline (~323), whether we bounce back up. We may never drop back to there, but if you believe in this reversal, then if we do fall there that would be the time to buy the dip again. 

If you want to be conservative, watching for PMI tomorrow and unemployment on Friday will be telling. Both of those are projected to be good. If you're not conservative and want to find ways to spend your TSLA tendies, past history suggests when there's a recovery like this we're supposed to go past ATH. The crayons say the same thing: by the time we rechallenge resistance again, the trendline is almost 334, which would indeed be ATH.

Good luck to everyone and eat a tendie in honor of the Musk. He seems to have made many of you get your portfolio less red today."

On the other side of the trade, the hedge funds who had sold VW short quickly saw their collective losses exceed $30 billion.   Hedge fund managers were ‚Äúliterally in tears on the phone‚Äù as they described ‚Äúa nuclear bomb going off in our faces.‚Äù

As a mega cap company, the short sellers who had been involved in the VW trade included some of the best-known names in the hedge fund industry.  This included David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global, Paul Singer of Elliott Management, Glenn Krevlin of Glenhill Capital, Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management, among others.    SAC Capital‚Äôs Steve Cohen had said that his fund alone had lost $250 million in just one week on VW."

It's entirely possible there are a few machines bidding each other up now and the retail crowd is simply pouring gas on the fire and spiking the bids up even higher in a self-fulfilling loop. The industry has also been growing immensely so they certainly have the fire power to pull this off (see 2 Sigma, DE Shaw, Point 72, etc). This is why I think all these experts are saying they have no explanation for the price movement this week. Anyways, I'm in at that closing dip. I need to learn to be the FOMO and ride the wave with you gents."
