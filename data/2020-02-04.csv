Ok I know people hate TA but still I think it helps and I want to help people.
So the pivot line for today was the resistance line yesterday @896.64 .TLSA  bouncing back down and the buyers lost.Now for today (only) it's between the pivot line and Support 1@824.30,The 20day SMA@822.49 acts like a magnet pulls it back to it.Now it might go back up to the pivot line then if it passes it R1 is at 959.41.
But if keeps dropping S2 is @761.53(whole lot pain)
And S3 back into the 600
@626.42
Good luck."
