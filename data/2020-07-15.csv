2020-07-16 01:44:36,throwawaystemcel,-3,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

This is nothing but super bullish from a technical perspective.  Price hit 323, pulled back hard, hit 323ish resistance again, pulled back a bit less and then gapped up last night with futures.  Crazy bullish TA!

I would suspect that SPY ATH is the next real resistance but this market is absolutely fucked.  It could very well be here when you add in a new ""black swan"" everyday.  I think the cheap interest rates and surge of retail interest is driving a melt up.  Add leverage in the form of the popularity of options and you have volatility with some firepower behind the retail side.  

I'm generally wrong but this is just what I'm thinking despite a lot of bearish sentiment tonight."

They're late, because even our nights have been hot, and cool nights are vital for nightshade fruiting. But they're beautiful, healthy plants.

2020-07-16 00:00:29,18845683,5,"Fun fact I learned recently (probably old news to many): when VIX and SPY rise in concert you should be concerned about a selloff (at least in the current market). [VIX with /ES overlay](https://i.imgur.com/GegwqYi.png), comparing Monday's positive correlation (red outline) between VIX+SPY to that of June 5-10. As I understand it, what's happening then is big (smart? insider?) money is buying puts even as call values also increase, thus raising the overall premium value that VIX is measuring.


Edit: 

[Here I added some other spots I noticed on the 180d/4hr VIX chart to zoom in on](https://i.imgur.com/jBboL9l.png)

It seems like it's perhaps mostly an indicator of when you should be wary about holding calls during a market runup rather than a reliable indicator of a selloff, which can obviously be unpredictable.

She said PDT requires that I have 25k at all times and the 3 good faith violations restrict me from trading with unsettled funds. Furthermore, 3 good faith violations combine to make 1 free ride violation. 1 free ride violation restricts all other accounts to be traded with only settled funds...

Is she fucking wrong? Previously I was told that worse case scenario with PDT and 3 or more good faith violations within a year in a cash account only restricts me to trade with settled funds. In other words, day trade every other day. All previous reps have also did not say that 3 good faith violations = 1 free ride violation. Was this rep wrong or right because based on previous reps it seems like she was wrong about everything.

PDT in cash accounts doesn‚Äôt require 25k minimum but that only settled funds can be used. Which would reset after 90 days. 3 good faith violations does not equal 1 free ride violation and worse case scenario is that I trade with settled funds for 90 days. Correct?

‚ÄúIn a normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charges go up, home prices go down, none of that‚Äôs true here‚Äù as ‚Äúsavings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo, you will see the effect of this recession,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact 60% to 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working.‚Äù

The bank posted record revenue and better-than-expected profit in the second quarter, which was consumed by the pandemic.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a miracle the economy‚Äôs holding up this well, but miracles don‚Äôt cost $2.2 trillion. However, JP Morgan still had to take some gigantic loan loss charges because of what‚Äôs coming: the end of the stimulus.

1. More States are going to shut down. Black Swan events like California showed that's not ""priced in"". Texas might be next. That would be huge.

2. As forward thinking as the market might pretend to be, Q2 earnings will (mostly) be trash and Q3 - 4 won't have the ""revenge"" spending we hoped for due to Covid resurgence. Tickers like AMC, AAL, ect face real threats of bankruptcy.

3. Death totals ARE increasing, particularly in states that are surging. So Covid will continue to beat down ""recovery"" stocks that recently surged.

This week has showed why its tough to time when things will correct back down. I believe however this is a good spot to park some longer dated puts. August - January. Even as a hedge if your not üåà. Calls on VIX, ect. If you can't bring yourself to buy puts, calls on inverse ETFs. Even if we gap up, its hard to imagine going 1-3% higher than here sustainably.

Tired yet?

For those wondering, this week I played NET/TSLA early in the week (fucked up TSLA, check history), missed MRNA/AZN, and played [NCLH](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/1d49aa06-3f66-45a3-adf1-e62400fddd3a), [CCL](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/340a1e8e-a932-42e5-bd7a-99d9f537247b) off the scanner I use.

Next week, at EOD Friday, going hard to work from home stocks, MRNA puts. The kangaroo will now be on a trampoline. What is everyone else playing, beside bankruptcy?"
