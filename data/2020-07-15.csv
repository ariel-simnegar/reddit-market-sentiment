Imagine being an elite foreign investor and your worth is dropping by the day because fucking retarded inbred Southerner / Midwestern dipshits refuse to wear a mask and help stop the spread. Trump loves pumping the economy, but could getting spread down, just maybe, possibly help? 

Instead were going to go the fake the numbers approach"
