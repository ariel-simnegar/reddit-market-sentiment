No, this bull was feral, wild, out-of-control. As the sun crested to the west from its southern apex, I began to creep in, lasso in hand.  With the closing day, I sprang upon him, while he reeked of pheromones, high in the fury and ecstasy of his rut. Yet a drop of blood filled his eyes.  I wrangled with him through the night, and just before the opening morning, while exhausted and down, I plunged my Boone knife deep into his flank, then again and again.  Leaving little left of me.  The blood began to run.  Crimson colored in the morning light.  The blood flows deep, as he lies next to me. Taking his last breathes."

Who how’s how this entire thing will play out. If even one person slips through when we think we’ve handled it, it can start a pandemic all over again. The only real way our economy goes back to normal is with a vaccine that is proven and affordable.

Yes, traditional economic theory dictates that increased availability of fiat currency has a direct correlation to an increase in inflation. However, we have two robust examples in the last decade that contradict this. 

The first example is the 2008 recession, which between 2008-present, inflation has never been higher than 3.0%, even with interest rates being at historical lows. The second example is Japan, which has been engaging in QE for the better part of two decades. During that period, they have experienced more years with deflation than inflation. 

I personally don’t think inflation is going g to be as much of a problem as people are expecting. I’d be more concerned with deflation of currency at this point."

2020-03-25 10:37:07,koalasalt,12,"tl;dr: hard yolo

Like many others, half of my $40k RH portfolio is in puts right now:

* Down 50% from my peak a week ago (got greedy and fucked by the Fed). 
* Current positions are mostly SPY and V puts; sitting at -50% to -70% with May/June expiry. Will be holding them with guarded optimism; expecting a few big dips soon.
* The ill-advised APRN $3p 4/17 I got during the first pump is increasingly looking like a write-off, hoping to get out at -25%.
* If SPY hits 255 today I'm throwing the remaining $20k into 235p May/June to recoup momentum and because I'm a tired old man.

The equity portfolio is a bigger $50k gamble. Been riding the volatility the last two weeks to earn a decent amount ($20k). Currently I have a bunch of naked shorts (gasp) – mostly high risk positions in TSLA, SQ, AAPL, V, and JCP. I'm cost averaging them over this pump, fully expecting a good fall in the next week. Most of them are at +2% to -5% now and I'm targeting a 10-30% gain on each position.

My balls were forged in 2008/09 when I made +300%. Stay strong, bears."

More realistically, the mm and whales couldnt make money because it dropped too fast so they pump it up for sell off part 2. Im not even convinced u.e numbers will commence sell off. Time and the virus worsenining infection numbers will do that. 

Load up on puts. Its not goint to be as easy to make money on puts and you will see your portfolio bleed possibly, but the drop will come.

I fucking hate seeing people saying “Hur Dur, blah blah blah is priced in already.”, because surprise surprise, it fucking isn’t. None of this shit is priced in because internal deals and news is coming out every day. This is unprecedented. IV isn’t going to crush because NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS WHATS HAPPENING. Hold your calls and puts. If they are out more than even 2 weeks, you will find an opportunity to either sell for gains or sell for minimal loses. Stay calm. If everyone is panicking or spewing the same idea, don’t fucking follow. I guarantee you taking the advise of 400 people in this thread and panic selling and option is the wrong choice."

2020-03-25 06:57:50,manufacture_reborn,10,"So, if Trump really does tell everyone to go back to work in a week, then we will have lost 2 weeks to varying levels of lockdown and we'll be virtually guaranteed to hit 60% infected in U.S. this year before herd immunity. 

If 80% of that 60% (48% of total) take a week and a half off work, 20% of that 60% (12%) are hospitalized for 3 weeks, and 2.5% of 60% (1.5%) die.... then the productivity losses alone for the U.S. economy already justify current prices, and that doesn't even take into account that some sources are predicting unemployment to hit 15-20%, demand to fall off a cliff, and some businesses to fail entirely. 

Not even including the damage it will do to the rest of the world, I'm pretty damn confident that none of this is fucking priced in yet.

2020-03-25 06:06:26,the__porkchopexpress,2,"I'm hoping for 1 more day of followthrough. I was up about $35k today because I went heavy long late last week, a few days too early. My first target was 2350 on the S&P500 and we breached it on Thursday, so that's when I switched. I've been dipping my toes into oil and financials and went more heavy long on Thursday and Friday in both those because I think oil will gain when the price war ends. On Friday I also bought 10 April 245 calls and sold half today for 100% gains. I think this bounce will last a few more days. Right now, lots of bad news already priced in, I think there are a few points of good news that can help the markets:

1) Italy rate of death declines meaningfully because of lockdowns, which means that it works and its a template for a solution for the rest of the world. This will help financial analysts better model how badly the lockdowns will affect the economies, which is a big unknown right now. At least they can start putting real numbers down and advise their paymasters based on real numbers instead of guessing.

2) Stimulus package gets approved. $6T is pretty huge. Probably priced in but whatever

3) Some of these drug trials will be positive.

So I think there's opportunity for a short term bounce. I think over the lnext 6 months, markets will be less about coronavirus and more about the recession and make new lows and my target is 1700 on SP500."

There is around $0.5 trillion of outstanding consumer credit card debt. 

There is around $1.5 trillion of outstanding student loan debt.

Reality is whoever was struggling as a result of the virus probably went straight to their credit cards and will spend more than that measly check paying off the interest on that credit card with a 30% APR.

Which will go straight back to the pockets of bank execs.

Won’t even start with the student loan debt...

Anyone really think the execs taking the bailout dollars funded by tax payers will not pad their own pockets first? 

They’re using unemployment as leverage to take care of themselves and their buddies first.

And the average employee gets to keep their job. Yay! And of course they should be now happy to have a job. This just set the low bar of employees even lower."

> The United States could become the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as India announced a full 24-hour, nationwide lockdown in the world’s second-most populous country.

> Over the previous 24 hours, 85 percent of new cases were in Europe and the United States, and of those, 40 percent were in the United States.

>As of Monday, the virus had infected more than 42,000 people there, killing at least 559.

>Asked whether the United States could become the new epicenter, Harris said: “We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S. So it does have that potential.”"

2020-03-25 05:27:42,vendedor_de_tacos,7,"Reserve Requirements

For many years, reserve requirements played a central role in the implementation of monetary policy by creating a stable demand for reserves. In January 2019, the FOMC announced its intention to implement monetary policy in an ample reserves regime. Reserve requirements do not play a significant role in this operating framework.

In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period. This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses.

Will this undermine unemployment reports on 3/26?"

Either way, there’s gonna be a sell the news event since bi-partisanship will mean fresh fiscal policy will have to come in phases. Too many catalysts can bring another bear feast between the upward curve of new infections just starting, no clear timeline of when the economy will re-open (and it will happen slowly because governors), death count headlines, jobless claims. Personally, I’m looking at buying monthly puts if we push past 250 once news hits Congress has reached an agreement. After the final fiscal rumor pump, it’s all downhill and sideways until the infection curve flattens or parts of the economy re-opens and that’ll take time."

Feb 18 happened, I started browsing through WSB and I got addicted to it. I threw in my 500$ in some random puts and cashed out 800$ next day. Loved it, tendies blinded me, greed hugged me. I invested again the next day, more researched puts, cashed out at 1800$. Loved it.This continued, 3600$..5000$...10000$. Yesterday I invested my entire profit of 13k into april 3 spy 239p. I may lose some money tomorrow, but fuck, I haven't had this adrenaline pumped days in my entire life :)"

The volume is lower and spreads are wider, so you'll see quicker bursts in a single direction, but there isn't some dumb pension fund or any mom and pop investors trading futures. Even the click future traders are more knowledgeable than average traders, and the rest are all big hedge funds or prop trading companies hedging overnight risk and liquidity. I know a few big firms and banks run an overnight algo incase of breaking news or need to hedge."

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

A mighty woman with a torch, 

whose flame

Is the imprisoned lightning, and 

her name

Mother of Exiles.

From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she

With silent lips. ""Give me your 

tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"""

(c) Companies do stock buybacks with the extra money, like it's free candy.

(k) People see stocks only going up.

(y) Stocks only go up.

(o) Trump sees stocks going only up by TOO MUCH. ""Oh no! I'd better save some of this sweet syrupy sweetness for my November 2020! reee erection performance"" and starts artificially depressing the US economy using the old ""Tariffs on Chinese Goods"" trick

(u) Stocks waffle near SPY 293 for years and years

(r) Trump gets very distracted by his imp peach mint trial, and forgets to keep applying downward pressure on stocks with more tariffs

(m) Stocks accidentally go up to All Time High on February 19 2020.

2020-03-25 01:38:25,kkkodaxerooo,18,"While watching Jaws the other day, I was struck at the similarities of the level of denial exhibited by the the character of the film's Mayor of Amity Island, Larry Vaugn, portrayed by actor Murray Hamilton and the rational (and increasingly alarmed newly hired chief of police) Martin Brody, portrayed by Roy Scheider

Imagine the Mayor is Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases is chief Brody

In one of the first of several scenes portraying the ever increasing danger and impending doom, Brody finds the mangled body of the first victim on the beach

Brody wants to shut the beaches down immediately.

The Mayor, having just been told that the police chief was going to post warnings of a shark attack around the island locates Brody on a local ferry and tries to reason with the police chief that any warnings about a shark can seriously impact the economy of Amity Island.

To quote the Mayor's warning to chief Martin Brody as Brody attempts to warn the islanders about the deadly shark attack that just killed it's first victim...

""Martin, you say barracuda, the people say ""What??"", you say Shark and we have a panic on our hands on the 4th of July!""

If the police chief had his way, the beaches would all be shut down to prevent any further deaths but because of the town politics, he can only take small baby steps which, after each new attack, proving the failure of this piecemeal approach, only proves that his way was the correct one.

It isn't until the 4th attack in which Brody's son almost dies that Brody loses his patience with the mind boggling ignorance of the Mayor and takes over.

I only wish it was that easy.

Our president is a danger to all of us.

Dear Mr. president, Listen to Anthony Fauci.

Our Great White Shark, known as COVID-19 is now on a feeding frenzy in the US and you are actually considering serving the American people up as a veritable smorgasbord.

774 total people worldwide died from SARS with an estimated 9k infected. About 15% Mortality Rate.  
Ebola? 11k deaths during that 2013-2016 outbreak. 50% Death Rate!

CDC estimated that about 151,700k to 575k people died of H1N1 back in 2009. With an astronomical death rate of 0.02% of the world’s population.  


The biggest killer? Spanish Flu of 1918. 17–50 million people died. With a mortality rate of 1%-3%. It could've been a lot worse but thankfully Woodrow Wilson shut down the border to China very early on, and we also had the best doctors, and the most advanced medicine back then, o and 3m. 

In the U.S. alone, only 750 people have died from Coronavirus thus far. With a worldwide total of only 18,968 deaths. 1-4% Mortality rate. Good thing we flattened that curve early thanks to Donnie T shutting down the border to China!   


It's also no biggie , just a cold + more people die from the flu because ~~many people don’t or simply refuse to get vaccinated despite the widespread availability of free flu shots. Except in third world countries because fuck them that's why!~~  Donald says the flu is worse and we should get back to work."

2020-03-25 00:46:14,AntinatalistPoet,92,"I have a bottle of Japanese Whisky on my Desk. Single Malt. One bottle costs £500. 

My trading strategy is simple. I buy options equal to the value of that Whisky. Puts, calls, I don't care. I find a single option equal to the value of my single malt. I buy that option. What I do then is simple. I wait for the option to increase in value. When it is worth two bottles of Japanese Whisky, I sell it and call my Whisky Sommelier. He used to oversee the Yamakazi Distillery, the finest whisky distillery in Japan (and, in the view Mark Newton, chief critic of the World Whisky Awards, the finest in the world). He later became personal Sommelier to the Kumicho of Yamaguchi-gumi, the world's largest Yakuza family. He is also my personal Sommelier. 

When my Option doubles, I call him and masturbate while I place my order. If my option triples before I can pick up the phone, I give the excess to my Sommelier. 

If my option does not increase in value, I wait. If it hits zero, I drink the bottle of Single Malt on my desk, and enter my next trade. I don't bother pouring it into a glass, no need to savour it. I don't care much for the taste anyway.

I am not short of whisky. My cellar is being refurbished to make room for more Japanese Single Malt. My Sommelier has become the 56th wealthiest person in Japan, 32nd if you don't count women as people, which I don't."

There’s all other types of problems with the economy, but in my opinion, unemployment will be ok.

To keep saying “unemployment will be legendary,” yes, duh. But mortgages are being paused, car payments deferred etc. The economy didn’t collapse out of nowhere and it is a problem that can potentially be rectified quickly. If not, there will be impending doom, however right now people are optimistic.

Where the Fed gets unlimited money to print for stimulus, student loans, etc etc I don’t know, but as long as the price of toothpaste doesn’t double, the average Joe will not feel any effect of money being printed to infinite. We don’t live in a gold standard world, like it or not.

Uber never made money. They lost ~$0.18 a ride in the heyday of their IPO and depend on their massive pile of cash to operate at a loss. So if anything, total global meltdown means Uber will actually be losing less money than usual and their competitor Lyft may very well run out of money before they do. So if you were thinking Uber would beat Lyft in the next 10 years and become the ride share monopoly it's always wanted to be then now's a better time than ever to jump in.

2020-03-24 23:23:38,xesus2019,7,"While watching Jaws the other day, I was struck at the similarities of the level of denial exhibited by the the character of the film's Mayor of Amity Island, Larry Vaugn, portrayed by actor Murray Hamilton and the rational (and increasingly alarmed newly hired chief of police) Martin Brody, portrayed by Roy Scheider

Imagine the Mayor is Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases is chief Brody

In one of the first of several scenes portraying the ever increasing danger and impending doom, Brody finds the mangled body of the first victim on the beach

Brody wants to shut the beaches down immediately.

The Mayor, having just been told that the police chief was going to post warnings of a shark attack around the island locates Brody on a local ferry and tries to reason with the police chief that any warnings about a shark can seriously impact the economy of Amity Island.

To quote the Mayor's warning to chief Martin Brody as Brody attempts to warn the islanders about the deadly shark attack that just killed it's first victim...

""Martin, you say barracuda, the people say ""What??"", you say Shark and we have a panic on our hands on the 4th of July!""

If the police chief had his way, the beaches would all be shut down to prevent any further deaths but because of the town politics, he can only take small baby steps which, after each new attack, proving the failure of this piecemeal approach, only proves that his way was the correct one.

It isn't until the 4th attack in which Brody's son almost dies that Brody loses his patience with the mind boggling ignorance of the Mayor and takes over.

I only wish it was that easy.

Our president is a danger to all of us.

Dear Mr. president,  Listen to Anthony Fauci.

Our Great White Shark, known as COVID-19 is now on a feeding frenzy in the US and you are actually considering serving  the American people up as a veritable smorgasbord.

Is it valid to think that the US will not bear the brunt of printing 6T and throwing it away because we lend in our own currency.

Therefore, hyperinflation affects everyone and is less of an issue (basically this is one of the stipulations for MMT - is that you must borrow in your own currency)"

2) Any stimulus package is priced in (apart from a short-lived spike that we might get)

3) It's very possible that we see more than the 2.5M unemployment expectation this week. Over the coming weeks, it's very possible that we see this number rise to 10-15M.

2020-03-24 21:24:26,zg44,7,"You have to be adaptive while you're trading.  This was the first positive day that more than outweighed the previous down day.  That typically happens at a short-term turning point.  That means this short-term uptrend has some potential running room compared to any of the previous up days this past 2 months.

So it makes sense to play dips upward until this short-term trend runs its course.

I don't believe the bear market is done yet, but the massive amounts of Fed/Congress stimulus are starting to be a factor in pushing markets up.  There's also the fact that Italy's numbers are decelerating.

The key to everything is how coronavirus infections expand in the US.  Right now markets are hoping that Trump is right that people can start to go back to work/regular life by Easter.

While that's unlikely to be fully true, Trump is basically betting that there won't be another big wave of infections in May if people go back to work in early April.

If you're still looking at bearish plays, I'd wait until we see a lot more upward movement play out (S&P above 2700) or massive outbreaks in other US states (outside of NY/Cali).

The massive amounts of Fed/Congress stimulus are going to make investors more aggressive in buying dips here."
