No, this bull was feral, wild, out-of-control. As the sun crested to the west from its southern apex, I began to creep in, lasso in hand.  With the closing day, I sprang upon him, while he reeked of pheromones, high in the fury and ecstasy of his rut. Yet a drop of blood filled his eyes.  I wrangled with him through the night, and just before the opening morning, while exhausted and down, I plunged my Boone knife deep into his flank, then again and again.  Leaving little left of me.  The blood began to run.  Crimson colored in the morning light.  The blood flows deep, as he lies next to me. Taking his last breathes."
