2020-01-30 05:50:00,knotswag,22,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

As I [mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evbl8h/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_29/ffvic62/), something in the crayons and market felt off. For most of the day I thought I was full of shit, but that close and today's earnings has convinced me that we're now in the beginnings of a correction.

I don't think this correction will be large, or at least not immediately, though it's important to watch as it has the potential to get bad quickly. [Let's take a look at the VIX first.](https://imgur.com/FazqmKn) As you can see from the crayons, we broke into an upper channel on Monday and we just touched the support today and had a reaction (green candle). When price movements starts to follow crayons, it becomes a candidate for TA (though you want to see additional confirmation). 

A reaction would mean that tomorrow VIX is likely to continue upwards. Whether we clear the resistance (gold line) is a different story. That resistance line has been very consistent (in place since Feb 2018) and with repo going on and China holding back the impact of Coronas on their market, I think it'll hit 21-22 max and then we'll get a breather. 

This means that if tomorrow drops, (and it looks like it might with futures) a strong support is still at 320ish. This also means that if we hit that support, that is an objective reverse play (i.e. buy short term calls) in anticipation of a reaction back up. However I would definitely release any calls before EOD Friday. If I'm accurate and we're actually in a correction, people's thinking of ""just buy and hold the dip"" no longer holds true. This also means if you bought the dip earlier this week at the 324-325ish range, please be cautious if they're short dated. 

Basically, what you're looking for tomorrow is to see whether 325 holds. If 325 goes, it will trace towards 320.2, give or take a little bit. There should be a reaction back up, or at least consolidation, if it gets within that price to give time to react. I'll be back tomorrow with Magical Crayons TA to see what it looks like from there.

For bears, 317.5 is the next support level. If the crayons are right, we're going to hit that point sometime in the next two weeks. With repo going on, I'm not sure how much we'll fall below that-- I'll update if I see something change.

Good luck out there tomorrow and protect your tendies."

2020-01-30 02:06:27,DGUWYWMFWYWN,4,"""At least three of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan on Wednesday have been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to Japan‚Äôs health ministry.

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

Two flights have repatriated over 400 Japanese citizens from Wuhan on Wednesday and Thursday mornings local time.""

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this, but it seems the numbers are severely under-reported. Most likely because the infected are asymptomatic or because there's just no way to test everyone."

Oh, almost forgot.  The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It‚Äôs located at the Wuhan University of Technology.  Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äùwhich is both spreading rapidly and killing people.
