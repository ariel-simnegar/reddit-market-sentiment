> The economic havoc wreaked by Covid-19 has had a peculiar effect on the number of Chinese companies defaulting on their debt. There’s fewer of them.

> As of mid-April, China’s bond market has recorded 19% fewer defaults than it did in the same period of last year. That's because preserving jobs has become the priority as the coronavirus continues to suppress commerce around the world, leaving little appetite to continue the deleveraging policies that contributed to two consecutive years of record defaults.
