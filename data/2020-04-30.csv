> The economic havoc wreaked by Covid-19 has had a peculiar effect on the number of Chinese companies defaulting on their debt. There’s fewer of them.

> As of mid-April, China’s bond market has recorded 19% fewer defaults than it did in the same period of last year. That's because preserving jobs has become the priority as the coronavirus continues to suppress commerce around the world, leaving little appetite to continue the deleveraging policies that contributed to two consecutive years of record defaults.

""Well, see ya,"" I say and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Elon? He touches his neck as he watches me leave.  
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a joint.  
""Gonna pass that?"" he asks.  
""What's in it for me?"" I say as I pass him my hand rolled kush. He smiles.  
""Conversation with me, duh.""  
I laugh.  
""What's so funny?"" He protests.

""You get used to it,"" he says, taking a long, pensive hit before passing it back.  
""What would you do if you weren't a futurist entrepreneur?"" I ask.  
""Teaching, I think.""  
""And if I was your student, what would I be learning?""  
""Discipline,"" he says quickly, looking into my eyes, before changing the subject. ""Where are you from?""  
""Mexico"" I say.  
""Oh wow. That's lovely.""  
""It's OK,"" I admit. ""Not everything is to my liking.""  
""What could possibly be not to your liking in Mexico?"" he inquires.  
""I don't like sand,"" I tell him. ""It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."""

I think TSLA is fucked now that idiot tweeting elon is back, plus the “fudged numbers” inquiries.   If market has a bounce on Monday and TSLA moves back to $750 or so....getting July $650 puts, espies with Q2 numbers bound to be worse than Q1.   

Next, now that the big companies reported earnings....Whats left to prop up the market?  The only game in town is the fed and trump as the wildcard right?   And during the usual shit tome of the year for the markets, May to September.   

So:  TSLA $650p July
SPY $270p September

And for next week, ATVI $70c"

2020-05-01 18:36:42,serg-dawg,3,"I’m not normally one to post DD but I feel like I need to help out my fellow 🌈🐻. I work next door to a Hertz (HTZ) rental car company. Although I don’t work in a huge city, Hertz always seemed to get people to rent their cars. The auto body shop next to them would feed them customers constantly. The last few week (for some unknown reason) their lots have been full and I RARELY see people in their building. When I say their losts are full I mean they have to park multiple cars in parking lots next door or on the street. I also got work from the employees that there were a few locations not far from them that closed down so they sent employees to the one I work near. There is no doubt that all travel related industries took a big hit and earnings defiantly reflect that, but seeing how much the poor Hertz next door was hit made me confident enough to hop on the put 🚂. Coincidentally, there has also been some big positions opened up recently on unusual options tracker sites which also doesn’t favor their earnings on 5/12. Please keep in mind I’m just an autistic 🌈🐻 and I don’t know what I’m saying so do what you want :)

TLDR: puts on HTZ bc their earnings on 5/12 will be garbage.

Positions: HTZ $1 puts 5/15"

2. Gyna: Something about china and the bat-flu and starting maybe Wuhan.

 Shareholders may find more information at [https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/gossamer-bio-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=6290&from=1](https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/gossamer-bio-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=6290&from=1)  

Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)  Investors Affected : April 18, 2019 - April 6, 2020  

A class action has commenced on behalf of certain shareholders in Zoom Video Communications, Inc. The filed complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Zoom had inadequate data privacy and security measures; (ii) contrary to Zoom's assertions, the Company's video communications service was not end-to-end encrypted; (iii) as a result of all the foregoing, users of Zoom's communications services were at an increased risk of having their personal information accessed by unauthorized parties, including Facebook; (iv) usage of the Company's video communications services was foreseeably likely to decline when the foregoing facts came to light; and (v) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times."

2020-05-01 18:01:56,TheTigersAreNotReal,6,"Here’s an options strat for broke boys and people that like 5x returns in a short amount of time. 

Whenever there’s large movement in a stock price, whether up or down doesn’t really matter, buy far OTM puts or calls immediately. As the news of this stock movement spreads around, more volume will be driven to that stock, and the options as well. Within an hour or two your option price will have at least doubled, and if you’re lucky, gone up 5x or even 10x. 

I’ve tested this with GILD when it rose and when it crashed. I tested it with MESO when it shot up. Bought 5x 5p contracts for $15 each and sold them for $50 an hour later. And I just did the same today for TSLA. I bought a 300p 5/8 for $48 and sold it at $130 an hour later. I waited too long, but I could’ve bought the 420p for $83, which was then trading for $450 an hour later. 

This works because algos will pump the price up with increased demand, regardless if the stock will actually reach the strike price. Super easy way to double your money. This is the only thing I can say has guaranteed profits."

My wife and I bought our first home, a townhouse with most of what we were looking for in a location perfectly between our jobs so we both have 15 minute commutes.

Life pretty easy and care free.

Fast forward 4 years and we're now both home, trying to work full time remotely, taking care of 3 year old and 10 month old boys, the 10 month old is now fucking walking in this week somehow.

Their daycare probably isn't opening any time soon since NY officially closed all schools and the daycare was following the school schedule.

Were both drinking more in the evening. I'm watching thousands of dollars swing wildly in all directions each day.

Donald Trump is the president

Perhaps 4 years in the past me should have suggested we do more traveling and we maybe could have butterfly effected this shit into something different.

Normally this isn't a problem and it is a normal occurrence but with the recent bullish rally you would expect prices to break out of the expected move.  What is also telling is that many of them rallied after the earnings came out but were strongly sold into.  Sometimes big funds need liquidity like earnings to get out of large positions without effecting the price too much.  One thing is for sure today.  There is very strong selling pressure in the market but they are not chasing the bid.  It's a lot more dangerous to see markets simply slowly grind down with small pullbacks being sold into then see temporary spikes in breaks of liquidity."

2) the turnover of the board is extremely high and they are uninsured so all of the newbies are likely personally liable for his tweets as well

They are worth 11k now and I'm kicking myself for missing out on more gains. Bought and then quickly sold TSLA puts for next week since I'm just disoriented with adrenaline. I'm going need the weekend and probably longer to get my head back on straight."

A man called Elon Musk,

Was destined to bring light to Humanity's dusk,

Loved by some and hated by a few,

His already big ego grew,

'Go to space shall we,

And Ill take some of humanity with me,

I'll start a space company called Space X,

And maybe film some Martian sex, 

Let me start a online payment company,

And we'll shall see,

Let me buy TSLA, 

and Ill find a way to stop the syndrome of Kessler,

With my space tech.

I'll troll the SEC, 

With my tweets,

Let Grimes beat my meat,

'Funding secured at $420',

The hate was plenty,

Removed as Chairman of the Board,

But I'm not gonna stop and ill bring more discord,

Today I'll tell people that Tesla stock price is too high,

Make the stock price basically die,

Investigated again most likely,

But who gives a fuck, not me'"

Today the stock price is 10-15 cents below what it was when I bought them but the contracts are down like 18%. Theta isn’t a real factor because it’s so low with the far out exp. I feel like I got IV crushed but my question is how do I verify. In other words how do I check IV at the time I bought them so I can compare it to now? I use Robin Hood but am open to any tool.

The menstrual cycle does not sync with the lunar cycle, according to our analysis of over 7.5 million cycles.    

The lunar and menstrual cycles will correlate more or less for some people—depending how closely their average cycle length matches the lunar cycle, and the variability of their cycle length.    

The lunar cycle and the average menstrual cycle are basically equal in length.    

The terms “menstruation” and “menses” come from Latin and Greek words meaning month (mensis) and moon (mene)."

It doesn't matter if the other 495 are trending in the same direction, if one of those 5 moves in the other direction you're gonna get your ass handed to you.  


Bought 0DTE Puts @ SPY $285.2. Stopped out @ SPY $286 which we only visited thanks to AAPL's $15 rally (which should never have happened because it shouldn't have fucking dropped after hours in the first place. That after hours spike to 300 was a dead giveaway that it was gonna get bought up today and I didn't pay attention)."

Don't have enough lined up right now for a full DD post but:

* Almost all of the P&C insurance industry in Canada operates at an underwriting loss (by combined ratio) and relies on investment income on written premium for profit.. except for Intact, who've somehow figured out how to write insurance at a profit. i.e. If things get bad investments-wise they'll still be profitable, whereas the rest of the industry will have to start eating away at capital reserves to pay out claims.
* There is tons of room for consolidation in the industry:
   * Something like 90% of the Canadian life insurance industry is between 3 companies, Sunlife, Manulife, Canada life. Whereas the largest P&C insurer in Canada (Intact) is only 15%. If things get bad expect Intact to start acquiring smaller companies.

TLDR: Options volume sucks because TSX but for longterm long positions get some IFC."

&#x200B;

* So just like following any other big-name earnings report were getting analysts responding positively this morning
* You can see the sentiment <he sent me a screenshot of various analysts reports> was largely positive (or maybe you just consider this sell-side catching up, ha!)
* Besides the sell-side sentiment, not really seeing much
* And just to be clear, these notes (the analyst notes) were out much earlier in the morning right?  so, again, nothing breaking over the last hour or so
* something I will highlight though
* <shows me the after hours chart>
* did we really know why the stock sold off like that right after the report?  the report seemed strong, the conference call was optimistic.  so, I wonder if the upside now is just a reversal of that downside last night?

3. they posted \*record\* profits during this shitfunnel of a mess; with every lockdown continuing to some extent except for the USA (where lockdowns will happen again the USA healthcare system isn't fucking Sweden's lmao you're dumb if you use that as an example). what will they do when the market is regular?
4. incredible resilence and pivot from azure to cloud to teams. VSCode is the defacto coding tool for the web now, they have a shit ton of pull. AWS services are a bitch to manage, Azure is actually not that bad.
5. no ad revenue at all, no advertising. teams isn't just shitty zoom it's slack but without security concerns. that's just one product.
6. trade ban on china? no problem -- they aren't affected
7. only big tech stock on robinhood with 0% sell

I've always felt like this rally would last until it ***felt like*** the market should go up (economy re-opening, drugs, etc.). Now I'm getting that feeling that the ""good things"" have started, but we realize it's not going to be so easy. So just sitting on cash for a bit.

Not confident enough in a rug pull to buy any puts. But I anticipate a pullback. Can't have two consecutive record breaking months IMO."

2020-05-01 13:29:12,gallivanti,5,"$KMX, $HLF, $ROST shorts at 80, 38 and 98 respectively. 

All of these have ran up significantly off the lows. All of these businesses will be significantly hurt in this environment. 

For CARMAX, sales are down 92% in china in March, and down 45% in April. I presume the situation will remain difficult there as long as this virus continues to linger. The same applies to the U.S for the car sales industry. Look at $KMX performance during 07-09 timeframe to get a good indication of how this will perform in the next recession. 

For $HLF, Herbalife, 15% of their sales come from China. That business was down 15% in Q4 before the pandemic even hit the mainstream media. Imagine what the sales will look like in Q1. In that alone it’s a good short. But then consider their business in NA, Southeast Asia, Mexico, Venezuela, the list goes on. Every country has been impacted. You can’t have sales meetings and nutrition clubs. You really think these individual ponzu scheme distributors are going to be able to sell product during zoom calls and webex when people have post their jobs? 

Lastly, $rost. You can read my long diatribe I posted on these guys a few days ago. Ross stores has no online presence, they have no revenue streams unless they can open stores. And when they open stores, you aren’t going to have people flocking to them in large masses, this business is toast for the foreseeable future unless they can begin thinking about e-commerce."

2020-05-01 13:13:29,theknowndude,9,"This will be the start of a stustainable Boeing rally, as long as the market doesn‘t tank like in march.

Boeing just secured 25bn cash by selling bonds. Because of this they won‘t need federal aid and can keep their equity. This way they can continue buyback programs and pay out dividend in the future. The reason for Boeings bad performance during the market runup was because of fear of disastrous earnings numbers and a potential bailout by the state with negative consequences such as buyback restrictions and losing equity. Now that these two risks factors are both eliminated, it is time for Boeing to catch up. Regardless of market movements i see them recover easily to $160-180 next week.

At market level: government bond buying can solve liquidity by buying bonds and propping up prices with no bids. At company level: they can NOT solve solvency when growing debts exceed ability to pay them. Of the roughly $5T of asset purchases in the past few weeks, the Fed did \~50% of it. Before COVID, 1 in 6 US companies couldn't meet interest payments on debt binge they took on. Now  \~50% of all companies may not make May rent payments with plummeting revenues.

Now with declining revenues and record number of these loans mixed together in CDOs, the risk of cascade of debt defaults and bankruptcies seems very high.

Bulls say priced in. Me, I don't think so.

Know when to be cash gang and pull out, only make safe plays. Try not to ride the waves up if you're already going up, the top's always nearer than you think. Only ride the waves upward if you're at a historic bottom or a previous bottom, then, with a given amount of time, you should be fine if you date things out far enough or if you buy shares.

They way things are panning out looks like people ease back to work/extracurriculars slowly - I would imagine people won’t be rushing back to spin classes etc. Not saying this will replace gyms but I do see a market for products like these especially after this pandemic. Price for the bike is high but they’re also offering 0% financing and all bike holders will also be paying for a subscription. They’ll definitely have strong numbers towards the end of this and through the next quarter. Short float of 40% so potential squeeze with earnings due 5/6.

2020-05-01 02:24:33,hatemydarnjob,8,"hello homies.

for all the homies out there thinking how ""crazy hard"" it is to make money, it's not that hard y'all, its that we are crackheads and treat this shit like a casino.

Anyone with a small amount of $100 can get to 104k with just 10 perfect trades.

Math follows below

100 to 200 to 400 to 800 to 1600 to 3200 to 6400 to 12,800 to 25,600 to 51,200 to $102,400

This assumes you double the money every trade. You only need 10 good trades to get there but for some reason, our dumbasses trade 5-10 times a week in and out of positions instead of waiting for perfect set ups.

What is a perfect set up? you can define that yourself but i'd suggest ""earnings run up"" by getting into a position a week or so before the earnings day and have the general idea that the stock is going to do good on your side, and dump it all before the earnings. Amazon and Apple are perfect examples. (i did it with apple, up 96% from that position and sold before bell)

Other perfect set ups is when something is super super super obviously overbought like tesla and netflix.

You can do 1 trade every 2-3 weeks even once a month and still come out with 100k from 100 dollars from being patient.

im at 1800 from 95 bucks. 

My next trade will be ATVI because every clown on earth is saying ""ATVI GooNnnA crUsH Man, EvErrYonE's PlayiNg waRzoNe"" and dump my position before earnings.

Stop over trading y'all. if you hitting the PDT rule, you're trading too much. Wait for set ups.

&#x200B;

Good luck y'all!!!"

Tokyo consumer prices fall for first time in three years, revive deflation worries

TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Tokyo fell for the first time in three years in April, a sign that slumping energy costs and weak demand due to the coronavirus pandemic are heightening the risk of a return to deflation for the fragile economy.

The weakness in Tokyo prices, which are a leading indicator of nationwide inflation trends, underscores market expectations that Japan will see consumer prices fall in coming months as the economy feels a sharper hit from the pandemic."

The backstop isn’t going anywhere and even if the next quarter is abysmal we’ll be right here at these levels before Q2 is over so that it can push to ATH in late summer/early fall to make greedy boomers happy.

That’s literally the only thesis that matters to Trump.

Retired Boomers have houses and vacation homes, and boats and fancy cars.  People in their 20s and 30s are the most harmed in this environment so get on the winning team and know Trump can’t make this demographic unhappy.  Your debt is fucked bc you don’t get bailed out.

I’m mid 30s and my parents are ecstatic their portfolio is repaired after the recent damage.  They don’t care about anything else in their retirement and are exuberant that Trump and his team saved them.  They buy and hold forever bc Jesus Buffet told them to never sell.  They didn’t sell during the crash and won’t sell next crash.  

Buy September 320c every time you have the urge to buy puts and you can’t lose.  The pumps make you happy instead of miserable that it’s rigged. 

If we are headed down it’s going to be from another black swan event that will also be met with some kind of backstop or support that you can’t predict.  250? Sure.  Very briefly. But maybe it’s 270. Or 265.

It’s not 150 or 200.

Just AMZN and AAPL make up about 10% of the S&P 500 so if you remove those losses the rest of the index isn't really tanking in sync.

The AMZN news isn't actually all that negative, they're purposefully spending tons of extra money expanding to deal with the current environment because that's just how Jeff Bezos likes to run Amazon, he never gives a shit about the current quarterly profit. The fact that they can afford to throw $4 billion at this problem in Q2 is really more Bezos flexing Amazon's strength than anything else. The market took it negatively but if I was an Amazon shareholder I don't think this would be all that concerning."

So these motherfuckers that have been unemployed and tapped out their checking and savings accounts to be able to keep living are going to be broke as hell when payment time comes. 

Foreclosures are going to be coming down the pipe harder than a black mans shit after that Popeyes bender. We’re going to see housing crisis 2.0 and with big banks dropping the ball on these PPP loans for small businesses, it’s going to be coupled with tons of people declaring BKO at an alarming rate. Shit will hit bottom in August and then it’s going to be a fire sale.

2020-04-30 22:49:10,scopolamine,12,"Here's the DD since so many of you have asked: The greatest trick Fed ever pulled was convincing stupid traders that Fed would buy junk bonds.

Jay Powell seems to have ignited a new round of optimism among junk-bond buyers. The biggest U.S. high-yield bond ETF $HYG saw another half billion dollars flow into it yesterday, with flows also going to $JNK & even $EMB, which owns emerging-markets debt.

Fed Chair Powell did the opposite yesterday of pushing back against speculation that the central bank could buy more (and junkier) credit, or even buy stocks. Instead, he just said they could expand efforts & they're not out of ammo. Traders seem to be taking this as risk on.

It's helpful to remember that the Fed has yet to buy a single junk bond. This is all communication. The central bank has managed to put a floor under borrowing costs for many companies without putting a dollar to work. If it can continue to do this, it won't need to buy anything."

2020-04-30 21:17:27,makepeace12,2,"FYI Tesla dropped today because of a tweet by an infamous TSLA short seller that tried to say Elon cooked his books for the last ER report. 

Once Elon or someone from TSLA responds to the charge of fraud, and gives an answer to this guy, Tesla will resume trading around 830-850. 

If the dude is right, which I don’t think he is, then Tesla will have an accounting problem and will have to fix it. 

But big picture, even if there is a mistake on the ER, Tesla has enormous demand for their cars and the factory is opening back up soon. The worst is behind them, and with battery day coming up in mid-May, I’m pretty sure we are gonna see Tesla at 900 in a few weeks. 

How many times has Tesla proven short sellers wrong? Every single time.

TLDR: TSLA’s mid-day sell off was because of a dubious short sellers tweet about an accounting error on ER report. Tesla will respond tonight or tomorrow and show this guy was wrong. If Tesla opens down, which it won’t, load up on calls for mid to late May cause this is a dumb dip. Great buying opportunity.

Q1 quarter result is $92B revenue and $5 EPS while Q2 estimate at that time was $65B revenue.

Actual Q2 is $58B revenue and $2.55EPS.

Quarter to quarter, revenue is down 37%. Adjusted for seasonal fluctuations revenue is still hit 10% by the virus.

One single observation can invalidate a general statement derived from millennia of confirmatory sightings of millions of white swans. All you need is one single quite ugly black bird.

“Always inverse those window lickers at r/WallStreetBets . Seriously, I’ve seen some of them get halfway through “TA” using crayons and just eat the red crayon. Then they draw an up arrow with the green before eating it. They have achieved a level of idiocy that far exceeds the levels of intelligence even the best investors possess. As a result, simply doing the opposite of what they recommend is the best strategy” - Warren Buffet at Cambridge university 1989"
