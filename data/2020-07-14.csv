You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.

Was told they had room service before I drove out.

They don‚Äôt have room service. No biggie. 
Then I learn they won‚Äôt clean/make your room until you completely checkout. 
This is listed nowhere. 

Have to grab towels from the lobby or pool. 

Phones in the room don‚Äôt work. 
Front desk never answers no matter what time of day you call. 

Have to get new room keys made everyday. 
I‚Äôm on the 4th floor. Not cool. 

Elevator smashed & cut my foot because there isn‚Äôt a safety stop built in door. 
Some women where loading a giant cooler and I went to stop the door and it took me out. 


No first aid kit in whole hotel. 
Gave me bandaids from the lobby store
‚ÄúOn the house‚Äù.


The staff just seems completely lost.

I haven't gained or losss anything, I mean i've gained and then lost and ended up at the same lvl lol 

Theta gang is easy but with this market I only want to risk 20% of my acc at max, and not get wiped out with Collateral since I only sell credit spreads 2 week out, so I'm learning how to flip premium on C's mainly and just learning everything I can about the market and try to perfectly time my moves.

 Honestly, if I master the 5m chart I can probably pull out with a quick scalp on good days, but with RH delayed order fill, I only try to buy big dips like the one we had on a 20% risk. And most likely slowly average into long calls if we have a second bottom. < Hopefully, we will, and I won't miss out on TSLA again >

Fast forward 5 minutes into my nutsack-scratching session and I accidentally cut open a small portion of my skin near the balls. Blood starts to pour out faster than TSLA reached 1500. I scrambled to find some napkins but as I ran to kitchen, blood kept dripping from my severed nutsack. I turned to look at the bloody mess I had made and no bullshit, the trail of blood spelled out ‚Äúbear r fuk‚Äù. I scratched my balls a second time releasing even more blood from my severed nutsack. But alas, I had overdone it this time. I blacked out. When I woke up, there was a pool of blood in my kitchen. Written inside the blood was ‚ÄúGS will beat earnings‚Äù. No lie.

100 shares for these two should be right in budget, and if I sell 10-15% OTM calls I would bring in about $500/week. Not taking into account possibility of buying back lower and re deploying. And if they hit and get sold then I double that and look for another one lol.

Am I reading this right? Analysts are expecting an EPS of -0.56, even though SHOP has never had earnings that low in their entire existence?

Is it even possible for them to not bigly beat these expectations?

Required another vaccine two weeks later .. and barely they could quantify the amount of antibodies, and how long they last in the system.

Healthy people and kids when exposed to virus naturally , are mostly Asymptomatic, with no side effects. If this vaccine is given to people with compromised immune system and old, it will kill them just from the side effects.

1.	Top performing fund managers are poached by other funds or they start their own fund.
2.	Winning funds get an influx of capital which forces them to spread their money and attention too thin among too many companies
3.	They can't use risky or experimental strategies anymore.
4.	It costs more to trade stocks in very large blocks, the typical fund holds on to its stock for only 11 months at a time and it's hard to find buyers for billions worth of stock.
5.	Managers are forced to focus more on wealth preservation and become timid and imitative as they look to earn more through fees rather than returns. All big funds end up having the same portfolio."

Let's just say this vaccine works and works well. Full trial starts end of the month, second dose happens a month later, lets say results take another month to release. It's now October. Okay, we then only need to create 20 billion doses, distribute them around the world, and convince people that won't even wear a fucking mask to instead inject themselves with this (that once again has moderate side effects in over half of people!)

Meanwhile, we haven't even proven that the United States can maintain any sort of reopening without cases spiking, which will continue for at least another 6 months if even the most optimistic vaccine timeline turns out to be right.

So this is 'we should go back to ATHs' level of news how?"

‚ÄúA participant in the 250 mcg dose group had severe fever, onset the evening of the second vaccination, along with severe chills and mild fatigue, myalgia, and headache. In the early morning of the day after vaccination the participant developed recurrent severe fever, chills, fatigue, and headache, moderate myalgia and nausea, and mild arthralgia. The participant was evaluated in an urgent care center and received symptomatic treatment prior to discharge. A nasal swab specimen was negative for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and positive for adenovirus by a fluorescent antibody assay. After sleeping for several hours at home, upon standing the participant was lightheaded and nauseous, vomited, and then fainted. Lightheadedness persisted for several hours. Other systemic symptoms improved over the course of the day. Mild headache was present the next day and mild fatigue was reported through post vaccination day 6.
The unsolicited adverse events of lightheadedness and fainting (syncope) were judged as severe and related to vaccination and were classified as MedDRA¬Æ system organ class nervous system disorders (Table S3).‚Äù"

There was a really big group of dudes there who must have come together the way they were all hollering at each other and having a good time. Might be a bachelor outing or something. After a little while they sort of dragged me into the group with some casual banter and I ended up drinking quite heavily with these people. Shot after shot, pint after pint.

When the pub starts closing up they all start talking about keeping this shit going at one of the guys place and they ask me if I wanna come along. Drunk as a sailor in port I happily tag along. We reach this guys place and all start heading into the basement. Must have been just shy of twenty people.

The walls of this basement are chockfull of various leather outfits. Shorts, skirts, chapless pants, the whole bdsm catalouge. Everyone is getting into these outfits and start lubing each other up while I'm just looking in shock and awe at what the hell is going on. Then one guy points at me and says time for some lovin' new guy. I was promptly thrown on the floor and gangbanged by a dozen and a half macho dudes in leather gear. When I woke up the next day I had cum from my hair down to my toes, and I swear you could fit a basketball up my anus.

That was the gayest thing I had ever experienced until I listened to this Trump presser."

A random letter(s) will be selected based of a random letter generator.  These letters represent the ticker symbol.*

A coin will then be flipped, and the side facing up will indicate whether to buy a call or put.

It is up to the autist to decide what expiration, and strike price to select.

*If there is no ticker that matches the random letter generator, then the random generator process must be used until it comes out with a valid ticker.  The random number generator process will not be repeated, even if the ticker is invalid after the random letter generator process."

There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and those 2% savings accounts. 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz. Go for the millions.
