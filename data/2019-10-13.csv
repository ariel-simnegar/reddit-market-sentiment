It’s not entirely Trump’s fault we lost the phase I negotiations. It’s all because of his obsession with exporting soy, which apparently has a relationship with estrogen production. 

Trump’s overexposure to the soy is what turned him into a little bitch when he met with the Soyboys last week. Someone tell this man the Chinese are looking to import testosterone so he goes to a gay club or even r/wsb where we can only hope a big pair of balls rubs off on him before “phase II”"

With Netflix new OC being VERY hit or miss and a large overlap with Prime video content (and a large percentage of households have prime already) I think Netflix is going to have a very bad year next year.

Mix that in with if we DO go into a recession, there's no way people keep multiple ""nice to have"" similar services like Netflix. Given the choice, Amazon has more benefits along with a lot of the same content (and increasingly better OC) and Disney has solid OC... What does Netflix have to justify keeping them?"

But that was then, and this is now. It’s been 3 months and u/love2fukmarriedwoman hasn’t even looked in my direction since that night; that bold, adrenaline-filled night, where our bodies fused together in a mixture of bear and bull sweat.

But that was then. And this is now.

He left his job shortly after that, citing a need to “get outside, far from the virgins and bear fucks of the world.” It wasn’t until my boss hired me for a job on the Planetary Exchange of Needs, Information, and Society (PENIS) that I found him. 

It was up here, on the second oldest space station traveling from the moon to the Earth, that I found him at the helm of the ship. I recognized one of the girls from the meeting; u/fettywaap, who was taking bull cock deep in her throat. She fingered herself as tears streamed down her pretty 20-year-old face.

I coughed and they both stopped suddenly. Fetty leapt from the ground, red marks covering her knees. It was awkward for a moment, before Fetty rushed out of the room, leaving us alone against a backdrop of the great blue earth. 

“Why didn’t you call-“ I started.

“Stop,” he said.

“No. I deserve to know why you didn’t call-“

“I call when you’re married.”

“Huh?”

He leapt from his seat and hurried to me, my heart beating faster and faster with every step. He grabbed my hand and held it up to eye level.

“See? No ring. I only love to fuck married women- I don’t fuck around with singles. A chad like me has gotta eat sometime, kid. And I only eat pure, adultered pussy.”

He dropped my hand and laughed, before turning back around and pulling a cigar from his coat pocket. He lit it and puffed a couple times before saying:

“Send in u/Shmokesshweed for me. It’s been 3 minutes too long without my cock in a married girl’s mouth.” 

I said nothing, but turned around and walked into the hall. Shmokes was already there, her blonde hair curling down from her perfect face, a pair of bolt-ons Terry Dubrow would be proud of, and a perfect natural bubble butt just waiting to be spread. 

She glanced down at my hand and smirked as she held up hers. There was a large band around her finger that belonged to some poor soul fighting in Afghanistan. 

As I watched her bounce into the cockpit, a wild thought came into my mind. No, not a thought; an objective. An objective I was going to reach.

I’m going to find a cuck willing to put a ring around it. I’m going to fuck every last man on Earth to get what I want. And I don’t care How Long it’s going to take.

“Hey, Siri. Call u/ApartheidClyde.”"

Why does VIX only rise on sell-offs? I get that it's proportionate with volatility, but it seems that it's just a straight inverse of the market. What does VIX tell us that any other plain old inverse instrument doesn't?

Maybe I should put it this way:

I would expect to VIX to be flat/falling on most days and spike up on any spike up *or* down in the market. Sorta like a straddle."
