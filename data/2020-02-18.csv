2020-02-19 00:24:46,2-leet-2-compete,-5,"let's see if a pack of autists can answer something better than personalfinance:

How is the 15 vs. 20% long term capital gains rate triggered? Is it just determined by capital gains income, or is it total income, including any realized capital gains?

The threshold is about $400k for the federal cap gains rate to step up from 15 to 20%. If my normal income is say 100k, but and then in the same year I realize 400k in long term cap gains, does this mean that the first 300k of the 400k realized long term gains are taxed at 15%, and the remaining ~100k at 20%? Or would only the capital gains amount be considered, meaning in spite of my 100k normal income, the entire 400k (just shy of the threshold) would only be hit by 15% capital gains tax?"

You see Tesla, you look at the financials and the promises that will ultimately fall short for the time being. You say hey, Tesla shouldn't be valued much over 500 with it's current production and finances. You go short, you get destroyed. Meanwhile some 18 year old on stocktwits with his first 1000 bucks banks it. 

So you think, aye fuck that kid. Obviously SPCE is way overvalued up in the high 20s. Company won't even have any revenues for a few years, even then it's a niche amusement park ride. I'll short this. Boom, dead again. Meanwhile some autistic half retarded loner made a million and now you are 100 grand in student loan debt plus lost all your investors money.

* Do you feel like posting the sick gains on WSB showing everyone how your 0.50 .09 delta calls are now $8 ITM and is up 4000%? You should probably sell.

* Is it an amount that will cause any of your immediate family members to go ""oh shit that's a lot of money?"" Then you should probably sell.

Ppl toss around ""life changing money"" a lot and I feel the immediate family barometer is a good gauge. It's easy to get tunnel vision in WSB land as as the green candle keeps showing up one after another - you'd think oh shit it's gonna go from 400% to 800%.

Buyers (bidders) try and get the cheapest price for an item, sellers (askers) try and get the highest price for an item. The stock market is the same, and it shows the price at which buyers and sellers would be matched if they were to agree to a transaction at this very moment. If all the buyers disappear and someone tries to sell at the lowest price, it's likely that they will get a really bad and unfair price. Also, just because a buyer and seller are specifying which prices they would buy and sell at, that does not mean anyone has actually traded at that price. So before you come screaming onto WSBs ruining my god damn peace like the dipshit you are, look up how a fucking market works on Investopedia or go back to r/all."

2020-02-18 23:20:46,flowkingfresh,23,"> Derivatives that can extract even more gains from Virgin Galactic have become a favorite among retail investors, judging by activity on message boards like r/wallstreetbets. When a fresh option is written, a dealer who sells it will typically hedge their exposure by buying a certain amount of the stock so as not to accumulate a short position, and will tend to buy more shares in the event of a continued rally. Some traders have seized onto this dynamic as evidence that their options-buying activity is sufficient to perpetuate a rally in the underlying stock.

I was too busy taking a Finance test on which I did poorly because I'm feverish from the flu which I recently contracted when my toddler threw up all over me, twice. There are no makeup tests so I couldn't take a sick day. A laptop is required to take the test so I bring my janky ass laptop from the 00s to class. It decides to disconnect from WiFi a quarter of the way through the test and won't let me reconnect without closing the test window (and failing). The prof takes pity and gives me a loaner laptop. That one won't connect to the test either. Finally he gives me a paper test which I then had to complete in half the time. Me and everyone in my house has the flu and is vomiting and liquid shitting all day long. The test questions just pissed me off. Questions about mortgages just reminded me I have to rent. Questions about future value of investments assuming 10% gains each year... bitch I don't have any gains. Questions about how much should the parents set aside each year for their child's college or to buy them a car... bitch my parents owe ME money. Everywhere I look in this classroom are 19 year old hotties in yoga pants meanwhile me & the wife haven't had uninterrupted sex in weeks it's like a goddamn covert operation to not wake the kids.

Biggest loss: 100 AAPL shares (-585), from 325P I sold on friday that was assigned. Nice recovery from -1K this morning.

Other random good positions: 8x /NQ calls bought on yesterdays dip at ~-0.70%, up +1K.. sold 2 of them for +500 profit. short TSLA 835P, bought back for +448. TSLA 1000C 2/28, +1.6K. Also some AAPL 2/21 315Ps, bought back today for +300 profit.

Some random bad positions: ROKU 135C 2/28, -558. VMW 165C 2/28, -264. BMY 70C 3/6, -300.
