I noted [last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5fnmd/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_18/fhzgsin/) that the drop this morning was not going to be anything special and it wasn't. We hit support at 335.22, which was basically the 335.3 number I noted [last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) As soon as we hit it, the market went right back to mooning. With repo in play and nothing on the economic calendar, [futures already back-filling its gap,](https://imgur.com/aQeCTBF) and Asian markets going green, it looks like market retardation is not going to cool off and all crayon lines remain intact.

Resistance tomorrow at 338.9, support at the same 335.2ish as today. Good luck tomorrow and get your tendies."

Look at that fucking chart. They started ramping up buybacks to unprecedented levels in 2005, and except for a brief recession pause, they never stopped. Fake market.  


>Diver said buybacks “have grown to become the single most important source of demand for US Corporate equity, especially in recent years when some traditional sources of demand such as active mutual funds and pension funds have been net sellers.”   


Nobody is fucking buying stock. These motherfuckers are just buying their own stock during low volume to drive up the price. Buybacks should be illegal. Pay a goddamn dividend if you don't know what to do with your cash."

How is the 15 vs. 20% long term capital gains rate triggered? Is it just determined by capital gains income, or is it total income, including any realized capital gains?

The threshold is about $400k for the federal cap gains rate to step up from 15 to 20%. If my normal income is say 100k, but and then in the same year I realize 400k in long term cap gains, does this mean that the first 300k of the 400k realized long term gains are taxed at 15%, and the remaining ~100k at 20%? Or would only the capital gains amount be considered, meaning in spite of my 100k normal income, the entire 400k (just shy of the threshold) would only be hit by 15% capital gains tax?"

Meanwhile some 18 year old on stocktwits with his first 1000 bucks banks it.

2020-02-18 23:45:02,freehouse_throwaway,29,"Given stonks are only going up and we're in a period of bonkers market... If you're ever up bigly. There are some good rules to whether or not you should take gains:

* Do you feel like posting the sick gains on WSB showing everyone how your 0.50 .09 delta calls are now $8 ITM and is up 4000%? You should probably sell.

* Is it an amount that will cause any of your immediate family members to go ""oh shit that's a lot of money?"" Then you should probably sell.

Ppl toss around ""life changing money"" a lot and I feel the immediate family barometer is a good gauge. It's easy to get tunnel vision in WSB land as as the green candle keeps showing up one after another - you'd think oh shit it's gonna go from 400% to 800%.

If it's simply about chasing returns. Take a good chunk of profit and leave some to ride, or roll it to something less retarded than Friday expiry."

Buyers (bidders) try and get the cheapest price for an item, sellers (askers) try and get the highest price for an item. The stock market is the same, and it shows the price at which buyers and sellers would be matched if they were to agree to a transaction at this very moment. If all the buyers disappear and someone tries to sell at the lowest price, it's likely that they will get a really bad and unfair price. Also, just because a buyer and seller are specifying which prices they would buy and sell at, that does not mean anyone has actually traded at that price. So before you come screaming onto WSBs ruining my god damn peace like the dipshit you are, look up how a fucking market works on Investopedia or go back to r/all."

I want to avoid IV crush, but I still want to make tendies on this potential earning beat and short squeeze. Should I buy calls further out, like 2-3 months out at higher strikes? Will that save me from the IV crush if the beat and squeeze is not enough to bring my calls in the money?

When a fresh option is written, a dealer who sells it will typically hedge their exposure by buying a certain amount of the stock so as not to accumulate a short position, and will tend to buy more shares in the event of a continued rally. Some traders have seized onto this dynamic as evidence that their options-buying activity is sufficient to perpetuate a rally in the underlying stock.

I was too busy taking a Finance test on which I did poorly because I'm feverish from the flu which I recently contracted when my toddler threw up all over me, twice. There are no makeup tests so I couldn't take a sick day. A laptop is required to take the test so I bring my janky ass laptop from the 00s to class. It decides to disconnect from WiFi a quarter of the way through the test and won't let me reconnect without closing the test window (and failing). The prof takes pity and gives me a loaner laptop. That one won't connect to the test either. Finally he gives me a paper test which I then had to complete in half the time. Me and everyone in my house has the flu and is vomiting and liquid shitting all day long. The test questions just pissed me off. Questions about mortgages just reminded me I have to rent. Questions about future value of investments assuming 10% gains each year... bitch I don't have any gains. Questions about how much should the parents set aside each year for their child's college or to buy them a car... bitch my parents owe ME money. Everywhere I look in this classroom are 19 year old hotties in yoga pants meanwhile me & the wife haven't had uninterrupted sex in weeks it's like a goddamn covert operation to not wake the kids.
