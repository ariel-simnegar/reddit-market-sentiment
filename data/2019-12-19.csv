Takeda - potential 1 billion dollar oncology deal on the horizon

(RCUS) Arcus and or Roche - team up for new colorectal and pancreatic cancer trials 

Concert pharmaceuticals - completed open label trial for patients, probably a non mover and shaker unlike the others

Kodiak sciences appointed Taiyin Yang PhD to board of directors. Dudes a rock star

Scholar Rock - new company on Nasdaq exchange

2019-12-19 21:29:42,Smart202020,9,"Has anyone had this happen? You are out of day trades and want to lock in a profit mid-day. You sell a call option at a higher strike, and you watch the stock continue to moon and into after hours. You realize by the next day if you’d just not done anything, you’d have made double or triple your original “locked in” profit amount. It makes me sick. I hate vertical spreads for this reason"

The TSLA 420 and 435's I wrote last week are now looming.

I fat fingered a single ROKU call today... but bought 11 instead of 1. Promptly lost money and now I'm bag holding 5 of them 12/27.

My AXSM shares I've held all year, I didn't sell at the peak today. Yes, yes, I didn't know it was going to dive a bit. I'm expecting its second drug news next week to catapult it to $110."

2019-12-19 21:15:37,knotswag,29,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Crayons have been really consistent this week, as the projections from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecim3m/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_19/fbc07d6/) came to pass. Impeachment, bad jobs data, lowering home sales and manufacturing were shrugged off because we were about to break below bullish support. We're still just at support today for closing and because of that, without major bad news tomorrow I expect us to go green again tomorrow. The bad news that could hit is GDP, which has not missed projections badly since about 2017. 

Not much else to add. Ranges tomorrow is 320.65 to 322.4. Good luck out there and let's get those tendies."
