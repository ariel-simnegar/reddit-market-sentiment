Vice Premier Liu He, who will lead negotiations for China, told dignitaries that his offer to the U.S. will not include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or government subsidies, according to to Bloomberg. These are among the Trump administration's main demands in the trade talks.

China’s leadership “are interpreting the impeachment discussion as a weakening of Trump’s position, or certainly a distraction,” said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China’s elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“Their calculation is that Trump needs a win” and is willing to make compromises on substance as a result, he said.


White House trade policy director Peter Navarro, however, denied those reports and called them ""fake news."""

We talked to her a bit then continued on our date. The chick I was with told me how the stripper girl was super into her, and I joked that maybe we should have a threesome. She looked me dead in the eye sockets and said, ""I could probably make that happen tonight, but you should know, if it does, this will probably be our last date.""

Even if trump is desperate for a trade deal, I think china has a good position to not agree to anything. The impeachment talks and the fact that there's only a year left in his term means that there's light at the end of the tunnel for them if they just bide their time. Additionally, if trade talks fail, it fucks up his chances of a second term which means there would be higher chances of a democrat president. All of which seem to have a platform focused domestic politics.

And I don't believe trump even needs to get a trade deal either. If the trade talks fail because china won't offer ANY kind of concessions, trump has an out of blaming the democrats. Every success is because of him, and every failure is due to dEeP sTAtE rOGuEs. He can claim that the impeachment process was deliberately sabotaged by the democrats to make him look bad, or drag down the market to hurt his re-election."
