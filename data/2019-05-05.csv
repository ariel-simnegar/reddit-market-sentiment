2019-05-06 06:20:18,SvenTropics,19,"What happened was a pretty obvious prediction for most of us. 

1. Trump adds 10% tariffs. 
2. Chinese say, ""we can't negotiate until you remove tariffs because we won't negotiate if you put a gun to our heads"". 
3. Trump plans 25% tariffs.
4. Suddenly Xi does the meeting and they postpone tariffs for 3 months.
5. Chinese are strangely too busy to even begin discussing it until they have less than a month left. Deadline gets removed.
6. Negotiations move very slowly with very slow gradual concessions. Chinese are trying to wait out the clock and hope Trump loses in 2020 and the new president is less interested in a trade war.
7. Trump finally gets impatient and threatens more tariffs if a trade deal doesn't get done soon because he needs a win for the entry into the 2020 race. After all, no wall and a hefty boost to the deficit makes him look bad. Deal with China = Good and everyone's 401k's will look good too. 
8. China will suddenly make all kinds of verbal concessions to extend that deadline, but drag out getting it written down saying that the details are complicated and have multiple layers of approval necessary. 
9. goto step 6

&#x200B;

The truth is China doesn't want a deal. Any deal means they lose. So, they are solidifying their position with the rest of the world (new Europe deal, Russia deal, etc...) as a means to leverage the USA into basically dropping the trade war.

 Before you go buying puts or calls, please know how much volatility plays into the premium of the options that you are buying. Because SPY is taking such a heavy dump, premiums on those options (calls and puts) will rise because volatility is rising. 

This is prime time selling for options sellers because people who have no idea what they are doing (especially those who THINK they know what they are doing) are going to bet more heavily on which way this is going to swing. When volatility lowers, which it may over the upcoming days, the value of that option will lower.

The majority of options expire worthless. Always keep this in mind. Stay safe out there, y'all."

Thursday: Markets open green after rumors of an iminent trade deal. China releases statement denying that any trade negotiations are currently on-going. Markets swing wildly, everyone loses money.
