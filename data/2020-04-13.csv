mortgage reits. RH lists 366 REITS. not all of them are tradeable, but its a good way to follow how these companies are doing with rent. in the past 2 weeks theyve been green green and only green. literally only ~.05% of reits closed red for those 2 weeks. 

yesterday 80% of reits on RH bled red. on one hand you could say ""sure, everything else is red, why wouldnt reits"" but its because the vast majority of businesses, large and small, are trying to find a way to deal with these property costs- and the simplest way is to just not pay them. 

you want to track the market? use reits. i expect them to be green/flat today through thursday, but they'll bleed hard on friday and thats when everyone should buy their puts"
