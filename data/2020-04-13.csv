mortgage reits. RH lists 366 REITS. not all of them are tradeable, but its a good way to follow how these companies are doing with rent. in the past 2 weeks theyve been green green and only green. literally only ~.05% of reits closed red for those 2 weeks. 

yesterday 80% of reits on RH bled red. on one hand you could say ""sure, everything else is red, why wouldnt reits"" but its because the vast majority of businesses, large and small, are trying to find a way to deal with these property costs- and the simplest way is to just not pay them. 

you want to track the market? use reits. i expect them to be green/flat today through thursday, but they'll bleed hard on friday and thats when everyone should buy their puts"

The good news is you are almost certainly right we are in for a drop and likely retest the lows or even fall right past them.

The bad news is your puts will probably expire worthless before it happens. It is probably closer to the end of the summer before it gets there. 

All the optimism for the recovery is based on us flattening the curve. That is only happened by being in lockdown. Right now it's estimated that up to 2M are actively infected in the US. Now consider how quickly things popped off when there were just a few thousand cases. Now imagine relaxing the rules even 50% when it is seeded 1000x higher. 

Things will loosen up at the end of May or June. We will have 30 days where professionals are raising alarms but certain politicians and media will say ""no biggie"" and then infections go parabolic again.

Tldr; right now the market thinks we are on the other side of this because the curve was flattened as a result of a shutdown country. Wait until the market starts to realize that we are still in the 2nd inning and turns. Better to be a little late than early on your puts."

Reserves will skyrocket and dividends will be limited beyond what was forecasted, even though Jamie was given the green light to hand out free cash to wealthy shareholders. 

What makes this play attractive is the seismic CECL regulation that was recently implemented, and analysts don‚Äôt understand how conservative these ‚Äòblack-box‚Äô reserve estimates can be, nor do they understand how they apply the inputs...and likely the JPM back office folks don‚Äôt know wtf is going on either.

Because of this, Russel investors will flee to the big companies and the S&P will be the last bastion of returns as everything else burns around it. That's already happening with the Nasdaq vs the S&P right? NQ/QQQ is holding up way better than ES/SPY, which is doing better than the Russel futures/ETF equivalents. Maybe shorting SPY isn't the answer if all the capital is going to flee to it while everything else crashes and burns."

I treat this as though I‚Äôm really a spy because I have to interact with the far right but they think I‚Äôm one of them. I‚Äôm actually a centrist who believes in science and liberal dogma like equal rights for all races, a good and free public education, vaccinations against measles and polio, and laws banning forced child labor.

Many of these right wingers are telling me that Covid 19 is good because it‚Äôs culling the herd. It‚Äôs only killing the old, weak, and worthless who are parasites on the system. Eventually with all of these deaths the burden on social security, pension systems, Medicare, and SNAP will become less and it will be a net positive.

No one in their right mind would say this publicly but could the markets be acting as they are because this is what they are seeing? I think this is all bullshit, I‚Äôm a gay bear who, was up initially 1000% and now up only 500% but Why the fuck are the markets continuing to climb? This will be much worse than the Great Depression although maybe not as long. looking for someone to tell me this is an insane argument and give me the reasons why.

I'm bagholding SPY puts with an exp 5/15

250/245/240 total purchase price $46,500

I unfortunately bought these after a small rally to $247 on Apr 2. right before Trump's oil tweet... also want to note that I made a $15k gain on SPY puts the day before buying (Sold at $244)

I am never one to hold a position longer than a day or two at most.. however what fucked me is that I wasn't able to trade on a Friday due to work, and when Monday came around I literally lost 50% in value... 

Since then I have been awaiting an exit position which proves to a missed target day after day.. I never anticipated the rally and fed influence that we are experiencing, as I bought these before that was as apparent as it is now. 

I am poised and ready to exit these positions in the AM just so I can regroup and trade according to the current market we are in vs. waiting for these to recoup losses...

I know I am not going to get serious replies, and everyone is going to crack gay bear jokes and brrrrr all over my intentions of this comment... however, my question is am I in the right frame of mind to exit these positions at a $33k+ loss or would it be in my best interest to wait out this week given earnings and guidance..?

Serious responses are greatly appreciated, bullshit brrrrr responses, and gay bear fuck shit responses also appreciated for comic relief...

The first one is free...Why is that? 

The first options you purchase is usually something youve been watching. Something you've traded chairs on. So you're half ass expecting it to go up anyways. In most cases you'll buy to open a call.

You'll watch as your % return goes up 3% then 50% ""holy shit"" you'll think. Why have i been trading chairs for months on end? So youll start reading tons of boring shit about fd's, strategies, wsb's, etc. Youll try and get *smart* about it, trying different shit, but you just cant hit that dopamine rush again. How did  you make consistent returns early on, then it all went to shit? Its simple really....

Just buy calls.

Honestly not surprised by this shit. Small Caps and most Banks haven‚Äôt even touched the .382 fib retracement from the top in Feb down to the low in Mar.

On top of just the .382 fib (May even be a .5 fib retracement) a fucking enormous gap to fill - something like 7-8%+ for the banks.

Take into account the NASDAQ and S&P 500 touching their .5 fibs.

But also, I could see a hard rally tomorrow - maybe slight pull back end of day. Wed we go up for most part before paring back some gains.

Has really genius pharmacotherapies on paper. The problem: they don't work well for some reason. In brief, instead of using a patient's own antibodies, they use a donors antibodies for treatments. Essentially they are uselessly commercializing and complicating a process that works fine just using your own serum. 

The main drug they are banking on is ATA-129 and it will not work, and they are still 8 years away. First in person treatment was 2014 and they are still in phase 1, absolutely glacial. The drug's incredibly safe and they're just crawling. 

Enrollment's bad and the hypothesis that treating the EBV component of MS is contradicted by the fact that Natalizumab (the most effective MS drug, even though it really isn't hardly) increases EBV dramatically.

Second problem: It's down from 40 to 8 and can't go low enough. Or they could be acquired. But if it goes way back up, short it?"

However, if things get worse, he now can campaign on the premise that the Dems were wrong, Nancy Pelosi would‚Äôve killed people if she had her way, and that he took things seriously when it mattered. Saved ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of lives.‚Äù Seems like the narrative they tried to shift to today. 

Of course it‚Äôs all my opinion, might be reading into it too much. But this positioning before the supposed peak of cases (while sneakily doubling down on PPE/vents) is very interesting. 

Am I retarded or just autistic?"

Obviously COVID-19, but before that there was a global demand for the US Dollar. COVID-19 was just a trigger and caused more stress.

The Federal Reserve actually has 3 mandates (3.5 if you halfway included the stock market lol).

1. Maximum Employment
2. Stable Prices
3. US Dollar maintains Global Reserve Currency Status

The Federal Reserve will print as much US Dollars as people demand across the globe and they will defend their global reserve status. Whether it's eventually worth less than the paper they print it on, we will see since we don't have a gold standard anymore.

But as Americans, it will benefit us massively to retain our reserve currency status. But more specifically, it benefits our government to maintain our financial supremacy in a growing multi-polarity world."

...Doesn't that mean rates are artificially low and the market is rejecting JPow's bullshit? Because that is how I read it. There's a huge fucking liquidity crisis but rates are still under 4% for a 30 year fixed? Come the fuck on. The market is pulling violently in a different direction than the fed.

‚ÄúMarkets experience primary trends which last a year or more, such as a bull or bear market. Within these broader trends, they experience secondary trends, often working against the primary trend, such as a pullback within a bull market or a rally within a bear market; these secondary trends last from **three weeks to three months**. Finally, there are minor trends lasting less than three weeks, which are largely noise.‚Äù"
