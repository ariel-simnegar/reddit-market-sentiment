So they just liquidated the balance of their May futures yesterday between (what was the days range - ~13 to -38) to buy June futures that have already lost >30% in value today. It’s the start of June futures so the only good scenario is July goes deep negative and they can pickup contracts and cash. Otherwise when they roll from June to July they are going to take a huge loss and pick up fewer contracts.

And, without USO buying up the market what happens to futures prices?

Edit: as pointed out they completed their roll last week but they still are losing their shirt on June.

Also, why would anyone hold USO long term? Their performance is terrible. See:
