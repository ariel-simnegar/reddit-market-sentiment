So they just liquidated the balance of their May futures yesterday between (what was the days range - ~13 to -38) to buy June futures that have already lost >30% in value today. It‚Äôs the start of June futures so the only good scenario is July goes deep negative and they can pickup contracts and cash. Otherwise when they roll from June to July they are going to take a huge loss and pick up fewer contracts.

And, without USO buying up the market what happens to futures prices?

Edit: as pointed out they completed their roll last week but they still are losing their shirt on June.

Also, why would anyone hold USO long term? Their performance is terrible. See:

https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/who-was-forced-liquidate-oil-today-goldman-answers

> In terms of holders, the surge in retail interest in recent weeks -- as illustrated by the USO ETF which now represents 30% of the June WTI contract open interest -- suggests that retail positions (in outright WTI contracts rather than systematically rolling products) were likely still long May WTI contracts into this week and now forced sellers (consistent with the sell-off accelerating in the 30 minutes ahead of the close and the sharp rebound that followed).

‚ÄúAnd so it was once again the mom and pop daytraders and r/wallstreebets amateurs, who however have felt quite professional if not invincible, thanks to the Fed's constant market manipulation and bailout out of every crash... but not in the commodity sector. It was they that suffered unprecedented losses having held on to a contract they did not understand, and without realizing that they faced not only a total wipe out, but a wipe out more than 100% of their invested capital, a privilege traditionally only reserves for short sellers.‚Äù"

2020-04-21 06:56:18,SolitaryEgg,19,"I'm gonna give you guys some real DD: this market is honestly retarded, and trying to analyze stocks by p/e and shit doesn't work. Investors are just throwing money at shit based on trends and sentiment. Like seriously, look at ZM's p/e, it's fucking hilarious. 

Here's what does work (in the short term): buying options on news. Like that GILD play of buying puts after a rally on news was braindead, but it worked.

Today, for example, the restaurant sector was way down. Everything was down 3-5%, except for one: cheesecake factory. Why? Some news came out about an investment, and their stock rallied to +8% midday. I bought puts there, because the euphoria rally will wear off and it'll drill right back down to match all the other restaurants that are fucking closed. It was already half way there EOD, closing at only +2%.

Don't overthink it. It really is that simple. Finding anomalies within a sector and playing fake/gay crashes and rallies will work a majority of the time."

And joy started off aplenty,

We will have a month of smoking weed!

And fate said 'indeed.'

'Sike,' said fate,

'What you will have is Australia ablaze,

And thats just a part 

For this is only the start,

Send a missile at Iran,

And kill the Salami Man,

 Await a war with them

Instead Trump will tweet 'All is Well!'

But it is not, 

For some Chinese will have a nose full of snot,

After eating a bat and a rat,

He'll cough and sneeze,

Causing economic activity to cease,

Here's the roaring 20's all over again!

Plague and war never leave

Neither do stock market peaks,

And watch it crash down,

Until a man named JPow,

Came about 

And said 

'Fear not, for I will stop the asset price fade,

I will overclock my printers and buy everything in sight,

And thats not all, I will show America's economic might!

Rain down dollar bills to appease the poor 

While telling them they deserve no more.

Inflation might run rampant but thats a risk Im willing to take,

Because after all, money is fake!

Asset prices will inflate

But that is the will of Fate."

2020-04-21 05:50:44,hodlforlyfe,18,"A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago.

Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?"

Smart money are selling you those calls into rollover 60% contango. USO now holds a lot of June contracts and unless we see demand ramping up significantly in a month which is doubtful - same fade will wait June contracts that are currently priced at 22$. Even if they settle at 15$ this would negatively impact uso value of around -40%

>  
>If you bought leaps for the same amount of cash what does that get you? Let's say the contract costs $20 (current RH bid price) for simplicity again. So that gets you 50 contracts to buy 100 shares each.  
>  
>Alright so, let's say in one year that XOM's price goes up to $50. Well if you bought shares then you would have an increase of $10\*2500, or $25k, a 25% return. Add dividend of 8% (I'm going to simplify and use the current yield of the stock on the $100k), and you have about 33%.  
>  
>Now for the leaps, let's just use the greeks for that contract you mentioned. It has a delta of about .95 and gamma of .0047 and theta of -.0017. That $10 increase in underlying means your contract will be worth about:

>$20 (base cost) + (10\*.9992( approx of delta + gamma over for $10) - (365\*.0017(theta)

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

2020-04-21 02:52:33,USFederalReserve,17,"### FOR THOSE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF KIM'S POTENTITAL DEATH

- NK is a strategic buffer zone between China and SK. SK can basically be presumed to be synonymous with the US. 

- NK is a humanitarian crisis, whoever takes responsibility for NK's people will have quite the problem, and that's without a pandemic that has found it's way into NK. 

- NK has nukes, and if a trigger happy general takes over and decides to use it, it would be a huge moment for history. Although SK's defense would likely knock it out of the air without issue.

- Ask yourself, if NK is dissolved, who gets the land? SK? China? Do either of them even want it? Would both prefer a buffer zone instead?

- What about the NK soldiers? Who disarms them? How many of them agree that their state has been absorbed? On top of that, what happens if they begin having a civil war within themselves? 

- Saying it again just because it's super important: NK has nukes. 

THIS is why it's more important/effective on the market right now compared to unemployment, corona, ect. This is a true diplomatic crisis that could very very easily spin out of control depending on who decides to be an aggressor here.

EDIT: SK saying it's fake was tweeted after I wrote this. I will say there is a strategic advantage for SK pretending to not know about this, and the US has confirmed it's CIA source, so I'd say it's not 100% unproven yet. I'm waiting for more information."

So...why not have USO roll out of their contracts 2-3 weeks before the largest May drop in history. Trigger a mass sell-off literally the day before the contract expires. -40/bb meaning the FED/oil big boys can swoop in and get paid to take oil off the hands of the oil companies in somewhat of a bond like fashion. Store it in whatever US reserves we have for cheap. Then offload that shit once oil goes back to equilibrium (as the world opens up) in the future forcing consumers to incure the prices. Oil companies win short term. And the economy gets protection short-medium term. Oil going to -40 just doesn't make any sense. Even the crazy USO volume.

Time's have changed
Our kids are getting worse
They won't obey their parents
They just want to fart and curse

Should we blame the government?
Or blame society?
Or should we blame the images on TV?

No, blame Canada, blame Canada
With all their beady little eyes
And flappin' heads so full of lies

Blame Canada, blame Canada
We need to form a full assault
It's Canada's fault

Don't blame me for my son Stan
He saw the darn cartoon
And now he's off to join the Klan

And my boy Eric once
Had my picture on his shelf
But now when I see him he tells me to fuck myself

Well, blame Canada, blame Canada
It seems that everything's gone wrong
Since Canada came along

Blame Canada, blame Canada
There not even a real country anyway

My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true
Instead he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue

Should we blame the matches?
Should we blame the fire?
Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?
Heck no

Blame Canada, blame Canada
With all their hockey hullabaloo
And that bitch Anne Murray too
Blame Canada, shame on Canada

The smut we must stop, the trash we must smash
Laughter and fun must all be undone
We must blame them and cause a fuss
Before someone thinks of blaming us"

More than 300 Amazon employees will call out of work starting Tuesday in protest of the online retail giant's treatment of workers during the coronavirus pandemic.

The¬†call out is organized by labor groups United for Respect, New York Communities for Change, and Make The Road New York¬†and will be the largest mass action by workers yet amid the crisis.

The nationwide protest follows several strikes at facilities in Staten Island, Chicago and Detroit where employees have tested positive to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling out this week because I‚Äôm scared to come to work and can‚Äôt trust Amazon to keep me and my co-workers safe,‚Äù Jaylen Camp, an Amazon worker at¬†a fulfillment center in Romulus, Michigan, said.

‚ÄúWe have to make an impossible choice every day: go to a workplace that‚Äôs not safe or risk losing a paycheck in the middle of a global recession. Rather than take real steps to protect our health, Amazon would rather stall, lie, and fire the people who speak up. We will not be intimidated. Our health and everyone‚Äôs health is too important.‚Äù

Over 130¬†Amazon facilities have had at least one employee test positive for COVID-19, according to the Athena Coalition, which is made up of advocacy groups focused on working conditions at Amazon.

The company last week confirmed the first death of a warehouse worker from the disease, although it remains unknown where the worker contracted it.

Amazon has taken steps to address some of the issues raised by workers, including¬†pledging to increase cleaning and enforce social distancing measures at warehouses.

It has also¬†raised wages for hourly workers by $2 per hour and offered paid time for those with fevers, a common symptom of COVID-19.

Workers say Amazon has not fulfilled its commitment to provide personal protective equipment for workers and that the paid leave policy has not been applied consistently.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the¬†call out.

The very oil that is being produced is essentially a waste product of a process that‚Äôs being run to maintain oil production capacity in the hopes that the same oil will no longer be a waste product in a few months. 

If this rock-bottom demand stays for a few more months, and minimum production necessary to maintain capacity **continues** to be below demand/storage, every single oil producer in the US may have to consider bankruptcy. This includes the big boys, because they‚Äôll just have more assets to maintain and more oil to store. 

These bankruptcies would fuck the books of thousands of small banks, and profoundly impact the willingness to lend from larger institutions. 

This could be **WAY** bigger than the COVID lockdown. There‚Äôs no way to print the problem away, either, as it‚Äôs a storage/demand issue, and not a liquidity crisis."

2020-04-21 00:06:25,Osmosis_Bones13,4,"Nice write up on oil prices I found. Part of the problem is also the way the USO ETF (which owns something like 25% of the oil contracts) is made. Here's how I understand it.
People don't want to trade actual contracts, instead, they just want to trade the price of oil. SO a bank came up with an idea called a ETF. It's an intermediary where you buy ETF ""stock"" like any other stock in a trading platform (Ameritrade, robinhood, etc) and the bank then uses that money to buy the underlying asset. In this case, that underlying asset is the crude oil. The value of the USO ETF should track that underlying oil assets. But here is the problem.
The USO ETF doesn't run a basic underlying asset (like stock). Oil is a rolling asset. In other words, the bank running the USO bank buys May contracts (that expire April 21st) in March-April (or something) and then sells them in May before they expire. When it sells the May contracts, it uses that money to buy up June assets and continues on and on.
Well, the USO ETF was overbought, and now the bank is trying to unload all of the shitty ETFs at the end of the month (Contracts expire April 21st) and nobody who actually uses barrels wants to buy them because storage is likely to be full next month. So they are pushing the price down. A desperate seller and no buyers: that's a recipe for negative prices.

So yeah, it's a market fuck up. It doesn't actually reflect the real price of oil barrels being sold. To see that, you have to look at the EIA data for the actual price that refineries paid to buy oil. It also lags months behind.
https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_rac2_dcu_nus_m.htm
Also, a better tracker of spot prices is to look at futures contracts (which un-surprisingly are also down next month).
https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html

tdwidk: Oil isn't trading negative money per barrel. It is actually still costing around 45 a barrel but dependent on export or import. Just a means for banks to pressure it down and unload contracts which nobody wants to buy cause all the stock is full baby. Eia.gov link it nice for actual prices now and not the contract right to buy barrels cause of course that is gonna suck dick"

They're holding it steadily where we are. As long as the negative days are weak, minimal, and spread out with multiple green days between them, even holding steady here for a while would be fine - kill time until volatility is dead and then they can unload their balance sheet. 

Robinhood's CEO said tonight in march their deposit volume was 17x December 2019. 17x! People going long. 50% of all new brokerage accounts are on RH - tards who are FOMOing and other autists averaging down. 

I thought these rapid ups/downs would continue but the volume has died - truly if we had one large volume red day can anyone even argue that we wouldn't hit 5-6% easy. the funds have gone cash and are waiting. Prob already hedged. The momentum is dead, for now. But the laughable manipulation can only continue for so long as the situation worsens - now way beyond covid."

2020-04-20 23:49:46,jinxy0320,7,It doesn't matter if the economy opens back up. At anything below a certain demand level (aka gross rev) anything that is even remotely a mid to low margin and a brick&mortar will be better served not opening back up due to the volume of business not being nearly enough to cover their fixed costs to justify continued operations. This means slow rampup in employment if at all and a death spiral of consumption collapse.

2020-04-20 23:10:11,Odamanma,3,"Srs question: How many sqf is 1000bbl of oil? And what would the transport costs from Cushing to the nearest plot of land?

Right now you can buy 10 acres of land in Cushing for like $30k (source: realtor.com). If you took delivery of a few hundred thousand barrels of crude in Cushing, then paid to ship them down the road and put them on your new property... 

You'd make easily enough to pay for the property in cash if you're taking delivery at -$22/bbl.... From there... even if someone stole your oil (they would be doing you a favor) you'd end up banking hard from getting paid for the oil, plus you'd have a sweet piece of land paid in full also.

Thanks for using Robinhood and for reaching out about your USO puts.
If a liquidation were to occur on USO, it would really depend on what the adjusted deliverable becomes on the contract. This is determined by the issuing company, and then the OCC will handle the settlement of the contracts.

If the shares are not trading, due to the liquidation, but your puts are in the money, you would likely get the difference between the payout of the liquidation, and the strike price of your option but it is hard to say exactly what will happen without the event occurring and the terms being set.

$OILD (3x short crude) just went through a liquidation, so I will attach the memo from The OCC so you have an idea of how these get processed. 
Let me know if you have any questions, I‚Äôm happy to help."

At this line:

2020-04-20 22:00:12,ekozie,3,"I can't believe how much time I wasted dicking around with EURN calls (though they're still printing) before I did some DD into NAT.  I don't love DHT because they already contracted out a lot of their fleet for long-term storage, and at only moderately gouging prices.  Need to learn more about TNK and FRO (though it looks like those entry points have become unattractive.  Shame on me for missing them yesterday and this AM).

NAT (around $5) comes with a .14 dividend ex-5/22, which I'm going to consider a discount on the purchase price.  If I were to hold it past May, that becomes a yield of 11-12% depending on entry point.  NAT is announcing earnings on 5/18.  This is expected to be the first quarter in a long time with solid earnings and cash flow, even though it's mostly before the massive tanker rental price increase.  Analysts haven't touched their EPS estimates for the quarter, year, or 2021 yet ***at all***.  Debt exists, but is manageable and being paid down, and free cash flow is increasing bigly.  They could probably use some free cash to retire more debt and will definitely return some to shareholders.

What's amazing is this is mostly the situation **before** the oil glut and coronavirus pandemic!  Tanker rental rates have skyrocketed, which is going to megacharge earnings and free cash flow, for at least the next few months (is two quarters too much to ask for?).  Tankers sheltering in place reduces expenses slightly as well.  With lending rates so low and strong assets to back up the business (\~1.3billion to about 400 mil in debt), I could definitely see new debt being issued to retire old debt at lower rates.  I wouldn't be shocked to see an increase in dividend, as even in loss-making quarters NAT has shown an extreme dedication to returning value to investors through dividends.

There's going to be a lot of very, very good news coming for this company in the next month, both rearward- and forward-looking.  They got their shit figured out just in time to take advantage of these incredible ~~generational~~ first time ever conditions (we've never seen oil in super contango like this, ever, in the history of oil).  I easily see NAT trading up to their 8ish year highs in the mid-teens within the next few months.  Yes, the hype might bring this stock into overweight territory and oil will eventually stabilize.  That's the whole ""sell high"" part of the equation.  It's tough to see a situation where I'm still holding this stock six or nine months from now, but it's gonna be a great ride into the summer, and I think the value of holding NAT outweighs playing it with options.  I'm also gonna play some options on it too, because WTH.

&#x200B;

Yeah, some of the first few NAT leases are trash, but the beauty is that they're short term.  Some of the later contracts are straight $$$$$$$$.  DHT is locked into $67,300/day for 12-18 friggin months.  NAT, OTOH, says ""\[w\]e have concluded contracts of longer¬†duration than above,"" above being 60 days, to capture price increases using shorter contracts.  Since they were smart enough (smarter than DHT) to stop signing long-term contracts, hopefully they'll see when prices start to plateau and switch to signing long-term.  This was in March.  When oil prices still suck in mid-May (i.e. 60 days), DHT is going to be entering into new contracts. In March, even before oil got absolutely shitfucked to oblivion, they had deals on tanker time leases as high as $110,000/day.

Feel like I'll come out the other side of this way more extroverted and active. It makes me wonder if it will be a real, measurable sociological effect of this pandemic. We've all really become fucking reclusive with our phones and internet and shit, but I feel like people are now being forced to see that it's all pretty shallow and boring. It's like that thing where you get caught smoking cigarettes, and your abusive father makes you sit and smoke a whole pack in one sitting to make you realize that they actually suck.

Check out reputable sources and ideas - the reason why the etfs are still holding on due to the huge retail inflows into the funds because retail do not understand how the futures roll over works. Most of these funds have to do a rollover at the end of May as their contracts June expiration, next week or two a lot of the funds will lose shit loads of value unless daddy trump arranges something. Contango is steep and at -60%. Now oil is like vix post crisis. Institutional keep shorting front end up until the demand raises. If you think that demand will magnificently rise - you are wrong look at today‚Äôs prices. Whoever needed it got crude today and got paid for it, most of the traders are holding oil on and do not buy. I doubt situarion would change in a month. In any ways thanks to all the call holders and uso lingers who are happily pumping the price and letting smart people to get on short side."

On the contrary, cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively experience a relative increase in manufacturing employment, manufacturing output, and bank assets in 1919, after the end of the pandemic. The effects are economically sizable. Reacting 10 days earlier to the arrival of the pandemic in a given city increases manufacturing employment by around 5% in the post period. Likewise, a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of NPIs increases manufacturing employment by 6.5% after the pandemic. The patterns we identify in the data suggest that timely and aggressive NPIs can limit the most disruptive economic effects.

2020-04-20 20:43:53,scopolamine,7,"I think everybody is asking the question that what impact OIL will have on SP500 stocks.

Good part is that IMF already published [a paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2020/01/31/The-Future-of-Oil-and-Fiscal-Sustainability-in-the-GCC-Region-48934) on this topic.

The price of oil has a very limited impact on stock market prices; it does suggest, however, that analysts cannot really predict the way stocks react to changing oil prices. Correlation ‚â† Causation

Oil prices are determined by the supply and demand for petroleum-based products. During an economic expansion, prices might rise as a result of increased consumption; they might also fall as a result of increased production.

Price factors in the economy‚Äîsuch as wages, interest rates, industrial metals, plastic, and computer technology‚Äîcan offset changes in energy costs.

Another possibility is that corporations have become increasingly sophisticated at reading futures markets and are better able to anticipate shifts in factor prices; a firm should be able to switch production processes to compensate for added fuel costs. Some economists suggest that general stock prices often rise on the expectation of an increase in the quantity of money, which occurs independently of oil prices.

In other words, the economy is too complex to expect one commodity to drive all business activity in a predictable way. So don't expect markets to fall based on OIL."

I think we're going to see the market remain relatively flat for the week unless earnings are absolute shit - Netflix being the big bellwether.  


The market has clearly priced in expectations around government intervention - on a day where oil has an unprecedented collapse like today, it should have been a red circuit-breaker kind of day. Instead, we got \~1-2% down depending on which index you're following. If we get some more red days ahead and it starts to sink in that there's nothing the Fed can do to replace real jobs, services, and the production of goods the bottom is going to fall out.   


Play both sides and take profits when you can."

TGT I'm convinced is headed up soon and will break through its previous recent high, just a matter of whether it's tomorrow or a week.

I lost about 15% today though so feelsbad."
