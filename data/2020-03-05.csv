We're not gonna get those tests in time, once we hit the 62k ventilators or whatever mechanical breathing shit (I understand that less than I understand what I""m about to say) which is at 1.2 million infections then the death rate is gonna soar from 1% to 5% but more importantly ppl r gonna be all over social media posting about how their loved one was left to die in a hospital hallway because they were out of respirators. that person prolly laughing about corona rn. anyways how many days til we get there, i did a calculation and it's deifnintely wrong help me out pls

9 people dead 2 days ago at 1% death = 900 cases at 2 days ago, 150 confirmed cases

750 walking around let's say. I know people are self quarantining but how do u account for the ones that actually are right that they have it

it doubles every 3 days

2\^12 \* 750 = 1.4 million which for those of u that can't follow means 12 \* 3/2 (coz it takes 3 days to double) = 18 days as of 2 days ago (18 - 2) = 16 days until we hit that moment were someone is on social media dying in a hallway

&#x200B;

If we can figure out the exact fucking day that unfortunate soul both dies and gets posted into instagram live doing so we will fucking prinnnnnt. I actually don't know what to do on that day I""m just assuming the general population will actually start paying attention. And probably panic. Maybe not though recent news has convinced me the general populatin is even dumber than i am

&#x200B;

Oh yeah if u wanna have fun with this u can bump the number and assume 9 people dead 2 days ago means that 900 were infected 16 days ago or whatever (2 weeks + 2 days assuming they were sick for 2 weeks before dying).  That means we're there already which is definitely not the case. Most of my healthcare professional friends are not concerned at all about this shit at all they're not gonna panic until they see that they're a day away from running out of respirators. Who knows though they're fucking stupider than I am maybe they won't realize they're out until they're actually out. But hypothetically it could dawn on one of them then they're gonna blast social media and no one will pay attention except for degenerates like us. I'm gonna follow every healthcare professional i can on twitter that is telling everyone corona isn't a big deal. Fuck all this math once they say to panic I""m going all in"

Need to buy shorts at the end of an upswing day for 100-200% profit potential. That shit happened after both upswing days this week but only realized it now. DAX can't keep up with those 4% S&P gains and won't be able to close the gap if you buy last second DAX shorts seconds before NYSE close. So even if it opens in the green, your puts will break even or even make a small profit. If shit goes down, DAX opens red and S&P gets brutalized, +100-200% EOD."

1. US demands quarantines wherever community spread is present. People won't go to work if they can work at home. We can slow down the spread but our most poor will suffer. They will eventually get sick and try to keep going to work to pay rent. This will eventually overwhelm hospitals.

1. US lets people keep going to work. Schools don't close until kids get sick. The kids will spread it to the parents and people will end up staying at home sick around the same time. This will exacerbate the hospitals but you'll get over the spread faster. Low income still suffers unless there's a government paid time-off.

Literally just asking if I'm right, not trying to explain

when people trust stonks less and less, they go for more secure investments like treasury bonds even though they have a lower rate of return. 

When more people want to buy the treasury bonds, the yield rates go down as the prices of the bonds go up, so the yield falling essentially represents investors having less and less confidence."

From the recent peak in Oct '18 until today, it has dropped about 72%. About 480 days, dropping from about 3.25% to 0.89%.

We haven't even really crashed yet though and the 10 year has dropped this much. By the time yields hit 2% back in Dec '08, the market had already fallen like 50% with the total drop being about 57%.

If SPY shoots up above 315 and starts finding support we may be out of the mud, but I would expect it to stick close to the moving average for a while. I would guess that the more we dip our toes below 299, the more likely it is we slip and fall in. Regardless, these 2.5-4% swings a few times a week are likely going to continue into next week at the very least. Expect both 315 and 300 to continue to be tested."

And his calls were gleaming in silver and gold;
And the green of their gains was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their tendies at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay wither'd and strown.

For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
And coughed in the face of the foe as he pass'd;
And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!

And there lay the Bull with his nostril all wide,
But through it blowed not the coke of his pride:
And the tears of his crying lay clear on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

And there lay the Bear distorted and pale,
With the nachos on his neck and their dust on his mail;
And the shitposters were all silent, the hookers alone,
The comments unposted, the penis unblown.

And the widows of Wall Street are loud in their wail,
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Normie, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord"

We always warn dumbasses here about selling naked options at risk of a rogue wave.  You're naive if you don't think some of the big boys haven't taken on excessive risk in some securities as well for easy money.  Could explain the emergency rate cute on Tuesday morning: they caught wind that someone made some shit investments and was at risk so bailout.

They're closing their regional HQ here and making everyone work from home for the next 2 weeks, and asking that all internal travel to Dallas be rescheduled. Looks like they might know something not yet reported in the media. My balls tell me that one of their infected employees from home office in Redmond travelled here and they're trying to mitigate rn. 

MSFT calls already wiped me out, so I need all of my üåàüêª brothers to stock up on puts and fight the good fight. Hopefully I can join you if my very last SIX and AAL puts print in the next few weeks. Also might just sell those and go in on puts on $MSFT"
