2020-08-13 08:29:50,haasvacado,12,"There are two groups on which the velocity of the market currently depends on to a frightening degree.

The first is the US congress, which is terrifying and has so far met expectations of remarkable disfunction. Don‚Äôt kid yourself: JPow says it in every fucking speech that the ball is in their court. It is my opinion that second stimmy is not priced in and will not be priced in until the ink on a bill is dry. 

The second is vaccine companies. Although no coronavirus vaccine has ever been created, there has also never been such a concerted effort to create one. A vaccine, I believe, has already been priced in to the broader market (winning companies still going to pop the fuck off on FDA approval). 

If we assume that second stimmy has not been priced in and vaccine has, it seems reasonable to conclude that if the first vaccine to report on phase 3 trials is a failure, then watch the fuck out. Faith in science will be crushed and the vaccine will be priced out.

TDLR; faith in science is the underlying sentiment of this market. The first vaccine to report phase three trial results has more potential to crush the market than it does to raise it.


*Companies:*

The companies that are in phase 3 trials NOW as far as I understand it:

PFE and BiONTeCH are partnered 

AZN (and oxford university)

I don‚Äôt think Johnson & Johnson & Johnson & Johnson or Merck or Moderna have gotten their respective candidates to phase 3 yet."

Tesla's stock split could be seen as a move consistent with Musk's vision. By splitting the stock price, buying one share will be more affordable to retail investors who don't want fractional ownership of a share through a platform like Robinhood."

Once upon a time there was a bagholder and a frog. The bagholder needed to cross the river so he asked the frog for a ride on his back. 

The frog agreed to the bagholder‚Äôs request but said ‚Äúonly if you promise to sell those -80% calls as those bags are too heavy for me to carry across the river‚Äù.

The bagholder replied ‚ÄúWhy would I carry these worthless options with me? We would both drown.‚Äù

The frog agreed and told the bagholder to meet him at the river the next day.

The next day came and the bagholder and frog began their journey across the river. 

Halfway through, the bagholder opened his Robinhood and saw that his PRPL and SLV calls had fallen to -99%, dooming them both.

‚ÄúWhy would you not sell? Now we will both drown!‚Äù, cried the frog.

The bagholder replied ‚Äúit is in my nature‚Äù.

2020-08-13 04:33:30,YoshikageHands,-1,The retail appeal was that tsla moved $100 a day. While this is obviously creating a crazy rh pump pre split after the split nobody will get excited to see a $20 move on a stock. Combine this with the possibility of s&p rejection for questionable accounting practices to achieve profitability as well as reliance on government grants. TSLA may very well be a very cheap stock in two months.

Yesterday's dip and rip back was oddly funny. Don't know what to make of it. Monthly Puts is the way here. No stress for chasing big moves each day  for weeklies who expire faster.

Jumped in SLV with perfect timing, 2x my money in a day. Held overnight and it crashed to even. Traded sideways for a week, sold at a loss. Moon mission resumed next day.    


Got in APPL on the Friday after the stock split announcement with a 0dte. Thought I was going to strike gold. Held... held... not happening... sold for a loss five minutes before the moon mission started, and missed out on a 3233% gain that would have saved me.  


Today, back to TSLA 8/14 calls at open, expecting stock split to deliver an instant run up like I've seen several times before. This time, it stood pat as my money evaporated. Sold for a loss. Half hour later, moon mission, missed out on at least a 150% play.

Only way interest rates rise is if the fed is forced to through inflation. Otherwise it‚Äôs hard to imagine a prolonged downturn. Maybe stay flat or in a range but hard to justify a large contraction when fed can continue to print/stimulate with no ramifications.

With that fixed now, rather than *$5 roundtrip* for the micro indices I am paying <$1.  And it‚Äôs about $1.50 for the minis.  You have to pay for futures market data but they waive it if you spend $20/mo or more in commissions.

Just thought I‚Äôd shill the shit outta a different broker than TDA for a change because their futures commissions are the highest I‚Äôve seen; $5/play really eats into profits from scalping the micros.

It had that underdog never bet against america vibe and everyone loves a little bit of american exceptionalism. But reaching ATH, that will have the opposite effect. We dont have a goal post anymore, no target to strive for, we'll be forced to evaluate where we actually stand. When we reach that peak of ATH on the SPY it will be sobering. The whole world that was previously on board with the American equity as safe haven and America leading the recovery from economic havoc will now have to stand back for a moment and consider if we actually earned this recovery.

 When people and by extension markets are in a goal seeking mindset it is much different than when the goal is achieved and we switch to a contemplative mindset as we decide where to go next. I dont think we will decide that the market deserves to chart new all time highs regardless of the level of fed stimulus and dollar liquidity."

What would be hit hardest by a lack of stimulus? Obvious air travel would crater, LMT will lose share if Republicans don't tuck something in the bill for them, low end consumer luxury products (name brands that poor people like, such as Nike), maybe cars (even though the last stimulus didn't give them the traditional boost), and probably credit cards as more people simply put their cards into hardship and don't pay. 

What else do you guys think would be hurt? And what would be helped? Any publicly traded repo companies? 

Does rioting help or hurt insurance companies? It probably encourages buying insurance but do they pay out on riot damage? I know a lot of contracts I've worked on (non-insurance) are excused in cases of riot, civil insurrection, and so on."

NEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/          --¬†Pornhub, the premier online destination for adult entertainment,          announced the launch of its ""Orgasm Gap"" campaign in honor of          International Female Orgasm Day, an initiative geared toward closing          the orgasm gap in heterosexual relationships. As part of the campaign,          on August 8th, Pornhub interrupted videos          most popular with straight men at the 40% timestamp to highlight the          percentage of women in heterosexual relationships who do not reach          orgasm during sex. Additionally, to motivate straight men to take care          of unfinished business, Pornhub invited women to visit the campaign's          landing page to reward the men who successfully made them climax with          an official orgasm giver certification.

2020-08-12 23:50:26,plasticblock4dayz,3,"New strategy I started this week:

Step 1. Buy bank stocks (BAC, PNC, JPM, BK). 

Step 2: Buy OTM LEAPs at furthest expiration available with breakevens between 10-20% from current price. 

Step 3: Sell calls diagonally to buy more of the specific bank stock. 

Step 4: When dividend arrives, buy more LEAPS. Repeat step 3. 

Since it‚Äôs not 2022 yet, upon expiration of the LEAPs (assuming they‚Äôre ITM by then), I plan to use 25%-30% of the proceeds for more LEAPS, 25-30% back into the stock to generate more dividends, 40%-50% to fund the purchases of stocks/options unrelated to bank stocks. In the scenario that the calls are not ITM within 2-3 months to expiration, I‚Äôll probably sell then use the remaining proceeds to assist in the purchase of more LEAPs when the dividend arrives. 

Feel free to critique this or provide any input. Obviously I need to wait until 2022 to see how if it actually worked."

Sector rotation involves using the proceeds from the sale of securities related to a particular investment sector for the purchase of securities in another sector. This strategy is used as a way to capture returns from market cycles and to diversify holdings over a specified holding period.

tldr - Tech moons, retail etc buys in. Fire sale in other sectors. Cash out, buy there for pennies. Retail other institutions rotate following the hype, hold bags. After enough GAINZ. The music stops. Sector rotation.

My question to you is how does this work in bubble market flow. If people keep piling post-weak-ass-rotation into the sector that was rotated out. MMs are forced to rotate back at a loss. True?"

Threw my life savings on selling NIO puts for earnings.

Intentionally diamond handed by going camping By Mt. Baker with no signal.

Drove back home today after market close  and saw $966 profit of my max 2K.

Saw the price history and saw I would have probably pussied out at -1.8K at open. Feels good man probably gonna let theta decay the whole thing for max profit since the highest risk time period is over.


Edit I had to put up 33k in cash as collateral to sell those contracts to clarify.

-Old man at desk was super nice

-One store did not carry purple in stock because they said they carry more expensive items and purple was considered mid level.

-The same store said they sold purple mattress despite having any in store because people came in already sold on it from word of mouth

-120 day return policy store wide but there have been no purple returns at 2 of the stores

-Purple sheets have been selling super well

-Once a month they place a restocking warehouse order, this was done already this month and it was bigger than expected‚Äî typically he said the bigger the restock order the  better they are selling

2020-08-12 20:11:15,Revolant742,18,"Even before the opening bell, ~~Monday~~ Thursday looked ugly.
But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.

Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined ~~Monday~~ Thursday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of ~~a bailout~~ Stimulus.
