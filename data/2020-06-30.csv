It used to be even better until 2016 ruined it. You could target ""Fans of Hanukah"" and sell them little hats if you wanted. Now you can't exclude based on religion or race, but there will always be ways. You can exclude fans of the NBA that are also fans of KFC.

I set up an ad audience for a personal injury lawyer in Brooklyn and he wanted to target broke ethnic minorities. We used their food choices and interest in social programs like SNAP, welfare, etc. I got a whole list from the NY website and threw every program into the mix, and set it to match with people who enjoy okra and collard greens. Threw this on top of some geo constraints and were able to target some ads to the exact clientele he wanted."

#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 


#____________________


Asian markets have bounced of their major support and have are testing their intermediate resistance


**India** up 1.25% 

**Hangseng** up 0.5% (closed today)

**Nikkei** down 0.75%


#_____________________



Europe indices are somewhat respecting their yesterdays tally and are holding on to their gains

**Dax** up 0.66% 


**CAC40** down 0.16%


**FTSE** down 0.023%


#_____________________


**Dow** (25,644.0) -45.0 (-0.18%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in the range determination in the previous week, but an exciting observation is that some global market have breached their intermediate resistance

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

We were going long at the very moment spy Was at 300 and we got lucky that 295 stop loss dint get hit, something to worry about today is that we are trading in a range and are at the upper end of it, we are still bullish but recommend to shift stop losses to 305 from 300


Major support is still 295 and 300 and resistance is at 314 and 320,


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 309 - 314 with an expectation that 308 becomes a short term support


Highly recommend to the people talking longs today to have you stops at 305, as breaking 305 would invite 300 again

#____________________


**Longterm** : for long term investing we keep an eye on Nasdaq charts and were skeptical when Nasdaq was below its 10k psychological support, but sirprisingly that support is reclaimed, the sentiment on long charts is flat to bullish thus create an accumulation zone in sip mode for long term stock holding


#______________________

Even after the support of 300 being respected, we are relatively flat for past month, highly recommend to book profits on upper end of ranges, or at least pushing your Stop losses if riding all the way





#____________________


Random tip for the day : ""stock market is not a mirror of current scenario but rather a forecaster of future, when you take position, you are trying to predict the future, so don't tell it what to do rather see what it's doing ""

But more interestingly, conformal cyclic cosmology theorizes that as the universe ages many many trillions of years into the far future, the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate so much that individual atoms and eventually subatomic particles decay into energy (photons). When all the matter is ripped apart, the laws of special relativity come into play. As something approaches the speed of light it drastically slows down time from the perspective of the observer and since all photons are moving at the speed of light, they do not experience time and there is no distance between them and any anything else. If the entire universe decayed into photons you now have all of the energy of the universe in one point with no distance in between anything. Boom, a big bang.

there was never supposed to be this much QE. virus was worse than expected. rally was more than anyone expected. June 8 Fed balance sheet stabilizes. takes foot off the gas. we downtrend.

Q2. good quarter. best since 1987 in fact. supposed to rebalance into bonds. but yields are so low. Fed is propping them up but big boys won't touch it. they rebalance right back into equities. stimulus coming.

kept trying to figure it out like ppl knew what to do. but something was still off. couldn't see it. had that last assumption in the way. but if I let go of it then it all starts to make more sense.

2020-07-01 05:28:46,SixOneFive615,10,"It's Priced In, Stupid: History Lesson from the Challenger Disaster

All kinds of people, mainly gay bears, as asking ""is xxxx priced in?"". Think ""second wave"" or ""mortgage defaults"" or ""20 million unemployed"". The answer to all of this is: Yes. Emphatically yes.

Now, since WSB is mainly made up of 17 year old flipping options between 5th and 6th Period Zoom classes, I'd like to share a quick story with you about The Challenger Space-shuttle disaster. January 1986 TL;DR it was nationally hyped, with a teacher aboard, and everyone watched it explode in the sky, killing everyone aboard. It was 9/11 before 9/11.

So the stock market was open at that time, and there were 4 major companies associated with the production of the rocket. Here's what happened within 20 minutes of the explosion: Martin Marietta (-3%), Lockheed (-5%), Rockwell (-6%), and Martin Thiokol (-7%, circuit breaker). However, by the end of the day, the first three had gained most of the loss back, and Morton Thiokol was down 12%.

President Reagan appointed a panel to figure out what happened, and after MONTHS of investigations and hundreds of reports, they came to the conclusion that it was the O-Rings produced by Morton Thiokol. Something the market was pretty sure of within 20 mins and positive about within a day.

And this is 30 years ago before computers and investment algorithms had been developed. No one investor knew for sure, but bringing asymmetrical information together in the market gave us a pretty good idea.

So, with the coronavirus, yes, it's priced in."

Get sick while uninsured. Get billed for something expensive (not like some routine $200 shit, just pay that outta pocket you broke fuck.) When you get the bill, call collections, tell them you can't afford the bill. They'll set you up with a payment plan, when they ask how much, tell them you can only afford $10 a month (don't laugh.) 

They'll let you pay $10 a month and as long as you do you're not delinquent on your credit. In 2 years roughly your debt will have been sold to twenty different collection agencies for less and less than you initially owed and you'll be able to settle for as little as 25% of the original bill. 

So recap, you paid $10 a month for 24 months ($240) against a $5000 bill, which you were able to settle for $1250 for a total out of pocket of $1490. 

Compare this to paying premiums for 24 months with an average premium of $200 a month for a 20-something ($4800.)"

Why this works is because you have to groups right now, price sensitive people who have mostly fled and millions of WSB'rs who love buying high. The algos would take the price to 10k spy if they could just to sell to RH'rs who love buying high.

Tencent recently sued some hot sauce company for missing ad payments of 10M rmb, but the company showed clear evidence that they were never in an ad deal with tencent whatsoever. Upon further investigation they figured out that when tencent initially tried to reach the hot sauce company for the ad deal, one of tencents employee had used BIDU to search up the said hot sauce company but accidentally got into a phasing scam. Therefore the ""deal"" they made was actually with the scammers. Now tencent is switching their lawsuit against BIDU."

The trade official, when making the matter clear, said PHASE 1 is remaining in place, implying the rest of the deal is dead. PHASE 1 was a very small portion of the overall talks.

>  
>The rally hasn’t been driven by bullish buyers, but rather by short sellers, who borrowed and sold stocks months ago to bet that prices would decline, and are now buying the shares back to close out their existing short positions. The act is known as short covering .  
>  
>In general, equity fund flows move in the same direction as market performance, meaning the more assets in equity funds, the higher stock prices. Since 2002, over 40% of annual global equity market performance can be explained by flows, noted Manthey. Only three out of the past 18 years saw the market rally despite equity outflows—in 2012, 2016 and 2019.

2020-06-30 20:33:12,frzgg,6,"At EOD, bought TSLA $1065p 7/10.  So far web traffic is 7 for 7 as an indicator for demand changes which helped me significantly on Chewy and Chegg.  

According to most web traffic ranking sites, from 4/1 to 6/30, traffic has reduced 31% over this time frame.  A lot of reports on the slow down in VIN registrations over the same time frame helps reinforce this.  Retail physical locations closed down in 2019 so all orders are web based.   
Couple this with the supply side with many of their factories shut down for a significant period of time, I think this noise the last 48 hours on 'beating' are off base.  

Been wrong before and 50% chance I'm wrong again, but based on all of these signals, hard for me to see a beat here on delivery day (tomorrow or Thursday)."
