I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner.

#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets after having a dong rally for past few days refuses to give up gains but have halted their rally today


**India** up 0.18% 

**Hangseng**  down 1.38% 

**Nikkei** down 0.44%


#_____________________



Europe had a much more extended rally than Asia thus they are facing a bit selling pressure in the early trade

**Dax** down1.24% 


**CAC40** down 1.07%


**FTSE** down 1.27%


#_____________________


**Dow futures (25,894.0) -285.0(-1.09%)**

#____________________

Global markets, even tho some indices are a bit down are still in a bullish trend, to summarize, the earlier resistance has become support

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Spy is currently on a buy on dips sentiment, we consider this the most profitable phase of any charts as trading this becomes easy

**Weekly major support is 307 and 310 and resistance at 314 and 320**

Today we are actually not taking any trades as we would like to see how the market reacts to 314, we still need convincing of the 314 support strength, as the action here will decide whether the spy will go ahead to test 320 or will again find balance at 307

#Personal bias is that today we will trade in a narrow range of 310 and 316 much rather a consolidation day

Would not recommend going long here as risk reward is not favourable 


#____________________


**Longterm** : it is same as before, it is very difficult to be bearish in long term view when NASDAQ itself is making new highs, we believe that Nasdaq 10k support has become as strong as spy 300 support, thus we are strongly bullish on long term, but we request you to add long term stocks in SIP mode to benefit the current volitality

#____________________

If we see from an overview, today feels like no bull or bear position is showing clarity and spy seems to have found a range to rest on for short term, usually we don't trade derivatives position when we feel there is no significant move in the either side thus we will use this period to add some stocks 




#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : ""wisdom is knowing the you don't know anything""



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market¬†(314.40) ‚àí2.65¬†(0.84%)**

\- In repo markets, if repo rates spike like the last year, then you can expect a rug pull. Same with treasury yields.

\- In credit markets, if delinquency rate spike high or CLOs getting downgraded in a fast fashion or bankruptcies going higher, then you can expect a rug pull.

\- In bond markets, if corporate bonds are getting downgraded a lot, then you can expect a rug pull.

Days like these are just a correction."

1 has $500 in savings.  
2 has $20,000 in savings.  
3 has $5,000,000 in savings.  
They're all given $1,500 stimulus check. What does each person do with their check and what is the impact of that?  
  
2 and 3 probably invest. Causing inflated asset prices. Leading to a larger wealth inequality.  
1 saves what they can and spends what's needed. Ultimately deflated.

Welcome to the magical world of turbo-trading

**#What do you need?**

A reputable broker that allows for trading turbo's

**#What is a turbo?**

A financial product similar to a CFD, where the bank finances a a part of the share, but 100% of the gains are for you. E.g. they can finance $1200 of a TSLA share, you pay the rest, but if the share goes up $1, your turbo goes up $1 as well. In percentages, this is a better way of trading than just having 1 share

**#What's the upside?**

For the same amount 1 share costs, you can have 10 times the return or more

**#What's the downside?**

There's a fixed stoploss and a financing agreement. The financing is, however, pretty low, a couple of cents if you would hold a couple of days

You're welcome"

Sometimes I like to get those fake dollar bills with Jesus inscriptions on them and go to busy restaurants and when the server is overwhelmed and hasn't cleaned a table that just left ill sneak over and drop like 5 of them down and sneak them under the plate or pile of napkins.

Sometimes I fart on the subway and just start laughing.

Sometimes i soak lighters in Vaseline and drop them around bars.

Sometimes I also soak non watered down matches in gasoline and do the same.

Sometimes in the middle of a conversation I'll just start laughing even if something isn't funny.

Sometimes when someone tells me something that they think is interesting ill say ""thats cool but did you hear that.."" and repeat exactly what they said to me back to them.

Sometimes ill send buzzfeed articles to people on Facebook whom I've only met once but I know they're polite enough not to tell me to fuck off.

Sometimes ill compare very mundane and minor problematic situations to nazi Germany.

Sometimes I tell people I'm 1/1000th Cherokee.

holy shit im almost slightly starting to feel bad for the guy not really though because hes a billionaire

he needs to get the fuck off twitter lmao he probably gets bitched at by thousands of retards every day"
2020-07-07 04:48:44,pilotsepisode,10,"Yeah... it‚Äôs pretty bad. I live with my uncle still after my family died when I was pretty young. He‚Äôs a good person and I am glad he was nice enough to take me in at an early age. I have no other extended family so I would be in foster care otherwise. But despite him being a good person I think there may be something wrong with him. He doesn‚Äôt talk to me at all sometimes we share three words a day. He keeps to himself mostly sticking to his ‚Äúwork‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really know what he does but he‚Äôs always doing something. All of this is relatively normal for a middle aged man, but when he gets home he is often very sweaty and covered in dirt. I figured he worked construction but he never really told me what he did he just says he works and gets pressed if I keep asking. Anyways, he will go in the backyard with a shovel and descend into what I assume to be at least a 20 foot hole at this point. He ‚Äúdigs‚Äù as he calls it. The hole is so deep now that he literally disappears into the hole and it‚Äôs really deep. He does this every night. I don‚Äôt see him much at all. I assume he does this through the night as well because sometimes I do not hear him return to the house. 

Another thing that sets me off is his ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù he has books such as ‚ÄúTruth of the Underground‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuried Secrets‚Äù ‚ÄúLost Lineage: The Anatomy of Giants‚Äù 

All of these books talk about, I guess, giants who used to live underground? I‚Äôm not really sure as I haven‚Äôt read them only skipped through pages, but what I did read was pretty jarring. One of the books claims humans used to live underground and be 12 feet tall, due to the increased gravity. The books say being underground is where humans should reside, as sun gives us cancer and the earth used to be much closer to the core. It also says being underground advances your intellect.

I have not asked him about anything as I‚Äôm scared he might react in a crazy way. Am I overreacting or does this sound weird to anyone?"

1.   Make money in a completely boring way that does not actually present significant room for growth and is vulnerable to competition.

Google (ads), Amazon (remote computing), Facebook (ads), square (small restaurant/retail payments),  Snapchat (ads), Tesla (cars)

2.  Dazzle the public with words they can't understand. Sell them the dream of unprofitable, unproven, and short lived moonshots that fail quietly once the buzz is over.

Glass, glasses, fiber, deepmind, project tango, deep learning, automated stores, autonomous driving, vr, ar, Oculus.

3.  Continue to only make money on profit sources that have been available for decades. Create no lasting new profit sources. Convince the public profit doesn't matter. While your market cap grows exponentially compared to realistic, traditional, profitable, and sane companies.

Profit. Or actually don't, but profit off your stock price."

I actually work for Toyota so I am biased, but the majority of Toyota's revenues come from finance/insurance/ service.  You buy a Toyo, finance it through Toyo financial, buy a Toyo warranty and then take it through service.  TSLA doesn't have anything even close to approaching these profit streams (except some hypothetical subscription services in the future).    Toyota also have the best selling hybrid of all time, and the ability to make full EV,  which there are already several in their lineup.

Even taking total production numbers, TSLA's quarterly output isn't even ONE HOUR, of the automakers combined, and they are supposedly worth more based on the future of self-driving technology that nobody asked for?  A pie in the sky idea, where Google and Uber are front-running the technology?  A company  whose only profits come from selling EV credits because the other manufacturers don't/didn't see EV as profitable?  Sorry the Model 3 isn't replacing the Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla anytime in the next decade or two.

40% market cap increase based on matching their last years numbers?  In a luxury segment that's least affected by Covid?   TSLA IS A FUCKING CAR COMPANY no matter what you think, and that's why their market cap has bloated off of mediocre at best delivery numbers.

""""It's continuous at this point. Not even joking. There was so much doubt in Tesla, the options sell in increments of 5-10-20 dollars, every time it reached over the strike, it forced the writers to buy 100 shares to cover(if they haven't). There are a couple hundred thousand options that are under $1430, that means millions and millions of shares will have to be covered/traded tomorrow or by friday before it expires worthless.

The 1500 strikes have about 23,000 contracts traded. If it gets close to $1500, that means 2.3 million shares will have to cover/trade before Friday. And that's only 1 option.

There are writers from 1440-1460-1480.

Let's see, Chinese so government pump, electric car for meme and TSLA fomo, and finally in the past when it has built a head of steam like it has recently, it tends to make truly disgusting moves. Ran to $7+ from a similar starting point in 2017 and 2019. I believe these are short squeezes since some huge amount is always short.

It's immune to deflation, easier to transfer, less fees. People who missed the ride were still able to eek out that last 100-300% gain, and everybody felt like a genius. It just kept going up, the reasoning being that this *is* the future.

When you see 90K deliveries for TSLA, the same amount as last year, but with a 7X valuation since then, this is what it looks like. How many cars do they need to sell to be as profitable as Toyota (who by the way has humongous finance, insurance and service arms). What makes them think that Toyota, Honda and other manufacturers won't jump into the EV game (after all the Prius, 8 years senior to the model 3 is the most successful hybrid of all time). Why is W, an unprofitable app that has taken the escalator from 8th in the App Store to almost out of the top 100, double it's valuation since then? It's all non-sensical no matter where you look in tech.

It's identical to how ""Mannacoin,"" and ""cyscoin,"" who did absolutely nothing in the digital coin space were able to gain multibillion dollar valuations. Hype. And when it comes down, it won't be a slow bleed, it will come crashing.

2) Elon continually pumping the stock on Twitter
3) Ridiculous call option volume forcing MMs to gamma hedge and continually buy stock
4) Elon burning so many short sellers and scaring them away, market cap getting so high that even if someone wanted to make a big bet and short $TSLA it would take billions of capital and once publicly disclosed that individual would get blasted on Twitter by Elon and all $TSLA fanboys, bunch would even just buy the stock to spite the short seller... so no one wants to even attempt it because others have tried and lost.

I think playing NIO in the direction TSLA moves might be a good idea for those who don't want to pay exorbitant premiums but still want the n-bagging (where n > 1) experience. There looks to be a brief period prior to this run-up where they were less correlated than normal, so I'm trying to further understand why that is, as well as see if there's a way to determine if there's any lag (i.e. TSLA moves up first, NIO follows suit) that I can quantify for a good entry point.

2020-07-06 23:47:19,BlueKnightJoe,11,"The trillion dollar question. Why are COVID cases increasing while deaths are decreasing? The answer is simple. It's called Simpson's paradox and it's the result of incorrectly pooling data and arriving at a false conclusion.

If you lump the data and look at the U.S. as a whole, you'll see: cases increasing, positivity rates increasing, hospitalization rates increasing, but deaths decreasing. It would be rational to come to the following conclusions: ""Young people are getting it now, not old people."" ""We've gotten better at treating it."" ""We're testing more people, so we're seeing more cases."" There's some truth to these conclusions, but the three combined can't fully explain the numbers we're seeing in several new hotspots.

Here's the truth. At this point, Covid-19 is not one but MANY outbreaks spread unevenly. We need to be looking at state and not national data. If you zoom in on Texas or Arizona individually, the data looks really bad. And if you zoom in further to look at just Houston or just Miami, it's even worse.

The truth is simple, and horrifying. We are about to have dozens of NYCs around the country. The next 8 weeks are going to be brutal, no matter what we do. ICUs overflowing, ventilators rationed, tens of thousands of deaths.

I hope I'm wrong. Stay safe."

The issue is two-fold. I've been staying with my parents until my lease in this city starts next month, and my little brother who lives here has a bad immune system issue. So I have to fly out of here tomorrow.

I was scheduled to fly Saturday to move out of my old place and relocate back here. I have pushed this off forever and this is my absolute last chance. However, I won't know whether or not I'm COVID positive or not. I absolutely have to leave for my brother's sake. But I feel like it is a moral hazard to get on an airplane when I could be exposing everyone on-board.

What's the best course of action here?

2020-07-06 23:14:26,FourOranges,17,"Writing this while holding back tears, here goes...

I'm an average Joe and I managed to build an investment portfolio of 80k in the last 5 years. I learned to invest from reading and practicing and I started out slowly, made my mistakes and learned along the way.

I turned 20k into 80k in the last 4 years using a few different strategies. I bought smartly, and short sold when something was too high. I've been careful and smart about it and everything went well until two days ago...

When a stock I follow increased by 75% from where I originally held it (TSLA), I sold all my shares and started shorting it little by little as it went up. What I didn't know, and I don't think anyone else did either, is the the stock would go on to essentially quadruple. My total loss was 99%. The bigger mistake was that in shorting, I got carried away and kept shorting more as it went up. Eventually I had the value of 100% of my portfolio in that trade, and when all hell broke loose (the stock rallied +40% the past week) , I started getting margin calls and eventually had positions forcefully closed when I couldn't fund the account.

I know I made a mistake by over leveraging myself to increase the position, but it was also a once in a decade 'pop' that this multi billion dollar company did in a matter of days. The fact that a multi billion dollar can become seen as worth 4 times as much in a period of a month is something for another discussion but also taught me the markets are absolutely Irrational. Completely Irrational at times.

Needless to say I'm heart broken and going through 'some things'. I make a slightly above average salary, and I worked hard to save up and put time and effort into increasing that portfolio over the years.

I'm at a point now where I don't know what to do. I'm in my 30's, and had been hoping to increase that portfolio a little more so I could buy a home and start a family with my wife. I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me and I'm ashamed of my mistake and fighting feelings of hopelessness and depression. My wife is loving and supportive and isn't holding anything against me. She knows what happened was an unlikely outcome and was not intentional. It kills me soul to remember the look in her eyes when I told her though... God...

I've been knocked on my butt a few times before in life whether with career, relationships, or even money, and I've always managed to learn and get back on my feet. Today I just feel old and tired. I had so many hopes and dreams and was finally getting close to them, and now I have to start all over.

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you handle losing everything and starting over? Was I just too early and sold calls too soon? I'm thinking about buying TSLA puts after I get this all sorted out..."

2020-07-06 23:00:57,BaalBoys,-5,"The argument for Northern Ireland being part of the U.K. is that a majority of people in Northern Ireland (at least until very recently) have wanted it to be part of the U.K. The Ulster Scots have been there for so long that ignoring their wishes and telling them to go back to where they came from could be classified as ethnic cleansing. Modern Irish nationalism tends to make the argument that both traditions are equally Irish ‚Äîso Ulster Scots can and should feel included in a united Ireland that‚Äôs no longer just celebrating Gaelic heritage. As the country of Ireland makes no claim to Northern Ireland and the Belfast Agreement was agreed by both sides, there‚Äôs no urgent claim for Northern Ireland being reunited with Ireland. There‚Äôs also the fair argument that before the nation state was invented in the 19th century, land was trading hands in Europe frequently. If Britain and Ireland weren‚Äôt islands the line in the sand would be less clear and distinct.

However, on the other side there are a few points. One may be that the United Kingdom was always doomed to break up because the identities of each country are so strong. The polarization between Westminster and Scotland and NI is so wide now that there‚Äôs arguably no coming back from it. There‚Äôs also the argument that Northern Ireland would probably do better long term if the country overseeing it didn‚Äôt just treat it as an after thought. Belfast would be the second largest city in a United Ireland and therefore of much more concern to a government of 8 million people rather than 65 million people. There is strong evidence that Northern Ireland‚Äôs economy has been irreparably damaged by cheap subsidization from London. It has gone from producing 80% of the island‚Äôs traded goods at independence to producing as much exports as a single Dublin suburb in 2018. There‚Äôs also the argument that Northern Ireland‚Äôs political structure is not representative. While unionists tend to be much more conservative than Republicans, they‚Äôre nowhere near as conservative as the DUP base that‚Äôs supposed to be representing them. Civic engagement with democracy is strong in the Republic and weak in the UK and NI right now so young unionists may feel better represented in the liberal republic than the conservative North. Add to that the founding problems with NI such as the way the border was drawn to silence the minority, to the fairly reasonable argument that what Britain did there to plant its own people in the 16th century would now contravene international law and you‚Äôll find that there is a strong argument for a United Ireland. Especially considering the trouble it will cause the U.K. government as they choose to diverge radically from Ireland‚Äôs internationalist pro EU positions. 

But whatever I or you think, it all comes down to a border poll. The people of Northern Ireland get to decide. The U.K. is still a democracy. What I can tell you is that culturally Unionist people in NI are getting old and their population is falling, while culturally Nationalist people in NI are young and their population is growing. It does seem only like a matter of time before a big change happens."

I have committed crimes of determining price action by fundamentals.

I have read candlesticks in early futures.


For these, and my other crimes, I have purchased the following.


J&J 145c 7-17 40X

MSFT 220c 7-17 40X

AAPL 400c 7-17 30X

There are all kinds of nuances to determining future cash flows, net present values, etc. Some of those nuances have to be based on assumptions, and usually comparables (similar companies) are used to get a general idea of growth/revenue/expenses over time.

TSLA boils down to this: are we comparing it to car companies or tech companies? 
If the answer is ‚Äúcar‚Äù, then yes, it‚Äôs completely overvalued. Just selling cars isn‚Äôt going to justify the current price. Ever.
If the answer is ‚Äútech‚Äù, then no, it‚Äôs not overvalued. This is assuming TSLA will lead the way in autonomous driving, and have a hand in almost everything ‚Äútransportation‚Äù in the future."

Make sure you get paid up. Surely Trump and Wall Street wouldn't stiff people who weren't paid up front.

In relative terms, I am going to double all my positions once the market pulls back versus trading down to my core positions to raise cash.

This is a shoot the lights out scenario into year-end.  I mentioned before that the dip will be shallow but I am starting to change my mind.  I think we might have a bigger dip but we recover quickly.  

Let's see how tomorrow develops.  There is no question this market looks like it is ignoring everything and just melting up.  No place for people to put money has to be a big factor."

> After exiting natural gas storage and transmission, Dominion Energy is likely to focus its growth strategy on offshore wind power. Individual investors will find new obstacles and opportunities in the next-generation renewable energy source, but the business is at least geographically positioned to succeed.

The most important thing about a blowoff top is that you don't want to try to trade against it; we could go up another 20-30% across the board with some stocks like TSLA having another 50+% upside in a blowoff top scenario.

It's hard to sustain short-term puts against that.  You're better off just going cash if you're skeptical of this uptrend and wait for the market to start going down."

People think it‚Äôs some boutique car company that has no substance but people are buying Tesla‚Äôs left and right especially liberal 40-60 yr olds. Millennials with money are also picking them up and that will only increase as their supply chain and factory situation improves which will allow them to make cars for even cheaper than now. The auto industry is one of the hardest to break into, as evidenced by the same 5 companies ruling it for the last 40 years, Tesla has done a great job breaking into the market with their brand recognition and solid cars. They‚Äôre super fun to drive too which is just a personal opinion but the cars are good too which an added bonus.

So no doubt it will drop, but it will drop to some unknown other speculative value. 

Say it should really be valued at $420, when it drops it might just be from $1400 to $1000. Or $2000 to $1500. So you can be absolutely right that it's riding a speculative bubble, but it doesn't matter, unless you call it and it completely pops.

Still praying for MSFT daily.

I had a couple grand worth of bullish vertical call spreads on silver I opened up a few weeks back, expiring this Friday.  After the moves late last week and over the weekend I wanted out, so I closed my position.  I actually made money for a change playing with vertical spreads, I mentally high five myself.

At the end of the day I realize that TD Ameritrade has duplicated my order turning it into a very unfavorable bear call spread that is absurdly in the money.  I had checked multiple times throughout the day and I had zero positions in SLV all day long but sure enough within 10 minutes of market closing ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù what the fuck.

I can only hope that TDA actually admits they fucked up, or that silver drops a bit/stays were it is so I can get out of the position tomorrow with just some fees (TDA is cheaper than it was, still not zero), theta fuckery, and slippage on trying to get out of (fairly) illiquid contracts."

* In 2018 Elon tries to desperately sell Tesla to literally anyone for $420 after recklessly trying to pump the stock of his cash burning auto manufacturer
* Zero companies are interested in acquiring Tesla at $420, including Saudi's who literally throw billions at declining oil wells
* 2020: ""Genius"" Elon Musk tweets ""Tesla stock price is too high IMO"" at $700 per share, causing shares to drop 10%
* 2 months later in 2020: Tesla is now worth $1,350 per share, up almost 100% from the ""too high"" tweet, for a total valuation worth more than Toyota and Ford combined, you know...the two companies who sell more than 15 million vehicles per year compared to Tesla's 400k
* So ""genius"" Elon thought selling Tesla for $420 per share was fair even when factoring in all of the amazing future potential...yet now the stock is worth 3x more
