I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner.

#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets after having a dong rally for past few days refuses to give up gains but have halted their rally today


**India** up 0.18% 

**Hangseng**  down 1.38% 

**Nikkei** down 0.44%


#_____________________



Europe had a much more extended rally than Asia thus they are facing a bit selling pressure in the early trade

**Dax** down1.24% 


**CAC40** down 1.07%


**FTSE** down 1.27%


#_____________________


**Dow futures (25,894.0) -285.0(-1.09%)**

#____________________

Global markets, even tho some indices are a bit down are still in a bullish trend, to summarize, the earlier resistance has become support

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Spy is currently on a buy on dips sentiment, we consider this the most profitable phase of any charts as trading this becomes easy

**Weekly major support is 307 and 310 and resistance at 314 and 320**

Today we are actually not taking any trades as we would like to see how the market reacts to 314, we still need convincing of the 314 support strength, as the action here will decide whether the spy will go ahead to test 320 or will again find balance at 307

#Personal bias is that today we will trade in a narrow range of 310 and 316 much rather a consolidation day

Would not recommend going long here as risk reward is not favourable 


#____________________


**Longterm** : it is same as before, it is very difficult to be bearish in long term view when NASDAQ itself is making new highs, we believe that Nasdaq 10k support has become as strong as spy 300 support, thus we are strongly bullish on long term, but we request you to add long term stocks in SIP mode to benefit the current volitality

#____________________

If we see from an overview, today feels like no bull or bear position is showing clarity and spy seems to have found a range to rest on for short term, usually we don't trade derivatives position when we feel there is no significant move in the either side thus we will use this period to add some stocks 




#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : ""wisdom is knowing the you don't know anything""



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market¬†(314.40) ‚àí2.65¬†(0.84%)**
