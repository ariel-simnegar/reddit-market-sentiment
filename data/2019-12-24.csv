Now literally a few hours later I'm home playing mobile games on my tablet, and I'm getting ads for a local Mediterranean restaurant.

What the fuck?! 

Never had that ad before, never Googled them, etc. Too spooky for me. 

I've heard similar incidents of people talking about things in a cab or whatever, then getting ads for it. Thought it was just a coincidence, but now I'm thinking it's something greater like phones listening in or something. Anyone have a similar story?"
