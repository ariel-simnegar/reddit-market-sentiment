Who knows, maybe this time is different.

I made a shitty website that aggregates what us idiots on here are talking about that updates in real time. Behold: [Tendies Tracker](http://tendiestracker.com)

Here are some tips I have:

* You can search stocks on the top right to look at them.
* The default chart is only looking at hour level intervals in the past day. Try setting it to something like 15m bars for 7d and you can see [much more interesting things](https://imgur.com/a/m71pWja).
* You can turn off mentions/calls/puts in the charts by clicking on the header in the chart. This is especially useful because you can see when people turned on a stock, \[[eg, ZM](https://imgur.com/vpXPYU0)\] and make the play early.
* A non-public feature is to append ?end=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (like 2020-06-03 13:30 to do a query at open on June 3) to the query to do a historical query. This will possibly be paywalled in the future, so try it out now. Give me useful feedback (about anything on the site), and I promise to give you free access. I have data for all of 2020 at least, and should have a significant part of 2019 too."

2020-06-08 03:55:16,dbo199523,1,"DD- AZUL


AZUL will be the next big pop. (Yes I know it already went up last week along with every other airline so pls stfu and let me explain). This is the perfect time to buy during the Brazilian economic downfall. Now as we all saw last week, Airlines fucking mooned. AZUL definitely had a solid gain last week as well but they have more of an opportunity to gain momentum for a few reasons. First, Brazil is about a month behind the US with COVID. They have the 2nd highest amount of cases compared to the US (pussies need to catch up and run with the big dogs). Soon (about a month or so), they will realize that COVID really isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, just like the US has, and will start opening up their country more. They already have began reopening parts of Brazil but a lot of it is still on lockdown since they are still convinced COVID is a real thing and is worth shutting down their country. 


AZUL‚Äôs chart looks just like SAVE‚Äôs chart on 6/2. AZUL also has a better debt to equity ratio than 85% of its industry peers. This stock is still heavily discounted and because corona cases are still rising in Brazil this is probably one of the last/best entry points to enter on calls if you haven‚Äôt already. 


Once these concerns of bat flu in South America have blown over, AZUL will double or triple within the next month or two from its current price. I‚Äôm balls deep in calls on almost every airline but this one in particular has tickled my fancy, strictly because Brazil is a month behind us.

$17.5c 7/17"

2020-06-08 03:36:31,Jcuellar5596,3,"Reports stemming from the financial columnist, Greg Thomson and the family of Pablo Escobar, claim the Escobar‚Äôs know the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. Allegedly, the notorious Escobar‚Äôs say that Satoshi Nakamoto was once known as a man named ‚ÄúYasutaka Nakamoto.‚Äù On June 6, 2020, an interesting theory emerged that claims the family of¬†Pablo Escobar¬†knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The well known¬†Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug boss who founded and led the Medell√≠n Cartel.

In the early eighties, Pablo Escobar‚Äôs cartel was in charge of at least 80% of the world‚Äôs cocaine sales. At the height of Escobar‚Äôs heyday, the Medell√≠n Cartel was said to be responsible for delivering 300 kilos of cocaine per day to the U.S. and abroad in 1982. Escobar‚Äôs operation made it so the drug outpaced Colombia‚Äôs coffee exports that year.

The¬†report¬†stems from Cointelegraph (CT) reporter¬†Greg Thomson¬†who spoke with a family friend called¬†Olof K. Gustaffson, CEO of¬†Escobar Inc., a company with ties to Pablo Escobar‚Äôs descendants. Gustaffson tells Thomson that they believe Bitcoin‚Äôs creator is a person named Yasutaka Nakamoto.

Yasutaka Nakamoto allegedly used to work for the Escobar family and was an engineer who purportedly also worked for Pacific West Airlines. The story highlights that Yasutaka did some cocaine smuggling runs for Pablo years ago. According to Gustaffson‚Äôs testimony, Yasutaka not only had the means to create Bitcoin, but he also was a great smuggler who removed himself from the public eye up until 1992.

Gustaffson is a ‚Äú27-year-old Swedish entrepreneur‚Äù who also claims that Yasutaka is the brother of the California Satoshi suspect,¬†Dorian Nakamoto. Gustaffson is now the chief executive officer of the multinational conglomerate that manages the Escobar family empire.

Thomson‚Äôs report shows that there is a¬†Los Angeles Times¬†editorial that discusses a Hughes Aircraft Co. worker named Yasutaka A. Nakamoto. The Times story says that Yasutaka escaped a car bomb and managed to live after his life was threatened. ‚ÄúHughes employee Yasutaka A. Nakamoto, 39, at first thought his car had been burglarized/

You need to know the ATH for these stocks that have begun their rebuilding process. Example: BA - $391, UAL - $90-ish, etc. The highest resistence levels and ATH's are a huge part of the formula. BA will continue their high rise as their cap + their old resistence + a million other things before Covid will pump them continously.

MGM's ATH is 34. Before you FOMO into calls, do your DD on them. I realistically see a 28 EOW then a SLOW steady climb back to 34 ‚Äî with quite a few dips. If they spike a couple dollars on Monday & I have no calls then i'm staying the fuck away from them. There will be a big sell off on them.

There's so so much into the equation with these companies and their stocks. Be careful with your FOMO decisions.."

https://www.nrk.no/norge/norsk-forsker-skaper-strid-om-virusets-opphav_-_-dette-viruset-har-ikke-en-naturlig-opprinnelse-1.15043634

- Sequences in the surface of the coronavirus indicate that it does not come from nature, but is probably developed by Chinese and American scientists. This is the opinion of Norwegian vaccine scientist Birger S√∏rensen. He is supported by the former spy chief of the British. Birger S√∏rensen in Immunovac NOT NATURAL: Vaccine scientist Birger S√∏rensen believes the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not come from nature. The picture is from 2009. Peter Svaar Journalist Share Published today at 6:49 p.m. In a recent study published in the acclaimed Quarterly Review of Biophysics, S√∏rensen and the British professor Angus Dalgleish show that the coronavirus's so-called spike protein contains sequences that appear to be artificially inserted.

- Here you will find inserts in the corona virus INSERTS: These are the sequences S√∏rensen thinks point to that the virus has no natural origin. The sequences were first described by Chinese scientists. The research duo also points out that the virus has hardly mutated since it began to infect humans, suggesting that it was already fully adapted to humans. According to S√∏rensen, this is quite unusual for viruses that cross species barriers.

Cont'd.

Most people seem to catch cold viruses in the fall and winter. So I don't expect a big spike from the protests. But since the virus is still around, it will spread more in the fall and be really bad in the winter.

In the first wave, it hit a bit late into cold/flu season... so it didn't get a chance to spread to it's full potential. For the second wave, it has a big base already in place so it will spread more this time. It could be many orders of magnitude worse since we didn't fully eliminate it in the first wave."

Let's look at what happened to MGM last week.

Monday, pumped at open, dumped by EOD. I bought during the pump, was down $1000 by EOD.

Tuesday, broke even. Rose back to Monday open price.

Wednesday, pumped even more. Woke up to +$2000.

Thursday reopenings. Moonshot. +$15,300. Sold in the morning, but continued to rise throughout the day with smaller dips each time. Rebought EOD.

Friday, moonshotted. 23.50 in the morning, and back to Thursday close levels by EOD. If I sold in the morning and rebought EOD, could have had another $15,300.

**If you had a position from Friday:** Sell at open Monday? Rebuy EOD.

**If you want to get in on the train: wait for an EOD or midday dip from whales taking profits.**

Excalibur Casino is reopening Thursday due to high demand and bookings for Vegas this month. Should see pumps midweek."

You decide to go play some roulette at the casino. You call up a taxi.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck!‚Äù the taxi driver says. ‚ÄúI just came from there. There‚Äôs a table rigged to always come up black! You‚Äôre gonna be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck buddy! There‚Äôs a table that always comes up black! You‚Äôre gonna be so damn rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‚ÄòBig Jay‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is your lucky day.‚Äù he whispers to you as he leans in close. ‚ÄúFor a short time I‚Äôve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you‚Äôll be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

As you lay your cash down and load up on puts you give Big Jay a wink. ""Red"".

You see the confused expression on Big Jay‚Äôs face as he spins the wheel. ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù he calls with a sigh.

‚ÄúThis game is fucking rigged!‚Äù you shout as your puts expire worthless."

Any money that people want to invest with is going straight to equities. There's nowhere else to put it if you're looking for returns. Bonds? No way, they're not increasing in rates even with the market booming. Commodities? Look at gold, it's practically useless right now. Savings? LOL. The only place to put your money to make money is in equities, that's why we're booming so hard, along with the emotions of opening back up and going to normal. This wont stop until it really hits us in the face. Until we realize unemployment isn't going to be remedied, businesses aren't going to go right back to the same revenue they once had, GDP/inflation is realized, or fed raises rates. 
 


I made the guess that the 26th of June is when that realization starts coming to a head and we'll have a slight correction. That weekend will be red into the Monday. Tuesday we'll go back to the green train ride until probably later in July when PPP/UE benefits start coming to an end and we don't have another stimulus being passed. If we get into August without another stimulus, with no extension to PPP/UE, that will be the time we really start seeing the next leg down. Calls for 2 more weeks, then short puts, then probably go 30-50% calls with the rest cash until mid July.. then play some 30% puts and see where we go before going full throttle puts."

What suggestions do they give retirement age boomers? Income investing over growth. What's a boomer to do when they can't get returns from the bond market or banks? Invest in stable, income producing, mega giants, at a discount.

Check your local credit union/online bank/investment bank's APY. Ally is offering 1.25 APY.

Weed is going to be legalized? Guess who benefits? MO, who owns 45% of CRON.

They also did a big PR push [https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-announces-strategic-moves-to-further-position-company-for-success/](https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-announces-strategic-moves-to-further-position-company-for-success/) on how they are turning everything back on and bringing all employees back to 100%

&#x200B;

2. I'm still debating whether to go TOTAL or SHELL, they are both strong companies, have not been this cheap since 2004, are consolidated oil services, and both should benefit from the OPEC news, which one will swing harder, beats me. I'm leaning towards Shell simply because i like the company better.

3.  Banco Santander of Spain was not this low after the GFC, and European Printers have also started going BRRRRRR so why the fuck not? (and that is the extend of my DD on this one folks)

4. RCL (Royal Caribbean), Cruises have been covered to death on this Sub, I prefer RCL to CCL or Norwegian simply because of RCL being American and natural to NYSE, where the printer is going BRRRRRRRR

Secondary (smaller plays)

Short HERTZ because wtf people how can people be buying that shit? c'mon! I know the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent but the stock will be literally worth $0 within \_days\_

Play around with Eventbrite because venues opening up means ticket sales coming back, but I'm not sure I buy it.

Monday, pumped at open, dumped by EOD. I bought during the pump, was down $1000 by EOD.

Tuesday, broke even. Rose back to Monday open price.

Wednesday, pumped even more. Woke up to +$2000.

Thursday reopenings. Moonshot. +$15,300. Sold in the morning, but continued to rise throughout the day with smaller dips each time. Rebought EOD.

Friday, moonshotted. 23.50 in the morning, and back to Thursday close levels by EOD. If I sold in the morning and rebought EOD, could have had another $15,300.

**If you had a position from Friday:** Sell at open Monday? Rebuy EOD.

**If you want to get in on the train: wait for an EOD or midday dip from whales taking profits.**

Not only is this potentially surprising to me, but when you really stop and take a moment to actually consider the implications‚Ä¶.it is one of the most terrifying sentences ever written. Because after all this time for nobody to really be sure beyond a doubt that caused it means that it could happen again. More than that: it could be happening every single day and nobody is ever going to know it.
