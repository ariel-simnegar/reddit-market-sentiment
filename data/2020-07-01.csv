Might be a dumb question and sound very autist (bear with me) but if I have, let's say, a massive $500k account (not saying I do but just hypothetical), can I just buy calls with my entire account (all-in) with an expense premium that's very close to the break even from the currency price with 2-3 month out expiry (just to be a tad bit safe) AND make fucking bank and keep repeating this strategy? 

Take GE for example. It‚Äôs currently 6.73. I buy $500,000 worth of October calls which is like 1800 contracts , $4 strike price. $2.82 premium. So $6.82 is my break even. If GE goes to 6.92, I‚Äôll already be up like 40 grand. So technically if it goes to 6.92 the next day, I‚Äôll make an easy 40 grand. I never knew this would be so simple, it‚Äôs like too good to be true. Don‚Äôt more people actually do this, assuming they have a fucking massive capital? It‚Äôs like free rich money."
