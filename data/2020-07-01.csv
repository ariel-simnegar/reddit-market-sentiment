Might be a dumb question and sound very autist (bear with me) but if I have, let's say, a massive $500k account (not saying I do but just hypothetical), can I just buy calls with my entire account (all-in) with an expense premium that's very close to the break even from the currency price with 2-3 month out expiry (just to be a tad bit safe) AND make fucking bank and keep repeating this strategy? 

Take GE for example. It’s currently 6.73. I buy $500,000 worth of October calls which is like 1800 contracts , $4 strike price. $2.82 premium. So $6.82 is my break even. If GE goes to 6.92, I’ll already be up like 40 grand. So technically if it goes to 6.92 the next day, I’ll make an easy 40 grand. I never knew this would be so simple, it’s like too good to be true. Don’t more people actually do this, assuming they have a fucking massive capital? It’s like free rich money."

#____________________


Asian markets are rallying hard, some of them have broken their intermediate resistance and giving a Bullish stance over all


**India** up 1.4% 

**Hangseng** up 2.72% (was closed yesterday that's why dong rally)

**Nikkei** up  0.11%


#_____________________



Europe indices are in a similar scenario like Asian market and are giving Bullish vibe too

**Dax** up 1.93% 


**CAC40** up 1.6%


**FTSE** up 0.9%


#_____________________


**Dow** Futures (25,823.5) +248.5(+0.97%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in a range determined by the past weeks action but respecting their support and bouncing back along with breaking short term resistance makes it bullish overall

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Classic trend is your friend case thus we are avoiding to take any short position and are adding longs on dips, short chart suggests that we have transitioned from sell on rally to buy on dipa


Major support is still 305 and 307 and resistance is at 314 and 320,


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 307 - 314 with an expectation that 307 becomes a short term support


Highly recommend to the people talking longs today to have you stops at 305, as breaking 305 would invite 300 again

#____________________


**Longterm** : for long term investing we keep an eye on Nasdaq charts and were skeptical when Nasdaq was below its 10k psychological support, but sirprisingly that support is reclaimed and we are currently well above 10k, 10k psychological is likely to stay in the long run this we recommend to go long using SIP mode to benefit volitality

(Alert : avoid Russel stocks cause the economic condition most likely will make big companies bigger and will wipe out small companies, the directional difference between Nasdaq, Dow, S and p and Russel is likely to continue )


#______________________

Even after the support of 300 being respected, we are relatively flat for past month, highly recommend to book profits on upper end of ranges, or at least pushing your Stop losses if riding all the way





#____________________


Random tip for the day : ""if your derivative order gets filled almost immediately the curse of mahem suggest that trade gonna end bad  ""

#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 


#____________________


Asian markets are rallying hard, some of them have broken their intermediate resistance and giving a Bullish stance over all


**India** up 1.4% 

**Hangseng** up 2.72% (was closed yesterday that's why dong rally)

**Nikkei** up  0.11%


#_____________________



Europe indices are in a similar scenario like Asian market and are giving Bullish vibe too

**Dax** up 1.88% 


**CAC40** up 1.5%


**FTSE** up 0.87%


#_____________________


**Dow** Futures ( 25,803.5 ) +228.5(+0.89%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in a range determined by the past weeks action but respecting their support and bouncing back along with breaking short term resistance makes it bullish overall

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Classic trend is your friend case thus we are avoiding to take any short position and are adding longs on dips, short chart suggests that we have transitioned from sell on rally to buy on dipa


Major support is still 305 and 307 and resistance is at 314 and 320,


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 307 - 314 with an expectation that 307 becomes a short term support


Highly recommend to the people talking longs today to have you stops at 305, as breaking 305 would invite 300 again

#____________________


**Longterm** : for long term investing we keep an eye on Nasdaq charts and were skeptical when Nasdaq was below its 10k psychological support, but sirprisingly that support is reclaimed and we are currently well above 10k, 10k psychological is likely to stay in the long run this we recommend to go long using SIP mode to benefit volitality

(Alert : avoid Russel stocks cause the economic condition most likely will make big companies bigger and will wipe out small companies, the directional difference between Nasdaq, Dow, S and p and Russel is likely to continue )


#______________________

Even after the support of 300 being respected, we are relatively flat for past month, highly recommend to book profits on upper end of ranges, or at least pushing your Stop losses if riding all the way





#____________________


Random tip for the day : ""if your derivative order gets filled almost immediately the curse of mahem suggest that trade gonna end bad  ""

Motivational quote of the day 

""if I was as half as good as I was

I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be""

The ticker she decided on was SNAP. The next day the stock went down about 1%, she had her first “loss” but didn’t stress it, sat and waited, watched, for a week and kept seeing her newly invested money to become smaller and smaller.

The very next week I texted her to ask how she was doing because of how much her contracts had decreased in value and that darling little girl said to me, “elxjefe, I don’t have toilet paper hands, I ain’t worried about a slight loss, I’m holding this until I make $1000 off of
It”.


A few days passed and she sent me a screenshot of her $800 profit from her trade. Not quite $1000.


The cooler thing...
She texted me again today a screenshot of a trade she made last week... SRNE, 150% profit.



Moral of the story, trade like my little sister and you dum dums might actually make some money"

Tesla delivered 88,496 vehicles in the first quarter of the year and produced 102,672 vehicles. Model 3 and Model Y together made up 87,282 of the production total.

Analysts are targeting 72k for q2.
 
I imagine 50k max... no one is commuting to work and no one needs a new car because no one is driving. Oh, and April and may were highest savings rate for Americans ever. People are scared and not buying cars. 

I believe the “everyone emails” are pumps to draw attention to TSLA as he always does. An everyone email is obviously going to press - Elon isn’t dumb. I think the “break even” thing is vague and a weird motivational attempt."

Since beer flu started the market has moved in roughly a monthly cycle - I call it the rags to riches cycle.

This started with the massive sell off around March - ie when the market was on its rag and we were swimming in a sea of red. We then built up quickly with all the stimulus until another selloff in mid April (Yes I do know there were other mini dips here and there and same over May and June). Then  a couple of fake vaccine stories pumped everything and there was another sell of just before the middle of May when it was ""that time of the month"" again.

June the cycle repeated. We are now approaching another high with vaccine news which I predict will last until around 10th-12th July when the market is on its rag again. I have no idea what will trigger that sell off but it could be something like deaths catching up to all the cases coming out. 

Anyway I really have no idea about this - it just seems to be a pattern thats happened but pls dont listen seriously as I don't have anything to substantiate this!"

Now what is left to do is implement rules to control this thing while being as little disruptive to daily life as possible.

Texas, Florida and Arizona having a surge because they were basically spared during the first wave? You can do 95% of all tasks while wearing a mask. WTF is this talk about lockdown? What for?

People running around screaming- their homes burning down... this fire was fucking cooking. We show up in grass gear thinking we are just gonna put out some weeds and then bam you better get changed quick this persons fucking house is burning down. Craziest fire of my life- flowing 250 gpm with a 2 1/2 hose absolutely kicking my ass for an hour. 

Then afterwards I Had to shit so bad. No where to go we were gonna be there for hours overhauling this thing.

We managed to save 2 out of the 5 units but they were both still partially damaged pretty bad... So I sneak into this burned up bathroom and I just blow it up. Damn toilet had no water in it either. I poured what was left of a partially melted pine sol over the top tho.

2020-07-02 04:17:30,spnshfirefighter,26,"We’re constantly given opportunities yet many cease to take advantage. 

You see a stock running but fail to get in because you feel like you’ve lost the edge, only to see it run day in and day out. 

Why? Because you think you’re better than buying in after someone else.  

What you fail to realize is that those who succeed at this aren’t buying the bottom of anything. They’re buying the momentum and having an exit plan. 

Here’s some simple yet invaluable rules to help you fucks. 

1. If a stock hits all time highs, you should buy calls and not puts. Odds are that it’ll keep going through all time highs until it doesn’t.  

2. Don’t just buy something because it’s the new hot trend. 

3. Exit in stages. I do 1/3rds. Diamond handing a full position is dumb as fuck. Sure you’ll get lucky but you’ll lose it all many times over. Don’t be a cuck. 

4. Tech is here to stay, if you want to bet big and give yourself the best odds, play the tech. 

5.  Don’t buy stocks under $10, or even better $50.

6. Swinging a losing position because you feel like it’ll catch back up is retarded.  It’s ok to buy higher, it’s not OK to hold losers or add to them. 

7. 50% down on options play? Cut it. 

8. 50% up on options play, take 1/3 or half off the table. Let the rest ride. 

9. Don’t hope and pray for results. Expect them and if it doesn’t go your way look for the next play. 

10. Tell your wife to not forget her dirty panties next time she’s over."

Say what you will about covid, the lockdown devastated us, economically.  Hospitality is half destroyed, Main Street will take years to come back.  A rally in the middle of that is odd.

I think everyone remembers 09, and remembers how quickly things came back.  I think this rally is mostly retail, which is why it’s been such low volume, with MMS helping out with stocks that will benefit and not helping out with stocks that won’t.

I think that’s why we keep getting these false starts,  retail tries pouring into all sorts of dumb stuff. IVR is a good example - that ticker may never come back. I think retail tried to start a rally and smart money refused to accelerate it."

Stop buying puts because the news is talking about infections or whatever. Yeah it’s getting worse and the government is incompetent, but that’s well understood by now. People won’t sell unless they have to. Even the guys in The Big Short didn’t correctly predict when the crash would happen (yes due to fraud from the rating agencies and the banks, but what makes you think that large financial institutions will be honest now?).

I know our poots are bleeding but hear me out before you exit them...
The vaccine pumps are legit fake ones. That's why we see price action like last day EOD. Nobody is really buying the idea of real economic recovery as the vaccines even if they are the successful ones, will not comes any time soon. Upcoming quarters won't report growth just because vaccine is coming at end of 2020. In addition to that, Fed the main driver of this rally is now slowly moving out of the game, shrinking its balancesheet. As cases are resurging, we are seeing administrators taking cautious actions of public places ban, lockdown etc. Hospital Capacity thing is not clear to me but that's still a possibility. At this point almost every possible good news is priced in and market is struggling to cross the 315 barrier since last month. This is peculiar as with the velocity of april-may pumping we would have blown through 325 easily and have started eyeing new ATH. But it didn't happen. Like for a month it's not allowed to happen. 

So, there is no point switching to bull gang at this point. Just stop buying 0dte and play longer expiry puts with 💎🖐️ This shit isn't over yet !"

2020-07-02 01:52:54,Huckleberry_Ginn,12,"# An explanation of GEX and DIX (General), and my short-term bearish views. I would appreciate questions or critiques

Long story short, GEX is the “other side” of positions. I heard it was $8 trillion. This high numbers means there are tons of calls in the marketplace. Calls, however, are typically used as a hedge to curb risk without selling an entire portfolio. So, you can assume people are scared.

DIX is basically “dark pool transactions.” Sometimes, big players use “dark pools” to trade tons of securities to avoid the impact to the market. DIX is around 43 which is low. Meaning, these large entities are selling off now. 

Typically, retail is the last money to move. There’s too much information to process and account for. 

For my own personal belief, junk bond outflows roared yesterday... the highest inflowing asset class was 7-10 year treasuries... its a flight to quality. 

All signs are pointing to people actually afraid (by people, I mean large investors who actually sway and move the market, not two-inch Timmy on his Robinhood app).

So, I am short term bearish, because let’s face it: Coronavirus is a problem. Is anyone expecting cases to drop in the next month? No. We’re breaching hospital capacity in many states already. I’m not a dooms day advocate. If you get coronavirus,  I don’t think you’re dead. It’s  clearly targeting elder people and immunodeficient folk. But, overcrowded hospitals are a HUGE hamper on a fully functioning economy. 

Also, terror and emotions are real. People will see freezer trucks of bodies, like in NYC in early April. We are feeling comfortable because we’re looking at the NY and other curves. I genuinely believe coronavirus was floating around the US far before we realized; its why we had unbelievable high antibody test results in NY. 

The current curve in many states is going to be *far* worse than NY. I just hope the medicine and knowledge we have now will help. 

A FULL lockdown causes cases to drop in about a month (see New York)... by the time we reach lockdown status in FL, TX, etc., we will be so fucked. 

Wow, long answer, sorry."

Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: ""Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales.""   

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.  

The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy. A quiet rage flares behind your eyes, then fades to sadness.

When the government (or its proxy the Federal Reserve) invests in a corporation (bonds or equities), you would think the government now has more power over that corporation since they're the creditor in this relationship. But actually, that corporation in turn wields power and influence over the government. To protect its investment, the government has to then support that corporation's continued success through their policy choices.  


That's the real danger of every motherfucker in the country using the S&P 500 index fund as their primary vehicle for retirement funds. It means we HAVE to support the valuations of those companies, or the whole country suffers.

Everyone I know is switching from a Honda Civic to the TeslaX, just because it's so much affordable from the gas savings, you know what I mean?  I mean I think a $600 billion valuation is fair, why the fuck should APPL or AMZN have all the fun?

This pandemic has really shown me how manipulated this shit is. Examples
A) Government sponsored pumps
B) Low volume melt ups
C) Random sector rotations
D) Markets completely replaced bonds with tech stocks
E) Futures to pump or dump prices pre market
F) The fuckery that is the VIX that is suppressed on red days for some weird ass reason
G) Fed backstopping everything

Oil - Exxon * 23, Chevron * 11 = 2k

Housing - FNF * 33 = 1k

Hotel - MARR *  11, HLT * 13 = 2k

All these stocks have a straight growing graph for past 5 years,
No margin so no need to be scared of margin calls, I will keep investing small amounts every month as I get paid.

I forgot how much a lot of you fucks rely on bullshit logic with no attention to charts or market data...no wonder I wasn’t seeing clearly.

Try spending the time you normally spend on here looking at level 2 DOM movements and playing with different chart styles.

All indications are telling me to buy every put they are selling on the Qs and Spy. But I scroll through here and people are actually putting their hard earned money on bullish bets when Nasdaq is at all time high and COVID wave 2 crashing down on us. Worst part is the reasoning behind the “bet” is cooked numbers or “don’t fight the fed”

As far as SPY SPX ES go, 3115-3125 is going to sell off hard (at least IMO). BUTTTT if 3125 is broken, the short squeeze will rocket us up to 3200 in a flash. Do yourself a favor and buy puts on the Qs based on those S&P levels. Nasdaq is creating a huge gap compared to S&P. It will correct to close the gap and bring a bigger percentage sell off when the time comes.

On top of that, compared to other luxury automobiles, Tesla's cabins always feel so cheap and composed of poor material.

>Mr. Paulson’s decision to hand his investors’ their cash back and turn his firm into a family office has been long telegraphed as assets at his firm have fallen and returns declined.

And it won't stop. Not anytime soon. But we're seeing reality kick in as a few companies hit bankruptcy or make public offerings. 

Remember. If a company is failing, the purpose of wall street as a tool is a lifeline. But it wont be tapped into right away. If its constantly going up, companies will wait until the right moment. 

So when the weight of debt shifts to the fresh 20 year old Bob the investor, it's going push the poor/middle class into a lower state of wealth. And in many cases. Bankruptcy. This will cause a chain of disaster that will eventually hit the banks. And this time, the fed cant help. They'll have to coin a new term, because -Black Monday- wont be strong enough. It's going to be a slow bleed, and then, along with the ended cares act, the bears will reign supreme while the bulls grovel in debt and insolvency."

 ""As  far as when the delivery and production report will be released, Tesla  releases such reports within three days of quarter end. It is worth  bearing in mind that the Nasdaq stock exchange is closed on Friday, July  3rd. If Tesla's numbers are ahead of expectations, they may target a  Thursday morning release to prevent the numbers getting lost in the  shuffle of the holiday weekend.

Historically,  Tesla has released the delivery and production report on the second day  following quarter end 52% of the time. However, for Q2 results, that  number jumps to 60%.

This implies that these customers have an external bank they prefer to use for actual banking needs and SQ is mostly just a p2p funnel 

If SQ becomes the “main bank” for these users over time then they miss out on those fees, and will earn almost nothing on deposits and should be valued more like a bank. 

They do make money from debit purchase but don’t break it out and would guess revenue from that is a lot smaller than the transfer fees."
