If you come into these threads everyday and state one of the following:

2. We are going to hit $2XX, trap greedy retail fomos, then crash
3. Circuit breaker tomorrow guaranteed
4. SPY $200p ~~4/17~~ ~~5/15~~ 6/19 guaranteed
5. Stonks are green but bread gonna cost $10,000 because hyperinflation
6. Whistleblowers are going to prove that the Fed was buying SPY

no one will remember the next day, because no one cares about broke people who provide nothing of substance.  What I'm saying is, eventually you may be right.  On that day, if it ever comes, you can link to one of the 500000 shitty posts you made and say ""I told you"".

 Like maybe they are piling into meme stocks, but retail doesn't completely rotate money out of a sector and into another one or push things up overnight.

Oil is a factor then its not.  Unemployment is the next catalyst then it's not.  Drug tests, expectations, guidance, earnings, wtf.  Entire 2 months shows me it's complete dog shit and people just rewriting history in their mind. Entire thing has been eye opening to me in feeding people like us what we want to believe.

2020-04-30 06:56:38,morten_tor,16,"I'm hoping to goad more people into drinking their own piss. 

I am worried the joke is on me, because most of these guys selling calls and buying puts are probably already drinking it habitually.

Joking aside, things are looking bleak for the real economy from where I am sitting. When friends and family gets laid off, it affects me, even if my income is not (currently) in jeopardy, and even though I don't have to worry about money for the foreseeable future, I am not spending nearly as much as I did just 3 months ago on shits and giggles. Vacation this summer is going to be cheap too. Don't even want to travel even if I could. And when we finally can, it will be 4 hours wait in the airport and airfare will be 10x more expensive. No thanks. 

I am deeply concerned that we are entering a vicious circle when it comes to regular working stiffs. We bought some time with the stimulus packages. Just as we did in 2007 or 08 when people got that tax rebate check. This means that - for the time being - companies can pay their AWS and Azure bills. They are still advertising, putting on a show, but the light are on late in the CFO's office as he tries to reconcile the dwindling revenue and mounting debt. The last thing  they stop paying is their AWS bill, it's as critical as electricity and water these days.

The irony is that this is so evident that lots of people are short, while failing to grasp that the stock market is very different from the economy. Yes, the market will eventually tank, but it will take far longer and be far less trivial to capitalize on than you might imagine.

It's not about the virus any longer; as brutal as it might seem, we are going to live with shorter life expectancy due to this. It's a truth that most people will and have accepted - especially when faced with the loss of your job. It's not considered polite to throw grandpa under the buss, ""just"" so that we can keep our job and put dinner on the table, and perhaps have a Disney vacation every now and then. Polite or not, this what we will do. And while I feel a bit of shame saying this, I think it's the right thing to do.

The alibi will be Remvisidir. Having worked in the medical industry, I know how good these guys are at massaging numbers, and they will eventually find a situation where it ""works"" (e.g. it works on women, 37-43 y/o, smoker w. 3 kids). No-one is going to pay attention to that little caveat. Keep in mind, it's not a new drug, and if it was such a miracle drug against covid, we'd probably know by now. Sure - we will be able to concoct something that can keep people alive. We have done so with HIV, and we can do something similar with covid.

So, when we DO open, a lot of people will probably be disappointed to learn that the company really doesn't want them back, and in fact, they will now lay of another 10% of the staff. They will find that there are no more $1200 checks in the mail, and they will probably have to cash the one they had framed and hung over the TV with Trumps signature on it.

Politicians will look at the stock market and pad themselves on the back. Republicans will become ""fiscally conservative"" once again, and block any new stimulus that smells like communism. After all, an abundance of poor, desperate workers is how empires are made. 

Right now, the market is driven by shorts caught on the wrong side of the equation, as long as you have short sellers that are panic buying to cover their positions, you will have a surging stock market. It will surge way, way beyond previous ATH, and there is no telling when it will turn, but when it does... oh baby... it's going to be gruesome."

Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo.

2020-04-30 05:57:25,reddev87,8,"There are fundamentally three reasons to sell stock.

1.) You need the money to spend in daily life.

2.) You think a different investment has better returns.

3.) You're scared that your current holdings are going to go bankrupt/becoming insolvent/go to zero.

Big picture, 1 is immaterial, very few people ever need to sell their holdings out of necessity. 

2 is where you typically have the biggest flucuations. Capital will flow between equities/credit/currencies/etc. depending on what has the appropriate yield/risk ratio.

3 is what you see in the case of a crash. People flood out of equities in fear that the companies they hold will will go bankrupt or the investing institutions will become insolvent. This is what triggered the '28 and '08 crashes - there was a very real risk of zero. This was also a possibility in the early days of the current crash until the Fed stepped in and guaranteed they'd act as the lender of last resort under any circumstance for basically anything. This removed the risk of zero. 

So why would anyone sell stock now? Why would there be another leg down? It would have to come from #2 and right now there are no better opportunities. If one emerges we'll see a drop, but what would that be?"

2020-04-30 05:19:08,hoopaholik91,4,"So as a newly wiped out bear here is a 'fairly' reasonable bull thesis I can come up with while drinking heavily.

Let's say we lose roughly a year of economic progress because of this pandemic. Decently round number, pulled it out of my ass.

Assuming 10% growth per year, that means we should be ~10% behind what we would have without COVID.

Yes the top was 340, but that was two months ago. It probably would be 350 now, so a 10% drop would mean that 315 is fair value.

Obviously we are in a market that is more emotional than rational (I mean the entire market was stupid enough to think that 220 was too high a month ago). So we probably blow right past the 'rational' number I pulled out of my ass. So we could easily see 330 or higher before settling at the correct number, it would be less wrong than what we believed the downside was.

So if you are riding the wave I don't see why we stop any time soon. Enjoy the tendies I guess."

From what I've gathered, Chinese airlines have recovered quite well, not diving as much due to expected government support. However, IAG has caught my eye. Went through the BS and actually not looking terribly bad. 

4 bil in cash for 2019 Q4 report is already looking great, I'm sure that liquidity will grow when they announce May 4th.

Debt sitting at 14 bil which isn't bad at all

BS is looking similar to DAL and slightly stronger than UAL. Not too familiar with the approach Europe is taking to coronavirus and how this impacts airlines that are largely international flights. Essentially, IAG has room to recover and with earnings reports coming out soon, I'm looking into catching it on the ride up as well."

If I issue an IPO on MUSK would anyone here capitulate if the price was right?

$16 a share or so?

Could I then sell calls on this person/security/entity?

How many have ever tried this?

What about instead of we try JEROME?

Is buying a JEROME 5/15 401c one of those resonance feedback loops that brings the simulation down?

AM I NEO?"
2020-04-30 02:06:24,Dans2016,3,"Gilead's GILD miracle beervirus drug news - in case if you missed (and yes, this ""positive test results"" do not carry much scientific merit):

Trial participants who received  remdesivir recovered in an average of 11  days compared with 15 days for  patients in the control group, who  received a placebo. Eight percent  of remdesivir patients died during the  trial versus 11 percent in the  placebo group.

Gilead  released  its own study results this morning suggesting that severely ill   patients receiving five days of remdesivir fared just as well as   patients receiving a 10-day dosing regimen. More than half of both   dosing groups were discharged from the hospital within two weeks of   beginning their medication.

Eight  percent of people in the five-day group died while 11 percent in the  10-day group died. But  another 10 percent in the longer dosing arm had  to discontinue  treatment because of serious side effects, and the study  lacked a  control group.

Gilead   said the data also suggests that people who received remdesivir early   in their infection seemed to fare better than those that received it   later. The study is not a traditional trial with a placebo arm to   compare against remdesivir for effectiveness, earning Gilead some   criticism from policy experts over sharing the news alongside the NIAID   results.

 ""Piggybacking the severe trial release on \[the NIAID study\] is the part  which is unjustifiable,"" said Peter Bach, director of Memorial  Sloan-Kettering's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes. Calling  Gilead's results positive even though they came from a trial without a  control group ""has no basis in scientific inquiry,"" he added."

In all seriousness though... this is not fucking good, and I'm starting to get that ""pre-2008/9"" financial meltdown feeling in my gut. US economy isn't opening up May 1st, so Trump is going to lie about it; Even if it does open up the long term impact is more COVID and more economic recession for a short term 2-3 month gain in the stock market (not the economy). COVID cases are going to skyrocket for all the retards that prematurely end quarantine for their cities/states. The Fed printer is stuck wide open. Unemployment isn't even leveling off yet. No one is spending cash on anything except food, rent, and utilities; No one gives a shit about Apple's new phone. At some point the massive glaring discrepancy between the economy and the stock market is going to be quite difficult to hide. 

Someone is going to make an ass fuck load of money when the economy tanks again- or if this BS ETF bubble goes nuclear. I'm betting by June or July or maybe early fall right around election time."

2020-04-30 00:43:33,DrUNC83,12,"This was posted by someone named JordanLeDoux or something on investing and I thought it was an amazing write up 


“The problem isn't really that the bears are wrong. They are almost surely correct, because the fundamentals dictate so. Reality dictates so.

However, what they bears are really discussing is economics, not investing. The difference is that economics is not nearly as concerned with time horizon, and thus, it is usually foolish to make investment decisions (which tend to be much more sensitive to time) based on economic analysis. (EDIT: Additionally, economics is almost entirely unconcerned with, and generally makes no indication of, how an individual should make decisions. It is instead concerned with assessing the future and present based on the result of the decisions which are made in the current existing circumstances.)

They are 100% related, and the market will eventually, no matter who is doing what, be subject to the reality of the economy. That is just a fact, (and it is the fact that bears are crying about now). But when you change your investment (from cash to assets, or assets to cash) you are intensely affected by the specific timing. Economics says very little about specific timing, it is concerned about broad trends and broad markets over broad periods... especially macroeconomics which are primarily the type of economics that are being debated back and forth.

The disservice is that the people arguing against the bears are telling them they are wrong about the facts. They are not. The virus and the measures the global economy has taken will 100% without a doubt cause a much larger problem in the economy and the markets.

But even during the worst economic situations, some markets are strong, and some businesses are strong. There are absolutely businesses, and thus individual stocks, whose fundamentals in this situation actually indicate a good deal. A bear market isn't everyone being losers, it's that there are more losers than winners by aggregate invested capital. That doesn't mean that all capital is underperforming.

What needs to be explained to the bears, and no one seems to be doing, is not that they are wrong. It's that their analysis doesn't lead to any actionable information.

So you say that this will lead to a huge rise in foreclosures, maybe even more than the 2008 financial crisis? That could definitely be true. It will almost definitely lead to an increase in foreclosures. How do you take advantage of that? By having enough cash to purchase a foreclosed property at auction sometime in the next 5-10 years.

So you say that this will lead to a 40-60% drop from peak in the S&P 500? That could also definitely be true. How do you take advantage of that? Probably by selling LEAP calls, not by purchasing puts that expire next month or next week. But if you look at what you can actually sell those for, (we'll assume a spread because we're not stupid enough to sell naked LEAPs), you could sell the June 2021 300/305 call spread on SPY for ~$210 per contract, with a capital requirement of $500. But there's a lot of risk in that, for contract that you're risking $1.38 for ever $1 of potential profit on. There's early assignment risk, which is MUCH worse on LEAPs. There's the risk that the Fed uses monetary policy to transform the downturn into an inflationary one instead, which would result in the market going up while real purchasing power goes down.

What about purchasing a LEAP put instead? Well, the June 2021 250 put will cost you ~$1,860 today, and it still isn't protected from the risk of an inflationary recession. (In fact, it performs even worse in such a case.)

Or what if the downturn does come, but governments around the world are able to use measures that are bad in the long term to defer it? What if that doesn't happen for about another year? Sure, the 10 year prospect would get even worse, but exactly what instrument are you going to use to bet that the market goes down over a period of 10 years in real terms instead of nominal terms?

The bears are 100% right. Unfortunately, there's not much they, or anyone else, can do about it. This whole thing is a shit situation. It's shit for us investors regardless of the market, it's shit for families, it's shit for politicians who are stuck with nothing but options that will be unpopular, it's shit for the working class who are probably going to be totally fucked by a combination of the economy (which much more directly affects employment than markets) and automation or other efficiency improvements.

What the bears need to be told is this:

Yes, you're right, the economy is kinda fucked. Unfortunately, none of those things that you think let you profit off a fucked economy are likely to work, so you're probably going to have to deal with a fucked economy and bad investments if you try. This isn't really because markets are inherently dishonest, it's that most markets measure the value of capital, not the value of the economy itself.

The only real tool to bet against an entire economy is to short the currency that economy uses or use commodity futures, but unfortunately since most governments have the power to directly affect and control their currency, that isn't guaranteed either, and it's pretty difficult to do that if it's the same currency you earn money in. Additionally, commodity futures may not be available or priced attractively on the timescales that you might be right about the economy on, and they can be affected in the short term by speculative demand based on inflationary concerns as well.

The only truly well-positioned people for this kind of situation are those whole have enormous amounts of capital to expand a business they own and are able to rapidly adapt to industry changes that allow them to get enormous return in volatile economic circumstances while also being connected enough to the people who control the actual power over currency, etc. to be able to accurately assess such risk.

None of us are those people, so none of those options are available to us.

Every retail investor is going to be fucked by this somehow, and you won't be any different just because you see it coming.

EDIT:

And for those who doubt the idea of an inflationary crash, it's basically the only way that a government can maximally protect the rich, and the only thing they have to do is fuck the poor and middle class in a way that the poor and middle class don't even really understand. I can't really be confident about any politician rejecting that idea, given history and how our societies are constructed.

And hedges against inflation, such as gold, don't necessarily protect you from economic component of a ""crash"", just the inflation side.

The ""real"" way to ""win"" is to pick the business that is going to come out ahead 1-2 years from now. The reason this is foolishness for us retail investors, and a golden ticket for most of the extremely wealthy, is that most of the wealthy have (at least some) control over how the business tries to come out ahead 1-2 years from now, either from being an executive, or from being a large investor that the company consults/keeps appraised. Thus they are not nearly as exposed to the mistakes of others, and are more reliant on their own mistakes or brilliance.”"

So I’m thinking up to ~3150-3200, followed by an aggressive move down to 2300-2400, then the Fed starts buying equities directly in huge amounts and it goes to 5000-6000+. Eventually that fails and we get a 90% drop and the long awaited global debt deflation and 10-15 year depression.

 I live in Georgia. Our governor opened up the economy on Monday, allowing restaurants, barbershops, nail salons, etc to open.

A vast majority of them said ""nah thanks"" and are still closed. Every single restaurant around me turned down the offer and are still curbside only. 

And this is a very red state.

The bottom line is that most businesses aren't closed because they are being forced to. Most businesses are closed because the owners/workers don't want to work around crowds in a pandemic. It's that simple. The protestors and ""you're a dOoMer"" people are a vocal minority. 

If this is true in GA, it's definitely true everywhere else.

What a lot of these people seemingly don't realize is that with 60k+ Americans dead, *a lot* of people have family/friends who sadly passed away with COVID-19. These people aren't going to get pumped about going back to work just because Elon Musk talks about ""freedom."" These people are exercising their freedom by staying the fuck home, by choice. 

It doesn't matter what the government does. People aren't going to go back to life as normal until they feel it's safe. Bottom line."

[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19) 

A small benefit from the drug, but it seems that the majority of patients in the trial recover with or without remdesivir. Although some patients may benefit from the drug with faster recovery times, its not exactly a cure. But you know that this drug is going to get pumped so hard that its price will go negative (think oil) /s. 

Patients will, however, go nuts demanding this drug and GILD is going to charge a ton for it. Then news will leak about the crazy price GILD is charging for it and get sued or people will die even though they're on the drug and GILD will get sued because they rushed the trials. 

Overall, I think to sell the hype because the effects don't seem that amazing, and GILD will just about do anything to sell this drug since it failed against Ebola (got to make their money back from the R&D)."

If we get a second wave in Q3/4, will he just print another $5T? $10T?

If the *nominal* value of the SP500 is threatened, will they just put in enough money so that the dollar value stays the same, although the purchasing power is eroded through inflation?

If you actually read through the remdesivir study, they only tried it on 397 patients which is a very small group. Only patients who were hospitalized, but not on a ventilator, were selected. In the control group (didn't get the drug) the average recovery time was 15 days. With the drug, it was 11 days. The chance of a patient dying in the placebo group was 11.6%, while those who got the drug had an 8% chance of dying. The drug also creates liver problems of its own, and 3% of patients had to be taken off the drug early to avoid liver failure.  


When you factor in the small sample size, the differences between remdesivir and a placebo are not statistically significant. But I can guarantee you that the drug will get FDA approved anyway, and that it will be hella expensive despite its very limited usefulness."

Rule no. 1, dont all in and lock in gains quickly on the drop. Rule no. 2, know a bubble when you see one. 

Look at the talk on this sub and investing app. Are people buying because fundamentals indicate good long term growth or are people buying because they think others will buy in tomorrow, raising price?

If it's the latter, people will bail just as quickly as they flocked for the same reason. No one will want to be the 'greater fool'. I was wrong in October and I was wrong a week ago. I hold my puts and I'm ready to pile on more. 

Dont forget, market rallied 5+% for a month after first rona case in US. And it was known how damaging it was to china economy.

Despite the widespread warnings, share prices have increased in recent weeks after steep declines earlier in the year. Those gains reflect the Fed's intervention, but not its forecast for the economy, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.

""[Mr Powell] provided a very sobering assessment of the economic impact, acknowledging that this will not just be a short, sharp shock, but a more prolonged event,"" she said. 

""With financial markets being backstopped by the Fed for the foreseeable future, they will likely continue to signal a narrative that is very detached from the Fed's own solemn economic assessment."""

2. April 6, sold my SPY puts at a moment of clarity with SPY at 255, bought SPY 265 4/9 for $2.50. Sold an hour later for like $2.70 and went back to puts because I wimped out. On April 9th SPY hit 281 and my position would have gone 10k -> 50k. 

Now down to 8k and literally don't know what to do. Sold my july puts today at noon for 75% losses.  Beyond FOMO at this point, more so just dazed at how fast the recovery happened. Idk what to even put that money into bc everything is so expensive now. Fuck.
