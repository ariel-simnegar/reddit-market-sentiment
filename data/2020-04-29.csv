The people we have elected into the most powerful positions in all the lands do not represent us, instead they take your money and find ways to funnel it to themselves and their friends without ever thinking about you.

Imagine you worked your whole life building your small business. You've got 20 employees that are like your family, half of them are your actual family. Corona hits and you're fucked, but Trump, the FED, and congress are going to save you with the PPP loans, hooray! Then you go to bank after bank and get turned away, the program has tons of problems, banks don't know how to handle it, you're bleeding money trying to save your employees. Then they announce the program is out of money, there's nothing left for you, they gave it all away to giant corporations."
