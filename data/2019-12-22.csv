Will pass along the pics to the other mods, who will greatly appreciate the pics.

Free flair and gold for the first few, and the first will also be included in the WSB awards.

Thank you for making my dreams come true.

edit: [Official WSB merch store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/officialwsb/).

Unfortunately the estimated shipping isn't until January, so I guess this only applies to those who have bought already"

2019-12-22 21:18:11,PM-ME-GOOD-DESIGN,2,I‚Äôm in DEEP on AMD calls for Friday... broke through pennant and hoping the move continues upwards. Heard everyone and their moms expecting a ‚Äúpullback‚Äù but uhhh could ya not do that? Ty. Market still looking pretty bullish. Hoping it can pass 44.50 & 45.10 since that seems to be where everyone is thinking it‚Äôs going to reverse.

2019-12-22 21:14:01,1sildurr,1,"Depends on the open. Hope to exit short premium positions in /ng and UNG.

Might buy to close a few strangles in different dumb stocks. Depends if their IVR gets under 20.

Otherwise, watching a few short puts in APA, CNP, etc.

Put on some Jan/Feb put calendar spreads in RUT and DIA on Friday. So either look to close those for 10ish% and reopen them in SPX depending on volatility, or will keep holding them and wait for some volatility to increase their value. 

Beyond all that, just look for opportunity. But with the VIX this low, I might need to start buying some put spreads or something. Not much action for theta gang."
