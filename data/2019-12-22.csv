Will pass along the pics to the other mods, who will greatly appreciate the pics.

Free flair and gold for the first few, and the first will also be included in the WSB awards.

Thank you for making my dreams come true.

edit: [Official WSB merch store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/officialwsb/).

Unfortunately the estimated shipping isn't until January, so I guess this only applies to those who have bought already"
