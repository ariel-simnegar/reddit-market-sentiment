Ad costs are cheaper then ever, but direct response marketers are seeing the benefit. 

Most big names love “branding”, which, although does produce profit it’s nearly impossible to measure ROI. 

Shit, facebook’s ad tracking makes it hard to measure ROI to begin with. 

But all of these big companies pulling out?

“We will be against racism for 1 month, then it’s back to profits”

So many businesses are shifting online, and guess how you fuel sales online?

Advertising. 

Facebook ads aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. It’s the “holy grail” for the marketing and MMO faggots (I’m one of them).

But...It would also be beautiful. I love this sub, I've posted more on this sub than any other. I've made memes, friends, made/LOST money and learned some very, very, valuable life lessons. Now is that what I'd call beautiful? Yes, but actually no.

What I really find beautiful is that all of the history hear will vanish, all will be forgotten, and the world will move on. Only through its user base will the memory of this sub live, people like me who've invested A LOT of time into this place, spending hours reading and creating content....

AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. NOT EVEN A FUCKING FLAIR!!! GIVE ME A FUCKING FLAIR ALREADY!!! CHRIST.

for bears, the unexplainable knot in your stomach that tells you market might open green even though it should open red according to all logic, 

for bulls, the haunting realization that buying calls during a pandemic and recession might be flying too close to the sun, but trusting the printer all the same

For theta gang, looking at rising VIX from the corner of your eyes, your usual serenity clouded with fleeting moments of panic, constantly reminding yourself 90% of options expire worthless even though you can’t shake off the feeling you might lose everything 

For Kang gang, desperately trying to clutch at any straw of a play in this chaotic market and trying to time the market, always dreading having to hold overnight"

Yes it exists to a certain extent but I think as a country the US probably does the best job in the world at including and providing opportunities to people of all backgrounds.

What really pisses me off is fucking holier than thou Europoors. In Europe racism is worse than the US. While generally speaking racism isn’t a big issue in their criminal justice system, it is insanely prevalent in their private and public institutions and as a result minorities and immigrants do not have access to nearly the same opportunities as the U.S.

Not to say we have solved the problem here by a long shot, just really fucking irks me when I hear these teenage edge-lords talking shit about the US like it hasn’t been the single greatest positive force that has helped drive humanity forward.

Asian markets are pricing in Europes Fridays movement, thus down biggly and are currently moving with US Futures


India down 1.16% 

Hang seng down 1.%

Nikkie down 2.33%


#_____________________



Europe indices are still testing their major support


Dax up 0.5%


CAC 40 down 0.02%


FTSE down 0.1%


#_____________________


Dow trading at 24994 being 0.17% up


Global markets are in general trading in the range determined by past week and are currently in the lower end of the range, frankly the are eye to eye with their support

#____________________


Trade setup for today


#300 and 295 are one of the major area to decide next trend, if this break next resistance is directly at 275, but I am personally bull this week cause 300 support is too strong and would not like to underestimate


If it somehow manages to respect the support we can see 314 as an immediate target, the risk reward seems favorable

We won't be keeping stop loss for stocks but recommend a strict stop loss of 295 on derivarives with a view to hold through the week



Long term : Nasdaq not respecting it's 10k psychological support is a big red flag, we are planning to invest small quantity in quality stocks on this dip but are refraining to go big 

We are relatively flat for past 2 months, it appears we have transitioned from explansionary market to contracting market 



If I be honest, I can see no bull case or bear case on the charts, we are just playing a gamble by going long just because we are at the lower end of the range we are trading, I said this to be as transparent as possible

She's an essential worker and has developed a real close relationship with her colleague Brad.  It's at the point where they text each other goodnight etc.  He picks her up in the morning and drops her off.  Sometimes they sit in the car for like 5 minutes at the front of our home.

The other night I decided I'd leave the garage door open and hide out behind some old furniture, just to see what they're up to.  They eventually pulled up and she didn't get out immediately.  I saw her lean over and as I adjusted my position I noticed some rust forming and what appeared to be a crack on the new squat rack I bought relatively recently (gym's closed etc).

Has anyone dealt with this?  There seems to be a bunch of videos online regarding surface rust removal but the crack has me worried."

Yum brand 8500 stores in China, BYND will be in 14 stores (3x Taco bell's for 8 days, 6x Pizza hut's for 4 days and 5x KFC's for 3 days)

BYND has had two trials with fast food restaurants (McDonalds and Tim Hortons) both have failed within a few months of trial.

Their sales are front loaded for these trials. Ooooo is that the BYND meat sub I have heard so much about at my local shitty fast food joint I eat at everyday? Sure I will give it a shot! Oh it tastes ok... but costs a little more. Would that person be buying that everyday? FUCK NO! Yet BYND claims a 46% retention rate for trial sales?!

There will be a nice headline coming out of this CHYNA expansion. Something along the lines of ""Yum China expanding trial with BYND to ping and pong locations"" and BYND tards will pump the shit out of the stock.

The expansion trial will fail in the coming months and tank the price. On the headline of Macdonalds not expanding their trials the price tanked 10%. Side note this was known information there was a question  asked in the earning QnA 2 months ago that CEO blew past covering this. 

TLDR - 11/20 BYND 150-170p depending on price pump in coming months"

They wacked TD that has around a million subscribers. They wouldn’t think twice about doing the same to us if we don’t fit their agenda. I truly hope that it doesn’t happen, but if it does we need form another discussion board on a different website. This is the only sub I come on Reddit for. Just please be aware of everything.

So Tesla reported earnings AH and rallies on the 29th. Gets called out on the 30th and dumps. Rallies to close 30th and dumps on the 1st after the tweet and madman stunt.

It's a tiny bit that's forgotten relating to that stunt but something to consider for TSLA earnings in July. Spoiler: probably pretty ugly without fudgery.

Issues rated below investment grade comprised 3.6% of the securities acquired.

So, 96.4% of the bonds the fed had to buy to backstop the market were ""investment grade"".

2020-06-29 02:36:23,kxtrader,8,"US domestic concentrated airlines are a good buy now (e.g., Spirit Airlines, Southwest, Jet Blue).  On all their last earnings calls in May, they universally projected about -90% of YoY traffic in June.. but if you look at each of their recent news updates, they've been all quickly opening flights back up due to ""unanticipated demand.""  Peeps will argue that states are closing up or that some are imposing quarantines from certain states.  Reality though is that closing is limited to specific establishments in states (e.g., bars) and that quarantines are not being enforced by any type of penalty.  Also remember that all of them received federal assistance through CAREs, so thy're getting almost free cash boost on top of unexpected regular revenue. Their earnings will be in a few weeks, so will be a good time to buy before IV starts to go up more.

example - link to Spirit Airlines Q1 presentation in May: https://s24.q4cdn.com/507316502/files/doc_presentations/2020/05/Investor-Presentation-05.19.2020.pdf

It could be perhaps, that his ass was too tight.

but still, word to the poor;

sell some OTM options after a big move. always. the standing vix in the 30's says 2% moves are expected. so if its up .5% sell calls expiring the next day another 3% up, or if its down, sell some puts again, more than 2 but less than 10 % out. 

SPY has options expiring every other day. literally. wait for a big tuesday dump, sell wicked OTM options to morons. it might keep going down, who knows, but it wont drop 10% in a day so go to town

basically, if you have 100 bucks you dont know what to do with, and its tuesday or thursday, sell OTM options, get a few extra bucks and see if anything else comes along. money sitting still does no one any good.

anyway, that aint my business, see you fucks in the funny pages."

2020-06-29 01:47:46,cryptwalkin,2,"Best trading strategy: 

1. post your trading ideas on WSB (for best results be very emotional involved with your ideas)  

2. Next morning look over them and find the ones that make the most logical sense and seem like 100% 🔒 can’t go tits up

3. Go onto Robinhood and do the exact opposite.

The best way to do this is to do #1 on Friday after closing and then doing #2 on Monday morning not giving yourself much time to overthink the strategy. 

Also, #1 works best when you are extremely passionate about your opinion the more certain you are the better it is to inverse. For instance if you can’t wait for Monday and it’s All you can think about during the weekend and you are shopping Zillow for the house your gonna buy go all in on the inverse 👍"

Either way, since you don't hear much about a 3rd wave or a never ending pamdemic, and you don't see 2nd wave action in NYC metro area, the buyers who missed out on the dip buying during the final weeks of the 1st wave are going to be anxious to get in now and not miss out on the emergence back to another ""reopening phase"" news cycle. 

I think if shit goes sideways in NYC, then $SPY will go down slow and steady until at least Fall before getting chance to start making its way back up to 320. 

But, if NYC stays on reopening schedule to phase 3, then I expect gap ups, followed by days of down trends, then repeat.  Unless Biden campaign somehow goes down hard, then mooning. If Trump campaign shits the bed in unrecoverable way, then drill team 6.

More testing is now available, so there appears to be a spike in numbers. The death rate appears consistent, and will probably drop in percentage as more people get tested. What is not being tracked are how many people got tested and were found negative, and how many that were infected recovered."

The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance - Carl

you're not wrong. cases are spiking, social unrest mooning, presidential retardation peaking, banks in shambles.

We are still bearish. We are.

*but*

you gotta stop thinking about the market as a daily thing. The big boys don't view the market in daily units, they zoom out and look at the big picture. Bad news and bad financials don't mean we will be red *tomorrow.* It just means we will be red over the next 3 months.

I am 100% still bearish and believe we will break 300 sooner rather than later. But the bottom line is that there will be a bounce after a -2.4% day.

I don't care how bearish you are, you shouldn't be buying puts at the end of a -2.4% selloff.

looks like a spinning top, no, a doji.. OH! bulls push ahead

bears right on their tails, still putting up one *helluva* fight!  

bulls ahead by. a. nose!

Larry, it doesn't get more exciting than this!

bulls ahead!  this is a long race, Larry, so an early lead doesn't mean much unless they pull ahead by a mile!  Don't forget, though, that bears have gravity on their side.. they always take the window down while those hard-fighing bulls have to grunt for every inch!

Bulls widening the lead now!  watch for what happens after the gap fill that we knew was coming.  if the bulls can break above that gap, they'll have a real advantage for the first leg of this race, until the Asians join."

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck r/investing and those 2% savings accounts. &nbsp; 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz.  &nbsp; Go for the millions.
