Ad costs are cheaper then ever, but direct response marketers are seeing the benefit. 

Most big names love “branding”, which, although does produce profit it’s nearly impossible to measure ROI. 

Shit, facebook’s ad tracking makes it hard to measure ROI to begin with. 

But all of these big companies pulling out?

“We will be against racism for 1 month, then it’s back to profits”

So many businesses are shifting online, and guess how you fuel sales online?

Advertising. 

Facebook ads aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. It’s the “holy grail” for the marketing and MMO faggots (I’m one of them).

But...It would also be beautiful. I love this sub, I've posted more on this sub than any other. I've made memes, friends, made/LOST money and learned some very, very, valuable life lessons. Now is that what I'd call beautiful? Yes, but actually no.

What I really find beautiful is that all of the history hear will vanish, all will be forgotten, and the world will move on. Only through its user base will the memory of this sub live, people like me who've invested A LOT of time into this place, spending hours reading and creating content....

AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. NOT EVEN A FUCKING FLAIR!!! GIVE ME A FUCKING FLAIR ALREADY!!! CHRIST.
