cocaine. staple of Wall Street. personally not a fan but you should at least be familiar with it so you can pretend like you're a professional. doesn't fucking last long enough for my tastes but it's ostensibly natural so maybe you might like it.

Adderall. new kid in town. for most of you this is the best choice especially if you can get a prescription. gives you the focus you need without overdoing it.

You idiots need to fucking relax and understand this.

The market is getting too good for its own good in the sense that if we rally too fast too soon it‚Äôs difficult to attract new longs above a certain value. But if it gaps down a little there will be more buyers that missed the rally wanting to get long at a lower price.

Liquidation breaks strengthen the market as it takes out the weak handed longs bringing in new buyers. Short covering rallies weakens the market as it takes out weak shorts and brings in new sellers.

Good luck ahead, don‚Äôt doubt your vibe.

It‚Äôs been real WSB. See you on the other side."

Bull God I am asking for more
  

Demanding of all tendies

To only become a degenerate gambler
Who asks for everything

2020-06-09 06:44:24,SolitaryEgg,21,"I know some people are going to just write me off as a dumb doomsday bear, and admittedly, I do have some bearish positions (but small ones because im scared). But I have a lot more in shares in my retirement, so I am bullish on the whole.

99% of the time I'm shitposting, but today was actually really odd, and it's worth mentioning.

There were two notable things about today:

1) VIX went up today, and even continued going up as SPY went up. This happens sometimes, but it's rare. VIX moves with SPY about 10% of the time, but it's really, really odd for both VIX and SPY to have fully green days on the same day. SPY finished at 1%+, and VIX finished at 5% green. five fucking percent. It's really, really weird.

2) Put/call ratio dropped to lowest in 5 years today. 

https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1270127003094732801

If you're too retarded to know that the big players use options as hedges, this at least suggests that a lot of huge players just went short on the market, today.

We all know the big institutions have been sitting back and laughing, helping retail investors pump everything up, waiting to transfer an impossible amount of wealth from the middle class to the 1%. 

It does make me wonder if the reckoning is here. But who the fuck knows."

Do you think there will be a major drop after we hit pre-COVID highs? Think again. For the last three months, the American economy has shown resilience to a level no one could even conceive of in March. Think about how few bankruptcies we've actually seen. Consider that the handful of companies that did become insolvent did so because they were already weak and near death (think JC Penny). Their individual ""deaths"" actually make the whole stronger. Their customers are now shopping with better companies, who can now grow even more.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and what doesn't destroy the economy takes it to all-new-heights. We as a country, and as an economy, spent March and April running a marathon every day. Now that we survived it, we are stronger and more agile. Will there be another dip in the next few weeks? Sure, almost certainly. Can you time it? No. Can you ride through it and come out a winner? I would take that bet."

2020-06-09 06:10:28,d10srespect,2,"Last week I was contemplating between 5 stocks to swing trade: BA, DIS, NKLA (VTIQ then), DKNG, and MGM. In the end it came down to DKNG and VTIQ. Now mind you, I had just regained freedom after I got out of my 1500 share position in BA at 143 on 5/22, which I had for about a month. I got out at even money because at the time BA was teetering around 120-140ish. Anyway, with that in mind I was hesitant about NKLA because of the fear that while I liked the company and had a good feeling it would gap up, I wasn't 100% sure. So with precaution, I went with what I thought was the safer pick in DKNG. I know I bought in at a high price, $42 and 5000 shares, but I felt it had a good shot to go up to 50 by eow. The rest is history. In the end, all the money that I spent on DKNG would've gone to NKLA had I just decided to invest in them instead. Needless to say, I am distraught and feeling immense guilt. Out of the 5 stocks I had in mind, 4 went way up and I picked the one that went down. Pretty much sums up about all my trades."

Let‚Äôs say you buy calls, J pow is pumping into your Spy after hours and that‚Äôs what we call the pump. Your calls get a really tight feeling like your account is going to explode any minute and it‚Äôs really tight and it‚Äôs like someone is pumping air into your ETFS and it‚Äôs just blows up and it feels different, it feels fantastic. It‚Äôs as satisfying to me as cumming is, you know having sex with my wife‚Äôs boyfriend and cumming. So can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like getting the feeling of cumming during market hours, I am getting the feeling of cumming on the weekend, I am getting the feeling of cumming during a Trump speech, when I pump up, when I post my gains in front of 5000 people I get the same feeling so I am cumming day and night. It‚Äôs terrific right? So I am in heaven."

2020-06-09 05:42:01,CyanideMuffins,5,"I feel like you can't really judge NKLA based on fundamentals. Objectively, VTIQ/NKLA has always been largely speculative, but it seems like there's a growing perception that the speculation is becoming more concrete, regardless of whether or not that is actually true. I think part of that has to do with IVECO buying out 7% of shares today. I think another part of it has to do with NKLA breaking from the pump and dump pattern it's been trapped in for the past few months. Anyone who's played NKLA in the past when the ticker was VTIQ was understandably wary of rapid price surges because historically, it dumped as hard as it pumped, almost immediately. Today, NKLA defied that pattern by continuing to pump the entire day following the trading halt and even into after hours. There will definitely be a dump, and it's going to be absolutely brutal. But I feel less certain that it will happen tomorrow or even the day after. I think there's enough hype to carry this short-term pump a bit longer, even if there's a sizeable sell-off tomorrow morning because 1) the FOMO is realer than it's ever been and 2) people seem to feel more secure in holding their shares long term. I'm still hesitant to buy in, but I wouldn't be surprised to see NKLA drop back down to 70/80 and rally past 100 this week."

Previous baselines are not retained like a normal stock that would just be building up to a prior market cap. At the end of each day, the baseline resets. These are not intended to be used for anything other than short term, swing trades and hedges. For example, it‚Äôs possible for the underlying assets to increase in value (over a quarter for example) and the leveraged ETF to decrease over that same period.

Basically all the companies on [this map](http://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/drilling/operators/) plus a few others have been pumped above even their February highs. Back in 2016 the likes of SWN and RRC were trading at 20-60 and now in the <10 range, but still higher than February.

2020-06-09 03:33:06,thisisbsol,6,"SPYV calls are probably smarter than SPY right now tbh. SPYV is the S&P500 value ETF and its down 9.6% since late February compared to the growth ETF, SPYG. A lot of investors sold their stakes in low beta safe stocks like WMT and KO simply to put that money into stocks that were hit harder thus expected to recover more. Now that those stocks are fully recovered after a little help from our lord and savior JPOW,  investors that gained all their money back from the crash are gonna sell and buy back into their pre-COVID value stock positions and more likely than not will buy even more until they can be more certain about a full recovery and beyond. 

Only downside is volume but calls are cheap and the ITM calls have alot of OI too. The volume for 6/19 calls isnt bad though and the bid ask isnt that wide on most. If you're a bull expecting a full recovery soon then the worst case scenario is you sell at the bid for a couple dollars less.

On a certain occasion, it was predicted that the season's olive harvest would be larger than usual, and during the off-season, he acquired the right to use a number of olive presses the following spring. When spring came and the olive harvest was larger than expected he exercised his options and then rented the presses out at a much higher price than he paid for his 'option'."

I have a feeling it might get some traction."
2020-06-09 03:06:16,SunriseSurprise,13,"Something to bear in mind lingering bears out there - you have to think of the market in terms of absolute value, not just USD. If you look at USD vs. other currencies lately, it's losing a lot of ground. There was a lot of market gain since the crash that did NOT see USD losing ground - only really recently did it start to, which is actually normally what happens when the market goes up. Anyways, it's worth keeping in mind because if you were to say look at SPY in CAD, it's not necessarily been going up a lot in recent weeks. It's not apparent because we only ever look at SPY in USD, but with both SPY going up and USD going down, the market isn't REALLY going up a lot lately.

What's the point? Well it could very well break through ATHs and leave you wondering WTF while at that point, USD might also start breaking under where it was vs. other currencies pre-covid, so the market isn't REALLY above where it was before if you look at it that way.

The other thing to consider is that while SPY is closing back in on ATH, a lot of stocks have already surpassed their ATHs while others like airlines, cruises, retailers, restaurants, banks, etc. still have quite a ways to go. It's unlikely the tech stocks in particular will relinquish those ATHs, so it's quite possible SPY will break through ATH like it's nothing just because those industries are continuing their recovery to pre-covid levels.

Just a warning so you don't throw everything you've got at SPY puts once it starts reaching those ATH levels again, as you may end up sorely disappointed."

As if a bunch of inexperienced idiots drunk on ""sure-thing"" gains are being led into the dark scary woods to be slaughtered. If/when the bottom does fall out of this market, all that smart money will be ready to swoop in a buy everything at insane cheap prices. It also explains why the volume has slowly been declining for weeks.  Like, It's fun for boomers to watch CNBC in the morning making fat stacks on airlines stocks, thinking they're smarter than Warren Buffet but guess who's gonna be buying if we leg down. It also aligns perfactly with platforms like Robinhood being created and the rest following suit with commission free trading. Just lure all the rubes in and then fuck them till their dead."

Only downside is that I will have to stop smoking buds for a few weeks until I pass a background check/urinary analysis and get settled into the position  haha.

I also got into some SPY calls this morning that I sold later this afternoon for \~25% profit and then I picked up more SPY calls around closing bell that I am currently holding. $325 contracts for this Friday. Hoping Tomorrow is not the RuG pUlL.

REITs still have some room to climb to get back to normal levels, have historically performed on par or better with the SP, and the tax advantaged account is ideal for REITs which are obligated to pay out 90% of income.

I‚Äôm üåàüêª but at heart i‚Äôm all about tendies and the 500% to 1000% gains! 

We don‚Äôt care about that banker 5% to 20% ish they can go fuck themselves in their tercel!! 

Yes I joined bull army to ride this wave created by the FED... XFL 30 sept call for .38... 

But honestly... you guys truly believe spy will hit 350 or even higher?? 

Why i‚Äôm written this post is to unify all the tendies maker so that we position correctly for the correction .... there will be one!! Might be only to 290, to 280? 250? 200?? Who knows?? 

But trying to make a post to get us all together to not miss that leg down and make massive tendies out of it!!! 

Post your suggestions!! At when and what lvl and what to buy...

TL;DR we might break ATH on SPY but I still believe in a fierce correction into fall/election time... still believe in a re test of the low abd even 200 SPY! 

I want to ride both ways

Drink some $PBR with me tomorrow

Petrobras is an offshore drilling company in Brazil.  Not just an offshore, THE offshore leader in Brazil.  They‚Äôre one of the ‚Äú new Seven Sisters‚Äù in fact

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters_(oil_companies)

They are world leaders in their deep water drilling and own some of the deepest rigs out there.

They are breaking fuel export records

https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2112440-petrobras-hits-new-fuel-oil-export-record?amp=1

And they are set to benefit from the explosion of the Brazilian aviation stocks that mooned today and Friday. 

I think they could be set to do what Valaris did today

$PBR 19.5 c 6/19
 
Let‚Äôs drink some PBR boys"
2020-06-08 23:55:19,,6,I can‚Äôt be the only one to want a massive red day to get an entry point into some nice calls
2020-06-08 23:55:11,FourOranges,19,"Writing this while holding back tears, here goes...

I'm an average Joe and I managed to build an investment portfolio of 80k in the last 5 years. I learned to invest from reading and practicing and I started out slowly, made my mistakes and learned along the way.

I turned 20k into 80k in the last 4 years using a few different strategies. I bought smartly, and short sold when something was too high. I've been careful and smart about it and everything went well until two weeks ago...

 The fact that a multi billion dollar company that I follow (TSLA) can completely brush off this insane coronavirus endeaver and head back towards ATH tells me that the market is honestly bs and irrational. Completely Irrational at times.

Needless to say I'm heart broken and going through 'some things'. I make a slightly above average salary, and I worked hard to save up and put time and effort into increasing that portfolio over the years.

I'm at a point now where I don't know what to do. I'm in my 30's, and had been hoping to increase that portfolio a little more so I could buy a home and start a family with my wife. I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me and I'm ashamed of my mistake and fighting feelings of hopelessness and depression. My wife is loving and supportive and isn't holding anything against me. She knows what happened was an unlikely outcome and was not intentional.

I've been knocked on my butt a few times before in life whether with career, relationships, or even money, and I've always managed to learn and get back on my feet. Today I just feel old and tired. I had so many hopes and dreams and was finally getting close to them, and now I have to start all over. My 2 week puts that I all inned on just went worthless today after this absolutely nonsense of a market price action.

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you handle losing everything and starting over?"

People are [panic buying a company](https://www.investing.com/equities/hertz-global-holdings-inc) that is most likely being delisted this week or next week. 

Make as much money as you can on calls. There's obviously a ton of money to be made in a bubble. But manage your exposure and take gains along the way, because when it pops, it will happen just as fast or faster. You might even lose more money on the way down than your current exposure because you'll buy the dip too before you realize the party is over.

So don't miss out on these gains, but also don't mistake this for buying in at SPY 220 simply because we're climbing just as fast."

Many kept cash or bet against the market waiting for the crash that never came and missed the tech and streaming, which have now recovered. They now want to get back in the market and are buying whatever has not yet recovered and is still underpriced. Hence the buying of airlines, hotels, car rentals, etc.

As more get back into the market, the index funds get back to full recovery."

99% of the time I'm shitposting, but today was actually really odd, and it's worth mentioning.

There were two notable things about today:

1) VIX went up today, and even continued going up as SPY went up. This happens sometimes, but it's rare. VIX moves with SPY about 10% of the time, but it's really, really odd for both VIX and SPY to have fully green days on the same day. SPY finished at 1%+, and VIX finished at 5% green. five fucking percent. It's really, really weird.

2) Put/call ratio dropped to lowest in 5 years today. 

https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1270127003094732801

If you're too retarded to know that the big players use options as hedges, this at least *suggests* that a lot of huge players just went short on the market, today.

We all know the big institutions have been sitting back and laughing at the retail investors pumping everything up, waiting to transfer an impossible amount of wealth from the middle class to the 1%. 

It does make me wonder if the reckoning is here. But who the fuck knows."

The market makers who sold the calls had to buy stocks in the thin liquidity to cover their gamma exposure, creating a short squeeze on the hedge funds that went short. The rise in the vix is the market makers having to charge a higher price on option premiums to compensate their estimates losses on gamma hedging operations. What happens going forward is a pure function of how retarded you guys get. The more calls you retards buy, the higher the SPY goes up, creating a feedback loop.

If you have someone to reach out to, do it, for your own sake.

2020-06-08 21:03:50,Captain-Egg,1,My nclh puts I bought Friday 12.50 7-17 didn‚Äôt lose any value.......
2020-06-08 21:03:48,Random-Number1,2,"Negative press on oil, but all my calls are still up... We think the lower cap oil stonks gonna keep the gains coming tomorrow? Have CPE/QEP/VAL/NOG and today was a good day. Hoping BORR/CDEV/FET make a morning run, opened up positions late today--if the sector as a whole crashes then I'll probably just hold and wait for oil to get expensive again.

Interested to see how high IVR can go, teased $9 today, would love to see it break $10 this week. Pushing into a couple different REIT's alongside it (MFA, NRZ) 

Hopped off the SHIP today, feels undervalued but saw a LOT of volume to sell this morning while most of the drive up yesterday AH/this afternoon was on small orders. If you're long it's probably fine, but got seasick and took my \~30% gains today. 

Holding HEXO, looking for that 1.5 break for it to blast off, my calls are up more than my stock for this one, looking long I like it but waiting for some good press to boost it. 

I set a price alert on XSPA and I refuse to look at it until then, I see longterm value in it. Respect to any who bought under $1 and flipped, but thinking this one should scale and then moon in the coming months. Trust the process.

Waiting on NDRA, NBRV, EKSO, HOTH to pump up, but seems unlikely this week. Not stressed just gonna hold the bag until people come back to biotech. 

If we open strong I'll probably pull out fast AF and leave some tendies on the table to be safe, struggling to trust this rally but pumping all my unemployment money in anyways."

2020-06-08 21:03:40,masterlich,4,"Can someone figure out why this play isn't free money?

HTZ: 

Sell the $3 October put 17 for $2.05 credit (current bid price as of 3:58 PM)
Sell 10 $1/$2 October credit call spreads for $.98 each (I have already done this for 100 contracts, so I know it will get filled)

If the stock closes below .95 on October 17, you lose up to .95 on the put but you gain $9.8 from the calls (net positive).

If the stock closes between .95 and 1.98, you gain on the put and you gain on the calls (net positive).

If the stock closes between 1.98 and 3 you lose .2 on the calls but you gain 1.02 to 2.05 on the put (net positive).

If the stock closes above 3 you lose .2 on the calls but gain 2.05 on the put (net positive).

I can't think of a possibility where you lose money on this? I know there's no such thing as a free lunch, so how is this trade going to fuck me."
