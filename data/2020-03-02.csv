2020-03-09 00:43:26,lavagninogm,1,I'm betting on Boeing going up in the near future. People seem to forget that it is not just a commercial airplane producer. It is worth much more even completely discounting its 737 MAX operations.
2020-03-04 05:24:09,canadian2020,2,"Thought on tomorrow:

\> COVID-19 infection >=1000 by Sunday of this week in USA

\> US indices go down at least by another 5-10% by Friday. After the dead cat bounce of Monday.

\> COVID-19 Vaccine and ant-viral Makers. who meet with Trump and health officials yesterday, will go up 10-50% in the next 10 days. Like I stated few days ago $INO is already hovering +100% today. Check my old posts. I would see how it does in the pre-market hours on Wednesday. It might pump to mid-teens before tanking to around $4-6$ before the end of the week.

\> Yesterday I predicted 25-50 basis point cut and it was actually 50 basis points. This will do nothing. The market will continue to plunge.

\> I expect some action from the ""Plunge Protection Team""   when the market drops 30% from the recent peak. I expect this to happen sometime in the next 3 weeks. At that time they may stop all trading. Check what happened in 2008. It will repeat.

\> So for us autists more puts! and more tendies!

\>As usual do your research!"
