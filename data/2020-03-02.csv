2020-03-09 00:43:26,lavagninogm,1,I'm betting on Boeing going up in the near future. People seem to forget that it is not just a commercial airplane producer. It is worth much more even completely discounting its 737 MAX operations.
2020-03-04 05:24:09,canadian2020,2,"Thought on tomorrow:

\> COVID-19 infection >=1000 by Sunday of this week in USA

\> US indices go down at least by another 5-10% by Friday. After the dead cat bounce of Monday.

\> COVID-19 Vaccine and ant-viral Makers. who meet with Trump and health officials yesterday, will go up 10-50% in the next 10 days. Like I stated few days ago $INO is already hovering +100% today. Check my old posts. I would see how it does in the pre-market hours on Wednesday. It might pump to mid-teens before tanking to around $4-6$ before the end of the week.

\> Yesterday I predicted 25-50 basis point cut and it was actually 50 basis points. This will do nothing. The market will continue to plunge.

\> I expect some action from the ""Plunge Protection Team""   when the market drops 30% from the recent peak. I expect this to happen sometime in the next 3 weeks. At that time they may stop all trading. Check what happened in 2008. It will repeat.

\> So for us autists more puts! and more tendies!

\>As usual do your research!"

All these fundamental hedge fund managers are scams.  People here on WSB could do just as good of a job.  All they did was get lucky a few times (like what we do here with YOLOs) and then convince a bunch of boomers and pension funds that they were good and then milk all their money over the next 10 years through management fees and whatever profit they make, while never beating SPY.  Marketing is like their best tool not actual trading...now that we are featured in Bloomberg, maybe we should do that too.  The order of their luck is also important.  You gotta get lucky first, rather than the other way around."

I think the only play is short bank stocks. They lose in both cases. Now to find a community bank publicly traded in the Seattle area... I'm sure it will have a great options market with a 50% bid/ask spread, but hey, that 50% oom put probably trades for $0.05 a contract!"

2020-03-03 05:09:52,HeinekenCoC,0,I'm seriously considering buying long-dated short positions on overvalued stocks like Tesla and SPCE. Is this a good idea? This drop last week looked to me like a catalyst. I knew the stocks would rally so I purchased short-dated calls and profited but this seems like the beginning of something bigger. What do you guys think? The yield curve has been inverted for a year now and I think the bullish sentiment can only last so long. I'm a novice at this but I really feel that the hysteria and herd behavior that occurred last week is indicative of the lack of confidence in the valuations of these companies. Passive investing bubble is gonna burst soon. Thoughts?

\> COVID-19 Vaccine and ant-viral Makers. who meet with Trump and health officials today, will go up 10-50% in the next 10 days. I would closely follow $MRNA (10-30%), $INO (10-200%), $GSK (3-5%), $GILD (20-100%) )

\> I expect some action from the ""Plunge Protection Team"" when the market goes down 20-30% from the recent peak. I expect this to happen sometime in the next 3 weeks.

\>I expect the Feds to reduce interest rate by 25-50 basis points.

So what does this mean exactly? 

Well a rhino has one horn, but a bull has two.

So we can take the results from my experiment, double it, and realistically expect 18% additional growth in SPY this month. With today’s close of $309 that should get us to approximately $364 by the end of March.

I swear Trump used his FED outbursts when things are hitting the fan, and then takes all of the credit during huge bull run. 

We're going to plummet if Powell and the FED see the markets going up and say rate cuts aren't needed. 

And you know what? I'm almost thinking that big money on wallstreet is planning to dump right ahead of that decision. And then bump back up in a month when FED is forced to make a move, back to ATH's, etc. 

Which goes back to Powell and the FED. You could've just tuned out ""the noise"" from Trump. Instead, you follow the markets ups and downs like idiots because... (final point) you've realized that our entire economy is on the fucking brink and the stock market pumping is the only thing you actually can prevent from declining (at least in the short term)."

“It’s still pretty tough. I’m not saying this is the bounce that ends it all. I’m concerned how the market reacts” to future headlines, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone. “Someone asked me, was there a massive Fed injection around 2 p.m.?” he said. “Everyone does look for, did I miss a headline, did I miss something? Frankly it does feel like we continue to get whipped around. This is a difficult situation to think about.”"

[Investing.com](https://Investing.com) marks the percent change to when FUTURES CLOSE at 4:15 PM.

If you google ""SPY"" into Google, it will mark the percent change AH to 4 PM Equity Close.

Thus, you see a huge + number on [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) because there was a sharp drop in futures from 4 PM to 4:15 PM, when futures closed.

[Investing.com](https://Investing.com) will probably change it later (by a -0.75%ish adjustment) to make it reflect the 4 PM close rather than the 4:15 PM close, so when it does that, I don't want anyone saying ""wow why did futures tank -0.75%""

This happens all the time, this is why on the weekend, there was a 1.5% difference, and how that adjustment got added later on [Investing.com](https://Investing.com)

Or just use logic and look at the actual prices..not the percent change.

So are futures currently up a lot?  Yes, they are, to the 4:15 PM time, BUT NOT TO the 4:00 PM close because futures dropped a lot from 4:00 to 4:15.

Alright, no more posts about this after hours ""why are futures up a lot and SPY not up"" or ""wow futures are up a TON yayayayay"""

You're all probably STILL looking at that huge EOD run up in disbelief... did it really happen? I thought we had 6 COVID19 deaths today?! LOL. Sorry. This is where patience really pays off guys. Wait for the stampede back into the markets to subside before jumping! 

Anyways, I've delayed getting into SPY puts for 24 hours and will reenter tomorrow. Wouldn't be surprised to see SPX go over 3150 tomorrow at some point. Of course, we could potentially open under 3050 also. My short entry targets begin from 310-315 (2-3 weeks out). If we get to 320+, I would buy 2-3 months out. Fundamentally, I still see us going down before \~2-3 weeks max. 

Disclosure: Currently holding 3/20-1/21 GDXJ/SLV calls long term and 3/6 UVXY puts overnight to sell tomorrow. Not financial advice, I'm probably 100% wrong, trade according to your own personal risk tolerance, yada yada yada...

For one, their execution prices will probably always be worse than what I can get through an actual broker (I use eTrade). Two, the time to execute said orders is going to be a lot more streamlined for paid platforms. Lastly, worst case commissions really isn't too bad. 50 contracts would cost $25 (@ $0.50/contract) or $32.50 (@ $0.65/contract) out of a $5k-$15k bet... It's pretty negligible. 

That said, if you trade with any sort of volume, you get preferred pricing. On eTrade, I pay $0.15/contract and I can probably get them down to $0.10 if I really negotiate. Of course... if you only have $50... then I guess RH is for you."

2020-03-02 21:24:49,dkrich,1,So many people I follow for sentiment were confidently buying the dip every day for the past week and today many of those same people are warning that this is a bear market rally. Just way too many people expecting an impending rush lower to “retest the lows” for that to be likely IMO. I don’t think we are likely to see the highs made on Feb 19th for a while but quite a lot of people who didn’t predict this crash or operate in any rational way during it are now acting like market experts. I think we probably settle out in a range for a while but with the Fed as accommodative as they are the risk is probably to the upside now if anything. The way the market completely shrugged off that virus news that hit midday was telling IMO. I think last week that would’ve triggered a 500+ point decline as shaky as the market was. Today it caused like a 200 point decline that was reclaimed in 30 minutes and ended on a massive rally.

2020-03-02 21:10:16,knotswag,12,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Looks like the signs of [buying on Friday I saw in the tech sector were indeed predictive of the overall market,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb1gsq/weekend_discussion_thread_february_28_march_1_2020/fj27aao/) and we took a nice healthy move upwards today, breaking the downward correction trendline I showed you in the last post. As I mentioned in that same last post, ~309.5 was the minimum target we hit before any further downside and we're pretty close to it. If you're playing AAPL like I was on Friday, we hit our first price target of 290. It's looking like it can hit 301-302, at which point I would play a bit more carefully and gauge the overall market thereafter. The resistance after that is 311, and it would fill it quite quickly according to crayons, so I think it's a momentum trade.

Support for SPY tomorrow is 304.7. So if we hit that tomorrow because of some overzealous buying to close today, but show strength at that level/reverse, I think it's a bullish sign that the buyers are indeed returning. We have plenty of resistances past 309.5, even though that was my cautionary target. So if you want to hold onto your calls, play attention to resistances at 311.5 and about 314.6. 

VIX broke below its current upward trend. When it starts nearing the 25-26 range and we don't see any meaningful action before then, I would be a bit more cautious with my holdings.

That's all. Good luck to everyone and keep collecting tendies."
