That's how we'll save our economies, I hope. 

And with the way everything is rallying with big ass moves to the upside, it seems coronavirus is great for the economy because its killed off small businesses that are not able to compete with the big boys who can raise the capital to sustain their business. These stock prices just can't keep up with demand. Jerome is making us all millionaires at this rate."

But keep this in mind when YOLOing: even in casinos, rarely do retards win money. It's still the people who are smart enough to identify which games are not (as) stacked against them, take in dealer/player information to shift odds 1-2% in their favor, and only put their money in the center when the odds are significantly in their favor based on statistical probability.

Point is: 1) Make sure you're playing at the right table/within your bankroll. If you entire savings are invested, you're not going to act rationally and be able to ride out the tough times. 2) Even if you're YOLOing, do REAL research into companies and have a REAL reason you believe its going up or down. Just because you end up correct, ""The chart is mooning"" and ""Printer go brrr"" are not real reasons and will ultimately give you false confidence."

Buy another 200 shares KODK, wait until the next run up to $10 ish, sell another 2 $7.5CC for about $600-$700 premium (already have 400 with $6.04 average, so my average cost would be $6.46, if I bought at current $7.31).

Would be solid if I could time the dip and grab 200 more at sub $7, then wait for the day it runs to $10-$12 then either sell the shares freely or throw out more 1/15 or 4/16 $7.5CC.

I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left. 

I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away as I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. Maybe it's in heaven, or some other ethereal place. I don't believe, but pretending that I do makes me feel alive again, if only for one fleeting moment. 

I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. For a moment, I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check the S&P futures. 3536. It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. 

Sitting in the empty, dusty room, I let out a broken whimper: ""futures flat... and gay."""

This is my first reddit account and I will humbly admit that I thought all the users were complete degenerates yet I have never felt so at home as when I'm browsing the content created by you high-quality retards who function well enough to actually make tendies. I don't even mess with tendies and some verbiage is beyond me yet a deep dive into /VX trading has showed me that my autism is incurable and stonks are life. Grateful to have 'options' in life and in the form of putting my lifesavings (a true credit in accounting terms) into FDs and selling for gains at the strike price or magic limit order numbers that are agreed upon in advance. Is this where I post my positions so that I can reference it and show the severity of my autist'm ? One month of reddit lurking and then my posts shall be visible, forward\_slash\_automod.

He was sitting with the couple in a table next to me and he was telling them about badger truck and all its features. Face id entry, full self driving, 0-60 in 2s etc. After an hour of praising himself and the truck he asked the couple if they wanted to see it.

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

2020-09-02 02:48:42,infinitelimits00,32,"So speculation is that some options firm may have blown up on ZM. Most MM were selling ZM calls and a few mighta sold one too many. That's why ZM had that weird AH action where it went up 10%, then stopped, then another 10%, then stopped, and then next day PM up another 10%. It was most likely option MMs having to buy shares to cover their short calls as gamma accelerated. It's basically what happens in Tesla every few weeks but in 1 night. 

So now it seems like a lot of MM are just holding the bag long a lot of these tech names. It's not like people are actually buying shares at these levels. This could make for a massive crash actually in these names. If one misses earnings, the entire stay at home tech sector can tank 30%. That's why the IV in names like DOCU are right now literally off the charts. But then again I don't know for sure, so yolo I guess."

2020-09-01 21:15:44,noentic,18,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 1st, 2020

Daily Synopsis

* The S&P 500 (+0.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) rallied to fresh record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq getting an added boost from the momentum in the mega-caps and growth stocks. The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.
* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.
* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.
* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.
* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.
* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.
* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.

Tesla's profitability has mostly been derived from the sale of Automotive Regulatory Credits, which is the sale of credits to other automakers who are not in compliance with state or federal requirements for zero emission vehicle sales. 

The regulatory credit sales translate into direct profits for Tesla, as there are no costs related to them. So while the company has been profitable more recently, it hasn't been driven by its underlying business of producing and selling electric vehicles.

""This puts the S&P committee in charge of adding names to the 500 in a real bind, because while to the letter of their 'law' Tesla qualifies for inclusion this is purely due to regulatory arbitrage,"" Colas said, adding that ""even a modest downturn in demand"" could push Tesla ""into the red again."""

Even after significantly ramping up manufacturing over the past few months, they are struggling to keep up with demand. Every basic suburban white girl has been waiting by the front door for 4-8weeks for their bike to arrive so they can join their friends online. Products require a monthly subscription, and of course, their standalone app allows for users to subscribe without even owning a physical peloton product. Talk about sweet, sweet recurring revenue, allowing PTON to be viewed in a similar light as technology companies like NFLX, ZM, etc.

All of this demand comes before Peloton has launched their ""cheaper"" products to expand beyond the high-end market.

I think we‚Äôre going to see a wave of unionization inside of two years.

Particularly for Amazon LEAP call holders, I would be keeping an eye on this. 

It‚Äôs not just Amazon and other e-commerce though. I think we can expect unionization writ large. I think it would also probably be one of the most effective ways the Fed would get the inflation numbers that they‚Äôre looking for.
