2019-12-13 11:13:28,Boonboonspy,2,I actually think that the proposal brought to Trump has already been agreed by the Chinese side. There's literally nothing to lose for China in this deal. It's a deal that everyone is slightly happier. I see a 50% roll back on existing tariff to keep China on bay for phase 2. Unless Trump has further requests which seems unlikely for now.

2019-12-13 01:56:09,knotswag,11,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

We had solid price action upwards today. [Haven't broken resistance (blue line)--fell just short of properly challenging it--](https://imgur.com/xH7SPeB) but we're still close enough to neutral in a lot of metrics for there to be ample room up. Futures buying action in NQ and ES both look really strong right now, with good volume, so I do expect us to push up there. Tomorrow's resistance is 319, almost on the button, so watch that price point. If we break it (i.e. gap up in the morning) watch for it to be new short-term support.

Should bears jump off a bridge yet? Not yet, only because bearish divergences haven't been fully broken so a bigger drop isn't totally off the table. But the amount of downside profit is not looking great. 315.7 is support for now, so yolo'ing on a FD too far past that is asking for trouble (or hail mary tendies). We do still have that big gap to fill down below to 312.5ish, so if 315.7 is taken out with good volume that would be the price point I would lock in some profits, but I imagine the only thing that would do that would be some sort of refutation of trade deal.

Anyway, not much else to report. Good luck tomorrow and let's all laugh at Britain in the meantime and count our delicious American tendies."

I do want to point out that we have been this close to a trade deal before, only for it to fall apart at the last minute. In May, the U.S. side had legally written up a deal, it had Trump's approval, and the Chinese had indicated they were ready to sign it. Then the Chinese side substantially rewrote the draft agreement to omit any language that forced China to change its laws. The entire deal fell apart and more tariffs were added soon after. Maybe we have finally broken out of the cycle, we'll see."

* COST  1Q TOTAL CO. COMP SALES INCL GAS, FX +4.3%, EST. +4.2%
* COST 1Q E-Commerce Comparable Sales Up 5.5% YoY
