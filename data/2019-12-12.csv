2019-12-13 11:13:28,Boonboonspy,2,I actually think that the proposal brought to Trump has already been agreed by the Chinese side. There's literally nothing to lose for China in this deal. It's a deal that everyone is slightly happier. I see a 50% roll back on existing tariff to keep China on bay for phase 2. Unless Trump has further requests which seems unlikely for now.

2019-12-13 05:21:10,,6,"prediction: trump will continue to pump markets during market open. and keep pumping through the day until spy hits 320. There will be a slight selloff during EOD cause no one wants to hold shit over the weekend, but most stocks will be up and spy will be at ~320 or so. then either friday after market close, or possibly saturday morning, trump will tweet some bad news or something, saying china didnt want to make the deal or china is asshoe. the market cant react to it cause market is closed for the weekend, surprisingly. then on monday, we dip to 316 before not QE kicks in. markets will trade flat until end of year, or will continue to rise as trade talks with china are going well"
2019-12-13 05:19:45,gbplfnt,5,what fucking makes me mental is that if I cut my losses with vixy a month ago and bought a bunch of calls on spy I would make up for all my losses. But in reality I have small balls to realize huge losses
