[Story came out this weekend](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/01/18/staff-emails-claim-boeing-777x-shares-max-problem/) that their new 777x ended up with much of the same lunkhead suppliers and retard cost-cutting measures the the 737max had. Doubt the story itself tanks the stonk because nobody has suffered a fiery death in 777x yet. But there are roughly 300 orders for this thing and a delay in production would probably make for some decent red candles. But you'd be a retard not to buy the BA dip.

In addition to the beauty that is Big Beautiful Woman, BBW is also Build a Bear Workshop. In the last week [since announcing a Baby Yoda doll](https://www.businessinsider.com/build-a-bear-baby-yoda-stuffed-animal-2020-1) their shares have gone up 55% on 20x times their normal volume. Not even Baby Yoda can save dying retail. Here's where it gets good. It is likly they [would not be ready until April 3rd.](https://moneywise.com/a/build-a-bear-to-let-you-build-a-baby-yoda), but earnings are on March 12th. 


Here's the play. Short BBW until March 12th, buy the dip. Then play the long game for  Q2s earnings for sweet double gains."
