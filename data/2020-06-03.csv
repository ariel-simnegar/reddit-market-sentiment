Hold at open. The market is going to pump in the morning to give the oversold RSI a break and when a reversal happens, buy some more puts and sell them all EOD.

fed balance sheet only going up 50B/week instead of 200B/wk: 2020-05-27: 7,097,316 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

dix is down below 45%: https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix

put/call ratio has dropped to 1.08, the lowest YTD, making this a profitable time for MMs to drop the price: https://ycharts.com/indicators/cboe_spx_put_call_ratio

VXX is down to lowest since March, which makes it more profitable to be a bear (bear bait!): https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VXX

Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio is the highest it's ever been, exceeding even 2001: https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1268109642791616513
