Hold at open. The market is going to pump in the morning to give the oversold RSI a break and when a reversal happens, buy some more puts and sell them all EOD.

fed balance sheet only going up 50B/week instead of 200B/wk: 2020-05-27: 7,097,316 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

dix is down below 45%: https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix

put/call ratio has dropped to 1.08, the lowest YTD, making this a profitable time for MMs to drop the price: https://ycharts.com/indicators/cboe_spx_put_call_ratio

VXX is down to lowest since March, which makes it more profitable to be a bear (bear bait!): https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VXX

Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio is the highest it's ever been, exceeding even 2001: https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1268109642791616513

They're presenting at upcoming investor conferences: 

* Stifel Virtual Cross Sector Insight Conference on **Tuesday, June 9, 2020** at 11:20 a.m. ET (10:20 a.m. CT).
* William Blair 40th Annual Growth Stock Conference on **Wednesday, June 10, 2020** at 8:00 a.m. CT (9:00 a.m. ET).

&#x200B;

Don't really know what they'll present but maybe it'll result in another pop? 

Might throw some money at $35c 6/19.

Once it hits a 30% gain (if it even begins to show signs of dipping I pull out) I set a stop price order to ensure that if it dips later on it will sell at 30% (I am an electrician and can’t be on my phone a lot) 

So for instance today I played APPS $7.5c 6/19. Bought at $.75 and sold $1.40. All within 20min after open

Played the same with BIDU a few weeks ago

LONG COMPLETELY UNRELATED POST BELOW 

If you’re still reading this I’d like your thoughts on my current life situation. I (probably mistakenly) trust you faggots for life advice. So basically, I just graduated college with a bachelors in business administration. My family in Texas told me if I was interested in moving over there, that they would have a good job in construction  lined up for me, guaranteed. It’s my uncle’s best friends’ company. I’m currently working at my family’s business and we’re growing YOY since we started around 4 years ago. I was due to get a big raise basically doubling my salary when I graduated this semester. I currently make around 33k a year. If I were to move to Austin I’d probably piss off my dad who expects me to help him keep growing the business. But to be honest I’m just tired of working in this business. I want to branch out and move somewhere else where I won’t be complacent with my life because I’m too comfortable. Would you guys risk losing out on an extremely stable job in a profitable family business in favor of going on an adventure in another city for who knows how long?


Edit: bro I really appreciate you guys sharing what you think. Got a lot to think about ahead. Thank you"

As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.

You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.

As you lay your cash down and load up on puts you give Big Jay a wink. ""Red"".

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, (previous thread) and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

People from all walks of Simpson Nation have banded together to fight a common enemy: lack of understanding about Simpson. People wonder, “The show I’ve treasured, known and love, for years and years, is not what it seems to be... not after this new information has come to light..”

People are righteously angry. They want the truth. Some have even gone as far as to inflict violence on others, as Nelson has done to Milhouse, on numerous occasions throughout the show. Some people, convinced certain buildings contain clues to the mystery of Simpson, have begun breaking into these places and destroying them if they lack evidence.

While I do not condone riots and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can’t even keep count. 
EXAMPLE

2020-06-04 02:19:03,Safina_,14,"The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset. One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#)

New cases are on the decline over the last week. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html

An increase as we approach the close of this week could indicate an uptick from the riots that would continue to grow into the middle of next week as riot crowds grew and spread across hundreds of cities since the 25-May killing of Floyd. 

If we see an increasing trend of cases, it may be a strong signal to what may be an explosive second wave of infections. More importantly, if there's a weak correlation of new cases after these massive, widespread crowds ignored social distancing protocol, then we have a large natural experiment showing that COVID-19, for the time being, is on its way out and that a bullish re-opening is on its way.

Watching this data closely for the next few days and place your sentiment accordingly."

Do just enough work to get by and the key is to respond to your emails fast, like really fast. Nobody likes that person who claims to have 5,000 emails and takes 3 weeks to respond, clean that inbox out on the daily even if you have no idea what’s going on. Do just enough work to out perform the guy doing the least amount of work, or you’ll get more work, and by more I mean everyone will dump their work on you so they have no work. 

If you follow this simple advice, you’ll climb the corporate ladder and make it to the top"

Should I “hold thru earnings?”

And what’s “Sell the fucking news?”


So gather close,

With your tendie greed

And I’ll tell you, my newbie chum.


These are the ways that Wall Street bets

Ends up fucking your fucking mum.


Don’t hold thru earnings,

Not right now.

When hype is the game we play.


The run up is the thing me boy.

The “maybes, ifs, and mays”

And once those quantities are known.

We run the fuck away.


What’s “IV crush?”

I hear you ask?

I’ll tell you stout and true.

IV crush is what happens when

You get fucked by theta crew.

Of these vulture dicks.

Where they hide is plain to see.

In stagnant stocks.

And calls pushed aloft

By the winds of greedy glee.

So you called a repair man. JPOW gets to work and diagnoses the problem as a lack of water pressure. You wonder what the hell water has to do with your heat. He says he can fix it for you so you don’t have to wait for the right guy. You agree and let JPOW get back to work. Later on you check on his work and you notice the basement is now full of water and now there’s a canoe down there. You find a note taped to the heater that reads “Sorry, couldn’t fix the heat but here’s a canoe to keep your stuff dry.”"

2020-06-03 22:51:08,BlowDaTrumpet,16,"USA coronavirus infections and deaths will rise massively next two months and the whole summer and obviously increase in the winter too. This isn't priced in. They didn't expect summer deaths to rise because they didn't expect all these people to go to protests, beaches and parks and disobey the curfews and social distancing.

US coronavirus deaths will be around 350,000-400,000 by the time of the election. It's officially 109,000 now but the real number is around 170,000 because of people who died at home.

Voting will be very difficult. It's going to be chaotic arguments about mail in voting and poll station voting.

The arguments will cause more chaos.

The banks and hedge funds who are predicting another crash and major correction are right.

The market has just been pumping on overhyped vaccine news and overhyped reopening news. The bigger wave of coronavirus is approaching because people have no discipline.

It's going to be a big lesson. Trump will go mad and cause chaos with his stupid mad tweets.

And all the above will be enough distraction for China to grab Taiwan."

Dunno how anyone can possibly believe consumers will be back to spending as much as before, so I can only assume the printer meme is literally holding everything up.

2020-06-03 22:31:10,PlasticRice,103,"The year is 2025. Coronavirus has no possible vaccine, as its rampant mutations outlast every world government's ability to solve the previous strain. COVID has mutated to the point where it is spreadable through eye contact and recontractible by sniffing the air of an infected patient within a 5 mile radius.

All school is online. Online universities such as Liberty University have went from being Ponzi Schemes to more difficult to get into than Harvard.

Indices are still green. Jerome has added 'Federal Printer Ink' to the federal balance sheet, taking up 98% of U.S. GDP to keep investors happy. $SPY is now at 4,269. 

**""any second now,"" the last bear said. ""There's no way we go past $4,500, right? I've drawn all the lines, read all the DD on Grindr. I'm going to buy even more puts,"" he said, as he ate spam and chicken noodle soup for dinner for the fourth year in a row.**

$ZM is now worth more than all three ETFs combined. Zoom has taken over the world, any and all actions are recorded and logged into Zoom's permanent databank of Human Beings. From birth, people are assigned numbers with associating letters -- akin to a social security number, except branded onto their foreheads, which allows them to log into Zoom for anything and everything: going to work, using vending machines, or even permission to sleep.

I check my RobinHood. It has been awhile since I've invested. I've spent the last five years in a bunker, waiting for the next dip to buy into. My portfolio, worth a few thousand dollars, should be worth about the same amount, right?

I check investing.com to gauge the value of the dollar. It can't be. What a penny was worth in 2020 is now worth millions. People no longer pay for groceries with actual amounts; instead, they weigh the amount of money necessary to buy products. I immediately try and see the price of a hamburger. 30 pounds of dollars, they say.

I go back into my bunker. I weep, gently, the door closing in front of me. My glorified gambling career is over. I log into my laptop, and now have to change ""Amateur Investor"" on my resume to ""Failed Doomer.""

It is the end."

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, (previous thread) and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

People from all walks of Simpson Nation have banded together to fight a common enemy: lack of understanding about Simpson. People wonder, “The show I’ve treasured, known and love, for years and years, is not what it seems to be... not after this new information has come to light..”

People are righteously angry. They want the truth. Some have even gone as far as to inflict violence on others, as Nelson has done to Milhouse, on numerous occasions throughout the show. Some people, convinced certain buildings contain clues to the mystery of Simpson, have begun breaking into these places and destroying them if they lack evidence.

While I do not condone riots and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.

We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......

Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....

Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can’t even keep count. 
EXAMPLE

I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.

Let’s make a change in Simpson.....

Like yeah, making a fat options play is awesome. But, damn, when you find these FOMO meme stocks and buy like $10k worth of shares and sell them 5 hours later for $15k, it's so fucking satisfying. Because

A) It's your retirement, so it feels more important somehow

B) It's tax-free

C) You're limited to $6k/yr in IRA contributions, so when you make $6k in a day, you feel like you warped your entire retirement account a year ahead.

I rode the airline rally, I rode the AVIS rally, today I rode the SAVA and WMG rallies... it honestly feels braindead and easy as fuck. Every morning there is some meme stock that blasts 50%+ in the first 3 hours of trading, and you don't even have to be smart and predict it. You can just buy-in in the middle and make fat stacks.

Ive literally doubled my entire retirement account this week. It's absurd.

The odds there's a second wave AND people change their behavior for it is zero.  Mark my words, people will mock you for wearing a mask in 2021.

Protests?  After 10 days, people will go home.  What percentage of people will actually put their money where their mouth is and put time and effort into communities that needs help?  Zero (okay, maybe 100 people in all of America).  Don't get me wrong, that cop deserves to go to hell but as for real change... LOL.  None of those people will follow through because they're too busy posting black squares on social media to do the hard work.  This is a non-issue for stock market purposes.

China canceled some purchases of American farm products, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing Chinese shipping officials.

""A handful of shipments of livestock feed, corn, pork, cotton, and some meat imports are pushed back,"" Chinese shipping executive said, adding that the move involved Chinese state-controlled companies, while private exporters are not part of it.

The cancellation of imports includes orders made after phase one of the trade pact between the two countries signed in January. Under the trade deal, China pledged to spend $200 billion more on US goods compared to 2017 levels and to import no less than $12.5 billion worth of agricultural goods in 2020 and $19.5 billion in 2021."

>Canaccord Genuity increases its price target on DraftKings (DKNG -1.8%) to $50 from $35.

>The firm expects the momentum to continue for DKNG even with shares up more than 200% since their public debut.

>""Our investor conversations suggest a focused interest to gain an early position on the only pure play in the burgeoning online sports betting market. Clearly, the valuation has expanded to a premium level and there is an immense amount of required execution ahead. However, we find that investors' willingness to consider upside scenarios has been bolstered by recent positive data points around platform engagement and the legalization progress, and we expect the return to sports this summer and fall to contribute to this enthusiasm."""

last year i had a lot of success swing trading TNDM leaps from 57 to 67 and back. Looks like it's set up to do something similar in the 78 to 88 range. Fundamentally, the company is good with a best-in-market product, expanding sales, and a couple promising new product lines to compete with PODD, the only other person in the wearable insulin pump market. 

if HEAR pulls back, will load more 17.5c leaps. With today's close, a number of technical indicators are now looking good on the daily. Refraining from giving guidance at their last earnings call merely postponed it's current move. Only good news ahead with the gaming consoles updates at the end of the year and a general video game/social distancing sales going through the roof.

Fully exited PS calls today. Rotation out of tech will slow it's rise even though I'm still confident in this particular ticker.

With Z's continued expansion into the mortgage business, it is way riskier than it looks at face value. Strongly considering puts, but dunno about timing this top. End of mortgage forebearance may be the catalyst for downward pressure on residential RE. Looking at puts out in Sept for that play. I dunno though. Z is a part of hte larger tech bubble imo.

Since it's going to be a pain in the ass to bring them all back (and the airlines aren't certain about demand returning), they are going to get sent to this company in Florida called AEI so they can put holes in the side of them.  Then, AMZN is going to start running them around the US to support their logistics operation.  SO...the airlines are going to get the MAX to replace them and BA is rallying on the impeding certification of the Max later this summer/early fall.  I'm playing it with SPR calls.
