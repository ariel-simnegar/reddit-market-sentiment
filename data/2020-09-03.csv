**Hypothesis:** The market is a massive, throbbing dick. 

During run-ups like this Tech bubble, the market is at its most excited and violent. And when it comes to crashes - since the summer, this happened after the Q1 pre-earnings run-up for Lululemon, the Q2 pre-earnings run-up for Tesla and the pre-post earnings run-up for Zoom.

LMAO, this made me laugh. That being said, we do have an employment report coming out today. Here's what to expect:

We are looking for a +1.2m increase in non-farm payrolls, which should push the unemployment rate down to 9.7% (versus 10.2% at present). In May, June and July, the report beat the expectations in three consecutive times! I don't see that trend being changed today.

BLS misclassifies some workers as ""employed not at work"", instead ""unemployed on temporary layoff"" which pushes unemployment rate down.

The failure to correct measurement errors we’ve seen in the monthly jobs report – and keep in mind that it is exactly the SAME ERROR being made for the past THREE MONTHS – is an intentional mistake. Same intentional mistake will happen today, too! (btw it also happened in Obama's era in 2013)

It is a power thing and a narrative thing and Trump is not going to lose this narrative. All in calls for today!"

use a HDMI to VGA cord out of your computer, connect to a VGA splitter, from the splitter have one VGA hook up to the test taker’s monitor and the other go to another room where you have your boys set up and seeing the same screen as you.

Cheating software can’t tell if you duplicated the displays if you use VGA. 

Then have a Phillips hue colored bulb setup in the testing room where the test taker can see it out of the corner of their eye. Each color is an answer (A Red B Blue etc.) 

Test taker doesn’t have to look away from the screen and the boys can lookup answers and send to test taker using the Phillips hue.

This is a once in a lifetime chance to get god tier scores.

Remember, even if you do things the right way, people like me don’t. Play dirty or get left behind."

In company with our brave meme & tech Allies and brothers-in-arms on other markets you will bring about the destruction of the Market Makers machine, the elimination of Institutional tyranny over oppressed peoples of moderate income, and security for ourselves in a free market.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 2020. Much has happened since the Covid triumphs of 2019-2020. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking."

I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.

I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away as I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. Maybe it's in heaven, or some other ethereal place. I don't believe, but pretending that I do makes me feel alive again, if only for one fleeting moment.

I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. For a moment, I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check the S&P futures. 3450. It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy.

Sitting in the empty, dusty room, I let out a broken whimper: ""futures flat... and gay."""

Looking at the chart on SPY most of the sell volume came in before noon - then it slow bled for a while and we got a solid amount of volume just before close mostly buy volume.  And on the 4hr and 1 minute charts we wicked pretty clean off 3420 which is the bottom of the trendline

If we were going to really dump, it would be hard and with some negative news to give it some momentum. I think we see maybe one more mildly red day (-3% on most of the big caps), then some green next week.

But I would be very surprised if this dip doesn't get bought up. Not to ATH but at leas to 3480 or 3500. IDK how much tech will bounce though. If we get big sell volume in the AM, IDK though, might break that trend line and go bearish

I am scared - just wanna get some buy volume to stabilize things a bit. Can't believe tech sold off so hard AH though, real fucking by the market movers"

Prediction for tomorrow, SPY south of 330 EOD.
Next ~~monday~~ tuesday will most likely be green because tomorrow will be oversold as fuck, but ~~tuesday~~ wednesday will be red again.
~~Tuesday~~ Wednesday of next week EOD is a good time to stock up on calls. I guess tomorrow wouldn't be a bad idea to get weekly calls to be sold on ~~Monday~~ Tuesday. LPT"

What part of “we will do absolutely everything in our power to pump stonks” don’t you get? DON’T FIGHT THE FED. You really think we gave a blank check to blackrock for them to not buy the dip? Do you think that we just randomly printed trillions so that we could just have “best august ever”? I don’t think so retards. So pull up your jammies and chin up. It’s not a loss until you sell and sell you shall not. Jpow will never let 🌈🐻 win ever again. At least until the elections.

This market is in warp speed, tech sector moves into ""return to normal"" phase within the next week-ish(tmrw wouldnt surprise me).  Some undervalued tech wont be as affected and will continue upward movement(see INTC) and some relative strength will remain in the sector. But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)

Next leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.  The vaccine is coming whether you like it or not. Put your political b.s. aside.  This is going to be a green light for getting covid impacted businesses going again at almost 100%. Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.  Position yourselves accordingly; things like (good)airlines, cruise lines, retail, restaurants, DIS...  might even add in financials

Personally, I'll be leaving a little bit of reserves to savagely go balls deep into Palantir when they do their ipo later this month.

for both SPY and QQQ, 0dte put options for -0.05 delta will cost about $0.2 at the open and be worth about $2.5 if they hit the money. That's a 12-bagger.

If you buy put options at the money on the open for about $2.5, they might go to $14. That's a 5 bagger.

My gut says that either this market turns around within the first hour tomorrow or it will be even more red than today.

If we open below the 20-day moving average, I'm going to buy -0.05 delta lottery tickets and some lower risk -0.4 delta puts.

2020-09-04 00:38:26,radioref,5,"SO, YOU BOUGHT OR SOLD A PUT - Now what?  WSB Retards edition.  

If you bought a put (this is what 99% of you did), and it is in the money on expiration date, you’ll be assigned stock SHORT in the ticker by your broker.  For example, you bought a put on AAPL that expires 9/18 with a strike price of $140, if you didn’t sell your contract by expiration date back in the market, on 9/18 end of day you will be short APPL 100 shares at $140/share.   If Apple is trading at $120/share like it is now, congratulations, you’re sitting on a $2000 profit (140-120 * 100 shares) — You better buy that shit back (called covering) quick at 120 and book your profit ASAP, you knucklehead.   Fuck you.

If you SOLD a put, and it is in the money on expiration date, you’re buying 100 shares of that stock from your broker at the strike price.  Congratulations new owner - but you better have the fucking cash!  For example, you SOLD a put on TSLA that expires on 9/18 with a strike price of $300 and got $580 in premium from the sucker who bought it from you..  When you did, you said to yourself “yeah bitches I’m theta gang now har har.” - Well, shit, TSLA dropped to $290 share by expiration date and the option is exercised.  That’s right, your ass is buying $30,000 of TSLA stock, but since it’s trading at $290/share, you’re already in the hole $1000.  You’re already in the hole on the stock, but at least you keep that $580 in premium you theta gang master.    Now, you might have actually sold 10 puts on TSLA at $300, because the premiums looked juicy and you thought “hey, easy $5,800 of premium earned - it will NEVER drop to $300!” — oops. Yes, in this case your ass is buying $300K, that is three hundred thousand dollars of TSLA, and in the above example you might have earned $5,800 in premium, but you’re down $10K in underlying value.  Oops.  Hope you like riding TSLA for a while.

Hope this helps.  Good luck"

2020-09-04 00:23:54,Viromen,14,"Look at RSP

What is RSP?

RSP is the equal weight ETF 

In our last mega crash 6/11 guess what, that week we fell 13% from ATH. Yet today RSP is down only 3%. Yet SPY/QQQ is down heavy in same way as 6/11? Can someone explain?

Yes. It's because tech is carrying the market of course. So a cool off in tech sends the index down. But if you look at XLE, XLU, XLF, GDX, these were nowhere near as much down. 

Conclusion - they want to rope everyone into puts over long weekend and reverse hard for next week. This cooloff needed for continued bullish growth to ES 3800 by November.

Another thing to consider - SPY rebalancing is taking place tomorrow with the details released. Rebalancing will conclude in the next week with funds buying etc. Cutting out the weak performers means that when we bounce SPY will bounce harder than before. 

TLDR: buy the fucking dip. No, this is not a March crash. No, this is not a liquidation event. Yes, the Fed will backstop this move down like they did 6/11. Yes, the pullback was necessary to pull us out of overbought.

Don't be a fool."

 * tesla is still full speed ahead on their plans (battery day, gigafactories, EU and China push, semi/cybertruck/roadster, solar push, robotaxi fleet, etc). Daddy was in Berlin this week and he had a video talking about factory progress  
 * apple is launching lots of fun new hardware next week and next month and they are still a money printing machine 
 * the oligarchs that own the world want normalcy so they can keep getting rich, so the vaccine speedrun is almost done and covid will be more or less contained by EOY in the US, but expect 200k people to be dead by then.

2020-09-03 23:29:33,pilotsepisode,-8,"An update regarding the recent shakeup. (Important)

As most of you know, I have been banned from r/Joker. 

This has been tough for a lot of us but I just want to thank those of you who have reached out with your kind messages of support (some Joker Heads some from also many other communities across a variety of forums.)

I want to speak out today because this ban is not just an attack on me but also on Joker Heads everywhere and not just that but Free Speech as well. 
This is what the Moderators have told me, verbatim:

“We unequivocally condemn your passion and vigilance for the sanctity of Joker . We want you to know that we will stop at nothing to destroy the Good Name of Joker that you helped to create almost singlehandedly”

I have been a major proponent in the inner and outer workings of what has come to be considered by most as the epicenter of Joker Fanaticism. I have helped build  and foster a community around Joker type values, Tricks, Jokes, and the likes. I have provided valuable insight analysis opinions rankings and much more to a community that desperately thirsts for such things.

I have been a voice for Joker. I have been a voice for you. 

I have not violated community rules 

Here’s the truth

They want to silence me because I love the Joker too much

This is problematic to outside sources that lose money due to the success and Franchisisation of the Joker Cinematic Universe: this is all a ploy by Marvel to crush our community one by one starting with the most powerful voices. They come for me now. Will you be next? 

They have paid off the moderators to begin a takedown, the forum may be compromised temporarily . But we can stop that 

We must stand together, and force the moderators of r/joker to unban me 

Everyone start creating mayhem in the community until they unban me and we can solve this problem"

2020-09-03 23:26:51,pilotsepisode,-18,"An update regarding the recent shakeup. (Important)

As most of you know, I have been banned from r/Joker. 

This has been tough for a lot of us but I just want to thank those of you who have reached out with your kind messages of support (some Joker Heads some from also many other communities across a variety of forums.)

I want to speak out today because this ban is not just an attack on me but also on Joker Heads everywhere and not just that but Free Speech as well. 
This is what the Moderators have told me, verbatim:

“We unequivocally condemn your passion and vigilance for the sanctity of Joker . We want you to know that we will stop at nothing to destroy the Good Name of Joker that you helped to create almost singlehandedly”

I have been a major proponent in the inner and outer workings of what has come to be considered by most as the epicenter of Joker Fanaticism. I have helped build  and foster a community around Joker type values, Tricks, Jokes, and the likes. I have provided valuable insight analysis opinions rankings and much more to a community that desperately thirsts for such things.

I have been a voice for Joker. I have been a voice for you. 

I have not violated community rules 

Here’s the truth

They want to silence me because I love the Joker too much

This is problematic to outside sources that lose money due to the success and Franchisisation of the Joker Cinematic Universe: this is all a ploy by Marvel to crush our community one by one starting with the most powerful voices. They come for me now. Will you be next? 

They have paid off the moderators to begin a takedown, the forum may be compromised temporarily . But we can stop that 

We must stand together, and force the moderators of r/joker to unban me 

Everyone start creating mayhem in the community until they unban me and we can solve this problem"

Bought back in with some profits at $480. Holding the line. If it can swing up $100 I'm not afraid of a $100 down swing It currently sits at $385 as I'm typing this. Willing to lose half of my repurchase. buying up some calls on the way down. currently holding 9/11 800c 9/18 800c. Retail traders running like pussies.

2020-09-03 23:20:50,8thSt,5,"Despite all the economic warning signs and the market breaks in March and May 1929, stocks resumed their advance in June and the gains continued almost unabated until early September 1929 (the Dow Jones average gained more than 20% between June and September). The market had been on a nine-year run that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average increase in value tenfold, peaking at 381.17 on September 3, 1929.[5] Shortly before the crash, economist Irving Fisher famously proclaimed ""Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.""[6] The optimism and the financial gains of the great bull market were shaken after a well-publicized early September prediction from financial expert Roger Babson that ""a crash is coming, and it may be terrific"".[7] The initial September decline was thus called the ""Babson Break"" in the press. That was the start of the Great Crash, but until the severe phase of the crash in October, many investors regarded the September ""Babson Break"" as a ""healthy correction"" and buying opportunity.

2020-09-03 23:17:03,namsilat,5,"I’ve given it some thought.  Here’s my concern aside from a few notable stocks.  Clorox, Hormel, Zoom, Amazon, UPS, etc, there haven’t been any fundamental structural changes to the fundamentals of any of these companies since the pandemic.  Sure, Tesla and Apple have proven that they will survive the pandemic, but they aren’t *profiting* from it.  So where then comes the additional valuation?

Sentiment, boredom, novice trading, and excess liquidity in the lower and middle class.

Analysts have been straight up *making shit up* to justify the stock prices.  “Well, sure, Apple is over valued for its sector, but maybe it’s a *consumer goods* company. Then it’s a bargain!”  Completely ignoring the fact that Apple’s profits have absolutely shit the bed lately, and that they haven’t had a growth quarter in over a year.

So why am I saying this? Mostly because I don’t have a forecast for how far this will fall.  Most companies that have drastically increased market caps have no reason to be up so high.  In Tesla’s case you have a company that relies on regulation rather than sales to turn a profit at all.

Am I saying these companies are bad? No.  Am I saying they’re going bankrupt?  Of course not.  I’m saying that without an underlying reason for this rally, we’re going to be relying on sentiment to price them on the way down.  And if that sentiment is panic, the FED is nearly out of ammunition."

Just someone answer me this. Where is the money going? As far as I can tell there is nowhere else to park your cash than the tech sector.

Bonds & fixed income are fucked due to zero interest rates.

Crowd favorite municipal bonds are triple fucked because so many cities face bankruptcy due to not receiving federal funding for covid.

REITs are mostly fucked due to garbage rental market and collapsing retail.

Oil & gas & energy is fucked due to oil prices.

Retail and consumer goods are fucked due to covid.

Holding cash? JPOW just announced we’re returning to 5% inflation.

You could buy metals but they’re at ATH too.

Everything is fucked while the megacaps are reporting record profits & growth. So where are people pulling their money to? What’s the idea? Because the way I see it, the only sensible option is a swift QQQ recovery from today’s crash, but mob mentality says it may extend into tomorrow as well.

I turned my September calls into spreads at a huge loss, keeping my october calls but bought UVXY OTM October calls with 5% of my portfolio."

2020-09-03 21:55:57,Revolant742,9,"CNBC might rationalize this somehow but this crash was ENTIRELY due to market financials rolling out of control. Markets got caught not once but twice this summer stretching the RSI too thin everywhere. FOMO has also encouraged a lot of money to flood the markets with little care for risk. Particularly in options.

The Fed's QE is actually deflationary so it actually makes these types of sell off events more likely IF MMs fuck with things too much. Jerome Powell gave MMs a nice rug and TWICE they rubbed their unwipped asses all over it before pulling it to steal YOUR tendies.

Options are key here because MMs might have created a monster selling options on Apple and TSLA. Tech in large too. It sent the whole market in a frenzy in a historically low volume environment.
A lot of share buying was maybe to sell US and other autists fucking options and as soon as its time, capitulation fucks everyone not paying attention.

Thats in part why I believe TSLA and Apple mooned so fucking much. The stock split was just the excuse. MMs fucked with things too much. This is the end result. Every. Single. Time. We even got a blowoff top.

So next time we go without a red day too long and VIX starts randomly rising. Best not to stay over leveraged."

I believe it was my instinct subconsciously telling me a day like this was coming like how animals can sense an impending earthquake. I should listen to my instincts more.

""A 5-bagger in hand is worth a 10-bagger in the woods."" - LePootPootJames

I was holding DOCU. It was up 1000+% yesterday morning. I didn't sell because I thought it would go higher because of IV going into the ER today. Miraculously, it was still up 100% today when I sold. No regrets though. I had good reason to hold. Today was a black swan day.

Ironically, today was one my best days scalping. 4 out of 6 trades resulted in gains. Overall, all scalps totaled in gains.

2020-09-03 21:32:07,saliym1988,9,"“Today the S&P 500 had its biggest drop since June 11. 

There were no major headlines or obvious triggers for the plunge, but it's left investors wondering if the day's drop signals another historic market event, or just a little in-flight turbulence. When it was all said and done, all 11 S&P 500 sectors ended the day lower. Technology shares slid 5.2%, their worst day since March.

Moody markets can take a toll on your emotions, especially in a world full of as much uncertainty as ours. But even with today's drop, we're still 2% above the peak we reached in February and 3.5% from a record high.

Most signs still point to an economic recovery. But there are a lot of obstacles between now and the end of the year: Stimulus uncertainty, budget negotiations, presidential debates, corporate conferences, and the election. The next few months could be a bumpy ride“ thanks for that ally"

2020-09-03 21:28:08,noentic,1,"# Daily Market and Options Summary for September 3, 2020 -

Daily Synopsis

* The S&P 500 dropped 3.5% on Thursday in an orderly retreat led by the mega-caps and growth stocks. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 5.0% decline due to its greater exposure to these names, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.8%) and Russell 2000 (-3.0%) declined about 3%.
* There were no macro catalysts attributed to today's steep decline, suggesting that profit taking and price exhaustion were likely factors in cooling off the market that many investors had described as overheated. Losses were broad, evident by all 11 S&P 500 sectors closing in negative territory, but there was a relative divergence between the losers.
* A bulk of the losses were found in the high-momentum stocks within the information technology (-5.8%) and consumer discretionary (-3.6%) sectors, which were the only sectors that declined more than the S&P 500. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 5.7%.
* The value-oriented spaces, like the energy sector (-0.7%), declined the least. To better illustrate this relative outperformance, the Russell 1000 Value Index declined 2.1% versus a 4.9% decline for the Russell 1000 Growth index. Not much consolation for investors, though, given growth and value both declined noticeably.
* Whether these losses materialize into a steeper correction in the coming days is uncertain, but the absence of a buy-the-dip mentality likely exacerbated fears of further weakness in equities. The CBOE Volatility Index, which is widely seen as a fear gauge and representation of hedging activity, spiked 26.5% to 33.60.
* Separately, Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter in 2021) was the latest Fed official to subtly urge lawmakers for more fiscal relief. Mr. Evans also suggested that economic activity might not return to pre-pandemic levels until late-2022 and doesn't expect inflation to pick up soon.
* U.S. Treasuries ended the day on a higher note, as investors assumed some safety amid the weakness in stocks and lingering growth concerns. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.12%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 92.73. WTI crude futures declined 0.5%, or $0.20, to $41.34/bbl.
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for August on Friday.

2020-09-03 21:17:24,infinitelimits00,2,"I could just be saying shit since I'm long, but I honestly think at least for AAPL, that was all MM selling shares. They most likely became super long shares due to selling a ton of OTM calls (why the call skew also became so high vs puts).  So they had to hedge the short OTM calls by buying shares. But if the stock slightly sells off, the OTM calls approaches 0 delta, meaning MM now can release their delta hedges by selling back the shares. This usually takes a few days too, with the last selloff being the most dramatic due to all the OTM calls going to 0 delta. 

I mean I don't think any institution or retail is selling Apple, out of the stocks out there they can sell. What are they gonna do with that money? Put it in a Marcus account?

There's a lot of data to support this actually and I posted an article taking about this yesterday, but of course I'm fucking greedy and held (the first response my post was spot on though).

But as soon as SPY drilled through 355 I knew today was fucking different. Sold all my calls right there for a 3k loss. Then I loaded up on 60k worth of SPY 345 9/18 puts.


That's right. 60k. I've been waiting for this SPY crash for a long time.


BUT... because I've been psychologically conditioned to get in-and-out quick with SPY puts (due to getting fucked one too many times), I quickly sold all of them off within 30 minutes, for a 4k profit. Ended up 1k for the day, feeling pretty good about myself.


If I had held those 200 SPY puts til EOD, they would be worth 130k right now.

Silicone feels SO much better.  It costs more but I think that evens out considering you need to use less.  The main drawback is that it stains absolutely EVERYTHING like a motherfucker and it's impossible to get out of sheets, clothing etc.

I think the optimal solution is to use water-based at home, and silicone at hotels / airbnbs / bathhouse / boyfriend's house.
