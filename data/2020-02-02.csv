> Charles Lieber is accused of receiving more than $1.5 million to establish a lab and do research at Wuhan University, according to prosecutors, who said he was paid hundreds of thousands more over several years. [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/01/28/harvard-professor-charged-for-lying-about-1-5m-chinese-research-scheme/amp/)

WEIRD: Isn't a Harvard Chemical Biology Professor under charged being connected to Wuhan? 

> The Chinese government has delivered on its promise to build a hospital for coronavirus patients at the epicenter of the outbreak within 10 days. About **1,400 military medics** will begin working at the hospital in Wuhan. [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus.amp.html)

WEIRD: Why is the Chinese government making a *military base* out of the hospital they just built?

WEIRD: How is it possible for the officials to have had 10 day plan to build a hospital in the first place? With the exact land already planned out?

WEIRD: If the numbers were correct then there was absolutely no need to build another hospital the first 2 days it hit the news. Unless they already knew beforehand how bad this virus was?

With China's history of disregarding the lives of their citizens - how farfetched would it be to suspect they were creating an undetectable biohazard virus and using their citizens as guinea pigs to test out all the possible cure? 

If that's the case where we have a virus that's, for the most part, undetectable and can be transmitted so easily without having physical contact - how deadly of a war weapon is this?

And how much power would the country who first discover the cure would have over the rest of the world? 

For that to happen it's almost like they would need massive amount of people infected with the virus to quickly try out different methods to find a cure... Someone please tell me I'm overthinking this.

Met her on seeking arrangements. Was my first sugar baby. I was intrigued by this young lady since she said she was a full time investor using the wheel strategy. When I first met her it was love at first sight. Her name was Bella. She was my sugar baby. I called her bellababy for short. Things were great. We travelled, ate food, had passionate sex. Then I started noticing things that were ""off."" Started with headless squirrels. Then raccoons. Eventually neighbourhood cat started showing up mangled and ripped to pieces on my yard. When ever I said anything about it to bella she just muttered something like ""hail sitri"" and stared at my cock. Eventually I cock her masturbating with a snake biting her nipples and drawing pentagrams on my mirror with her period blood. At this point I knew I had to move on.

* Patient treated successfully with experimental drugs in the US

* Second patient saw ""significant"" improvement with antiviral cocktail in Thailand

* China is injecting $170b Monday, I wouldn't put it past China to do it twice in the same week

* China has banned short selling temporarily

* Asymptomatic spreading appears to not be the case, early symptoms are just treatable OTC

* Successful treatment may mean spreading outside of China will be stopped, signalling successful containment


**Bearish Summary**


* We, without a doubt, are going to see more cases in the US - Whitehouse.

* We are teetering on a fine line right now, if there is going to be an outbreak worldwide it will be soon as the incubation period ends.

* Working treatment doesn't mean China will magically get all the supplies it may need, their economy could be in turmoil long after the virus is at bay.

* Guidance will probably be butchered this ER season. Even some permabulls could benefit from puts on companies that rely heavily on China.

* Even if we moon on news of containment/treatment, ER won't justify the numbers we're currently sitting at. Feeding further into the bubble."

The Chinese government is highly interventional and will do everything in their power to prevent any substantial dips by bidding up stocks.  Unlike the American stock market where institutions own 80% of mega-caps. In China, It is mostly individual shareholders and they fall prey to whatever the government wants the market to go. Moreover, the Chinese stock market has already suffered years of depressed valuations due to the trade war,  there is very little room for it to go down even further."

* Patient treated successfully with experimental drugs in the US

* Second patient saw ""significant"" improvement with antiviral cocktail in Thailand

* China is injecting $170b Monday, I wouldn't put it past China to do it twice in the same week

* China has banned short selling temporarily

* Asymptomatic spreading appears to not be the case, early symptoms are just treatable OTC

* Successful treatment may mean spreading outside of China will be stopped, signalling successful containment


**Bearish Summary**


* We, without a doubt, are going to see more cases in the US - Whitehouse.

* We are teetering on a fine line right now, if there is going to be an outbreak worldwide it will be soon as the incubation period ends.

* Working treatment doesn't mean China will magically get all the supplies it may need, their economy could be in turmoil long after the virus is at bay.

* Guidance will probably be butchered this ER season. Even some permabulls could benefit from puts on companies that rely heavily on China.

* Even if we moon on news of containment/treatment, ER won't justify the numbers we're currently sitting at. Feeding further into the bubble."

Futures green do you continue de-risking at now more favorable prices. If Red do you deploy sidelined capital? Where else do you put your cash? Yields are garbage. Have to go Equities or metals. Potentially but metals inflated do to fear and tensions. Counter-cyclical? Hmm. Defensive already with lagging inlow. Potentially overpriced. Back to equities. But hedged. Need to hedge. Long vol?

Murphy's Third Law:  Everything takes longer than you think it will.

 

Murphy's Fourth Law:  If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.

Corollary: If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then.

 

Murphy's Fifth Law:  If anything simply cannot go wrong, it will anyway.

 

Murphy's Sixth Law:  If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.

 

Murphy's Seventh Law:  Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.

 

Murphy's Eighth Law:  If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.

 

Murphy's Ninth Law:  Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.

 

Murphy's Tenth Law:  Mother nature is a bitch.

 

Murphy's Eleventh Law:  It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenious.

 

Murphy's Twelfth Law:  Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first.

 

Murphy's Thirteenth Law:  Every solution breeds new problems.

In between we will most likely get massive rallies that take the averages back up which will itself lift sentiment, similar to what happened at the end of the session on Thursday but much larger. After these rallies the markets will drop much farther and faster. Somewhere in there we will bottom but it will take several days, maybe a couple of weeks although I doubt with where the Fed is a drop will last more than a few days. I expect something like the Christmas selloff we got at the end of 2018 followed by a v shaped recovery. I‚Äôm holding a shit ton of March QQQ puts and weekly VXX calls so I‚Äôm not a bull but my call for a crash/severe correction is only due to excessive valuations and speculation, not fundamentals. IMO the markets needed a reason to come down significantly and the virus is causing enough uncertainty to get it. Once valuations drop 20-30% I‚Äôll be a bull again.

* Patient treated successfully with experimental drugs in the US

* Second patient saw ""significant"" improvement with antiviral cocktail in Thailand

* China is injecting $170b Monday, I wouldn't put it past China to do it twice in the same week

* China has banned short selling temporarily

* Asymptomatic spreading appears to not be the case, early symptoms are just treatable OTC

* Successful treatment may mean spreading outside of China will be stopped, signalling successful containment


**Bearish Summary**


* We, without a doubt, are going to see more cases in the US - Whitehouse.

* We are teetering on a fine line right now, if there is going to be an outbreak worldwide it will be soon as the incubation period ends.

* Working treatment doesn't mean China will magically get all the supplies it may need, their economy could be in turmoil long after the virus is at bay.

* Guidance will probably be butchered this ER season. Even some permabulls could benefit from puts on companies that rely heavily on China.

* Even if we moon on news of containment/treatment, ER won't justify the numbers we're currently sitting at. Feeding further into the bubble."
