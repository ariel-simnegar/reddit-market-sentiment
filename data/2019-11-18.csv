I think that Trump probably won't raise tariffs, and that into the election he needs to make it seem that trade tensions are
going down. He needs to probably get the phase 1 deal in by December, and start getting phase 2 ""underway"" as the
election heats up. That way he can brag about phase 1 deal during his tour. There's no way not getting a deal
is going to look good for his election, which is why I doubt he'll go ""no deal"" in december. he doesn't have much
to lose by getting a deal, even if its a crappy one, he can just say 'theres more to come' in phase 2, and phase 
2 could never show up

probably he needs assurance from Powell though, that he's not going to raise rates if the trade outlook gets better.
possibly he asked Powell to wait until AFTER the election to consider any rate increases, and that once he gets
elected, Powell can raise rates as much as he wants"

2019-11-18 23:19:54,BlueKnightJoe,11,"Let's talk about Trump and Powell meetings. The first Trump and Powell dinner was on February 4th, 2019. It was at Trump's invitation. They had steak (presumably well done with ketchup). Trump and Mnuchin sat on one side, with Powell and Clarida on the other side of the table. They discussed ""recent economic developments and the outlook for growth, employment and inflation.‚Äù The Fed switched directions and went from rate hikes in 2018 to rate cuts in 2019. There were no cuts until *after* this dinner took place.

Another private, unannounced meeting between Trump, Mnuchin, and Powell took place today, again at Trump's invitation. ""Just finished a very good & cordial meeting at the White House with Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve. Everything was discused including interest rates, negative interest, low inflation, easing, Dollar strength & its effect on manufacturing, trade with China, E.U. & others, etc.,"" Trump tweeted following the meeting.

We'll probably never know the exact words used, but it seems likely Trump is trying to bribe, pressure, and/or threaten Powell into cutting rates again in a big way. Powell for his part is probably doing his best to appear non-partisan, and we already know from public statements that the Fed wants to keep rates where they are until early 2021, unless the data changes significantly. Trump probably asked him questions like, how bad would things have to get before you would decide to cut rates again?

The timing of the next FOMC rate decision comes on December 11th, a few days before the December 15th tariff deadline. Right now the FedWatch Tool shows it's almost certain they will not cut. If I was Trump and I wanted to make the Fed decide to cut, I might announce a failed China deal and more tariffs *before* December 10th.

Trump would like to have 1. stock market at ATH   2. bigly tariffs on China   and 3. negative interest rates... the job of his advisers is to remind him it's impossible to achieve all three of these objectives at once. We'll see which is the most important to him. So in conclusion, either the rates will drop, the tariffs will drop, or the stonks will drop."

So if someone sets the price target for AMD at $40, it's quite bearish, right? Since they mean that the stock price will remain unchanged in a year and you are actually losing money if we take into account inflation?

I ask this because after WMT's earning, there has been a bunch of price target raises, mostly to 130-135. Should we read those as bullish or bearish signals?"

The only concern, as I mentioned last week, is whether Congress can successfully kick the can on funding. Progress was made today and the bill is expected to be passed by the House on Tuesday. Due date is by Thursday to avoid shutdown. If I hear no positive news on Wednesday about the status of the bill I may get a small hedge as there's little room for error and Trump can choose not to sign it.

Otherwise, have fun with your tendies you animals."

Wish I had the guts to buy over a week ago back when things were 25% higher and even more profits to be made, but I'm up 20-24k and thankful for the tip.

I may continue with buying back into puts on ACB later in the week, maybe after Wednesday's house bill on fed legalization happens. I feel like it wasn't selling off below 2.30 much today, though CGC still has lots of room to fall imo

Will buy back in Wednesday and hold 11/29 2.5P to profit off the inevitable Monday selloff from the new debt converted shareholders that want their money out of this soon to be bankrupt company"
