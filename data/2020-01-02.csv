If we do crash, it was done on purpose and will recover in time to make Trump look good for the re-election. If it barely drops, then it'll further fuel this bull run because if a war can't stop this, what the hell can?

In reality, big money dictates which direction the market goes and when it will reverse direction. They control the media and are the ones with enough money to actually stop a drop or cause a mooning.

Knowing this doesn't mean you will now get rich. The hard part is figuring out what they intend to do next and when. For now, I believe the midterm goal is to get Trump re-elected. For that to happen, a recession is not allowed to happen until after the election."

I have a hard time remembering Reddit is full of the same people.  Plus Facebook doesn’t have the die hard subs like Reddit does.  Politics and news have only talked about one thing for 3 years. 

Just meaningless comments that get upvoted like ‘Oh trump just starting ww3 to look away from his emails’ followed by 20 jokes until you hit the next comment.  

I almost wonder if Russian is planting thousands of bots to energize the Right to get out and vote for trump cause even as a moderate it makes me scared.  it doesn’t seem normal.

There might be some kind of minor oil embargo, but it'll be more for show, and nothing like the embargo in the 60s, as the Saudi's have little stake in the death of an Iranian general, and the Americans have stuck their neck out for Saudi Arabia within the UNSC time and time again. Now, Iran is a UN member state, however, the UN is absolutely gutless when in comes levying action against powerful states who betray articles 2(4) and 51, as we saw with the inaction of the UN after the unlawful invasion of Iraq, or NATO strikes in Kosovo. Iran as a state knows that it can't mount any kind of attack on US soil, however they'll probably continue to attack american infrastructure within the country, which will further escalate tensions, as american citizens, and military presence are withdrawn from Iran until a resolution can be decided upon.

How would a central bank use interest rates to manage the situation? The US crossed the threshold in 2005.  If birth rates precede and explain the Japanese sluggish growth leading to ZIRP then we SHOULD be able to see this if we look at per capital inflation adjusted gdp.

edit: here's the stream description

>Explosions have been reported near Baghdad Airport in Iraq. There is also an unconfirmed report of a rocket attack at Baghdad Airport. Get the latest in our LIVE BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE.

>There is no official statement on what has caused the Baghdad explosions, and whether there was a rocket attack at or near Baghdad Airport. Reports also say there is heavy US helicopter activity over Baghdad International Airport. In this interactive live stream, host Steve Lookner brings you the latest updates on the Baghdad Airport explosions in Iraq, and he'll also read your comments and questions on the air!

edit 2:  sounds like lots of planes are airborne after rockets hit Baghdad airport

edit 3:  physical sounds *could* have been American anti-missile forces regarding shelling Baghdad airport

edit 4: explosions (from Al Jazeera) could have been an IED on airport road (possibly killing Iranian-backed official + more)

edit 5: sounds like it was likely rockets, reports are now saying top PMF head [Iranian backed] (Mohammed Ridha) was killed

edit 6:  yeah, this Iranian thing is about to heat up.  Sounds like more than just the PMF head was killed

edit 7: PMF (Iranian-backed Iraqi militia) has announced death of public relations director"

Now i get we had the correction and it tracks futures not underlying stock or whatever smart people say, but like... when people talk about 3x ETFs they say oh it was sustained low volatility, you couldve lost everything if volatility skyrocketed

>The partnership has two main elements. First, Verisure will pay Arlo $50 million for Arlo's European commercial operations, covering marketing and distribution of Arlo products and services, the Arlo brand and Arlo's existing installed base in Europe. From -- the acquisition will create the first multichannel, go-to-market, for-consumer security experience. We understand Verisure plans to invest in sales and marketing to grow these channels significantly over time.

>Second, Verisure has committed to purchase a minimum of $500 million of Arlo products **over the next five years** to be distributed by Verisure. Verisure will also purchase associated cloud services from Arlo, including artificial intelligence, computer vision and other features. This agreement includes prepayment terms and other services that further provide cash for Arlo. In addition to locking in significant growth in Europe, we expect profitability to also improve from where it stands today over the life of the deal.

[Verisure took control of ARLO's eu operations today, hence the moon.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arlo-verisure-announce-closure-verisures-130000702.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEsKGvqvJ1_JNbCkSyAQ8SyJeOQzRXwBArnAGWdmYX6e_4RVRRWep347B3zY5MF_3yRI39OHoJxmFytKDCyqojoGFOU6tPxfp_M2EJYORQ6Oav2WvouoaXsXgeJn2MowJOaU42WdDrpqBz_OiHOO_ankpU0vKWMNwRKP0B5ca7Ho)

It's already pretty cheap to get in options dated after their Feb. 4 earnings, but I'd wait and see if it continues to moon or IV goes down. The announcement today could be a catalyst for ""priced in"" growth up to earnings, who knows.
