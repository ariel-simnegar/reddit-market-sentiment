If we do crash, it was done on purpose and will recover in time to make Trump look good for the re-election. If it barely drops, then it'll further fuel this bull run because if a war can't stop this, what the hell can?

In reality, big money dictates which direction the market goes and when it will reverse direction. They control the media and are the ones with enough money to actually stop a drop or cause a mooning.

Knowing this doesn't mean you will now get rich. The hard part is figuring out what they intend to do next and when. For now, I believe the midterm goal is to get Trump re-elected. For that to happen, a recession is not allowed to happen until after the election."

Now, Iran is a UN member state, however, the UN is absolutely gutless when in comes levying action against powerful states who betray articles 2(4) and 51, as we saw with the inaction of the UN after the unlawful invasion of Iraq, or NATO strikes in Kosovo. Iran as a state knows that it can't mount any kind of attack on US soil, however they'll probably continue to attack american infrastructure within the country, which will further escalate tensions, as american citizens, and military presence are withdrawn from Iran until a resolution can be decided upon.

edit: here's the stream description

>Explosions have been reported near Baghdad Airport in Iraq. There is also an unconfirmed report of a rocket attack at Baghdad Airport. Get the latest in our LIVE BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE.

>There is no official statement on what has caused the Baghdad explosions, and whether there was a rocket attack at or near Baghdad Airport. Reports also say there is heavy US helicopter activity over Baghdad International Airport. In this interactive live stream, host Steve Lookner brings you the latest updates on the Baghdad Airport explosions in Iraq, and he'll also read your comments and questions on the air!

edit 2:  sounds like lots of planes are airborne after rockets hit Baghdad airport

edit 3:  physical sounds *could* have been American anti-missile forces regarding shelling Baghdad airport

edit 4: explosions (from Al Jazeera) could have been an IED on airport road (possibly killing Iranian-backed official + more)

edit 5: sounds like it was likely rockets, reports are now saying top PMF head [Iranian backed] (Mohammed Ridha) was killed

edit 6:  yeah, this Iranian thing is about to heat up.  Sounds like more than just the PMF head was killed

I played some pennys in my day, i know endless R/S cycles just go down, never up, but SVXY went up to almost 600 a share and lost 9 tenths of its value in a week, half way down its 5 year chart.

Now i get we had the correction and it tracks futures not underlying stock or whatever smart people say, but like... when people talk about 3x ETFs they say oh it was sustained low volatility, you couldve lost everything if volatility skyrocketed

Well the chart says it did, but 3x bull ETFs won, so why does the SVXY value change so dramatically compared to market prices without a R/S?"

They ""missed"" their last earnings, but I listened to the call live and they spoke about cutting costs and future growth in 2020. I expect really good things out of them. [$500m of product is already accounted for by Verisure in EU.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/09/arlo-technologies-inc-arlo-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx)

>The partnership has two main elements. First, Verisure will pay Arlo $50 million for Arlo's European commercial operations, covering marketing and distribution of Arlo products and services, the Arlo brand and Arlo's existing installed base in Europe. From -- the acquisition will create the first multichannel, go-to-market, for-consumer security experience. We understand Verisure plans to invest in sales and marketing to grow these channels significantly over time.

>Second, Verisure has committed to purchase a minimum of $500 million of Arlo products **over the next five years** to be distributed by Verisure. Verisure will also purchase associated cloud services from Arlo, including artificial intelligence, computer vision and other features. This agreement includes prepayment terms and other services that further provide cash for Arlo. In addition to locking in significant growth in Europe, we expect profitability to also improve from where it stands today over the life of the deal.

[Verisure took control of ARLO's eu operations today, hence the moon.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arlo-verisure-announce-closure-verisures-130000702.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEsKGvqvJ1_JNbCkSyAQ8SyJeOQzRXwBArnAGWdmYX6e_4RVRRWep347B3zY5MF_3yRI39OHoJxmFytKDCyqojoGFOU6tPxfp_M2EJYORQ6Oav2WvouoaXsXgeJn2MowJOaU42WdDrpqBz_OiHOO_ankpU0vKWMNwRKP0B5ca7Ho)

It's already pretty cheap to get in options dated after their Feb. 4 earnings, but I'd wait and see if it continues to moon or IV goes down. The announcement today could be a catalyst for ""priced in"" growth up to earnings, who knows.

That's all I got boys. Good luck."
