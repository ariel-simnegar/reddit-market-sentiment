Now they've got a crazy ATH pile of cash, like 1.5 trillion, parked in the TGA at the fed and an election coming up soon. Pumping this money out in one form or another will inevitably result in a major boost to bank reserves, and we all know how that tends to boost stocks.

Theres no way Mnuchin doesn't understand this relationship. To me it looks like they've got the mother of all pumps locked and loaded.

2020-07-09 06:11:04,LehmanParty,0,"Question on Red Robin. Their credit facility agreement says they have to produce $25 million through equity dilution or by selling convertible bonds by November, yet their market cap is only about $110 million, give or take, so they would have to dilute shares by around 20% if they go that route. This is kind of a paradox. If the dilution is priced in, then the shares dropped already but when they dilute it'll still further reduce the price, so that price reduction hasn't been priced in. So maybe the dilution announcement isn't priced in.  It already dropped like 50% since the announcement so if they have to dilute from this point it'll just further chew up the equity, but that may include the dilution expectation, but it can't because this drop is pre-dilution, but no one would buy if the shares would have to be diluted by another 25 million before now and November.

Use your line of credit to send one of your degenerate friends the amount of cash you want. Then, have your degenerate friend send it back. Maybe threaten their hamster’s life to make sure they don’t steal your cash.

Since not all of you can get around a paywall, here is the intro paragraph about a guy that definitely posts here:

&#x200B;

>Richard Dobatse, a Navy medic in San Diego, dabbled infrequently in stock trading. But his behavior changed in 2017 when he signed up for Robinhood, a trading app that made buying and selling stocks simple and seemingly free.  
>  
>Mr. Dobatse, now 32, said he had been charmed by Robinhood’s one-click trading, easy access to complex investment products, and features like falling confetti and emoji-filled phone notifications that made it feel like a game. After funding his account with $15,000 in credit card advances, he began spending more time on the app.  
>  
>As he repeatedly lost money, Mr. Dobatse took out two $30,000 home equity loans so he could buy and sell more speculative stocks and options, hoping to pay off his debts. His account value shot above $1 million this year — but almost all of that recently disappeared. This week, his balance was $6,956."

2020-07-09 04:19:05,TheDolleyLlama,-21,"So I know it’s a big nono in here, feel free to downvote, but I’m genuinely curious about how this sub feels about the coin. 

In a high-risk overvalued equity market blown to silly proportions by the Fed, precious metals have been the go-to bull case from a macro POV. A finite resource is appealing as fiat is wildly printed with zero restraint, devaluing the fuck out of it and forcing dollars to be stored in assets. Gold and silver are bullish in these environments for a ton of reasons, but the fact that it’s finite definitely plays a role. 

On paper the coin is about to begin its cyclical bull market phase... but for the first time, this will coincide with an environment that is the reason the coin was created in the first place. Printing with reckless abandon, fiat devaluation, equity inflation, high-risk environment, macro financials super shitty, macro financial practices super shitty. Not to forget the new “RH retail wave” of investing, which will love the coin if it begins to take off. Those retards would throw money at a pile of shit if it could double. This whole leg up is driven off of stimulus and speculation; if that disappears in the coming months, how does the coin not become a very intriguing place to put depreciating fiat? 

I’ve felt this way for a while and am just beginning to see the twitter stock talking heads vocalizing this. Just curious to see some takes."

edit: BUD 7/31 $52c @ $2.75 or 1/15/21 $80C @ $0.65

Also TLDR: Inverse me to make money.

Here is some beer DD for you. There is a company (IRI) that tracks sales of products at grocery and convenience stores and then you pay them money to find out how those products are selling.

A few months ago, it was difficult to track draft beer (bars) sales in the US due to the nature of how that industry functions but lucky for you, Corona has eliminated the guesstimation of draft beer sales because there are none now!

You can now use IRI data to build a statistical model and pretty accurately predict how beer sales are going across the country. Guess what, they're up. Even Bud Light is up.

News article from May:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2020/05/31/off-premise-beer-sales-still-surging-according-to-iri-data/#4901ed7773a5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2020/05/31/off-premise-beer-sales-still-surging-according-to-iri-data/#4901ed7773a5)

Yes White Claw is eating everyone's lunch but when investors hear that Bud Light sales are up for the quarter in the first time since 20XX they're gonna freak.

You could use the IRI data to track $SAM and $STZ sales in the US compared to their past earnings and really make a smart decision on that earnings play.

$SAM is trading at 1.5x pre-Covid due to Truly being everywhere. $STZ killed earnings and is back to pre-Covid price.

MMs obviously have IRI memberships and are already doing this analysis so everything is most likely priced in, except for China. China state media says everything is fine so it should bring beer back to growth and calls should print. Watch for unusual options activity or large open interest on BUD options."

4.) Hordes of plebes invest in Stonks because the banks are offering shit interest rates. Stonks go up because more plebes keep buying in. Every year a new, larger class of plebes enters the workforce and invests in Stonks.

For years I've seen news reports and articles from European countries and America about climate change and overpopulation and how we need to stop having kids and what have you. Then a virus blows up and starts taking out the old people and the weak or those that win the lottery.

So we need to destroy the global economy by shutting everything down for something that mostly kills old people? I need to not have kids because of overpopulation but old people are the priority? Shouldnt government bodies be happy they got this hand dealt to them?In 20 years those old people will be either dead or attached to machinery while in twenty years kids will be productive members of society boosting the economy.

It seems bullish to let it go to town tbh.

If TA held up in this manipulated af market, those two ""M"" patterns on $SPY should have sent this thing to 311 today. Yes, I see the bull flag at the end of the day...but my thought is we got a fake OPEX cuckasaurus today to fuck over the put side of the chain (the media says news on the USD gave us a boost...they are really digging deep to explain this shit, one day they'll write an honest headline...""MM show green 1hr bar for the 2-3 hour, sucked in the bears and power fucked them in the ass until 4:15pm EST"". Now that's an accurate headline!). 

Anyway, me thinks that were gonna get some drill action tomorrow aimed at getting the bears all hot n bothered, MM grab up some cheap calls, then gap up overnight Thurs and power pump to a 318 Friday close.

Duh! He then surmised that Saudi would run out of oil by 2025 and wrote a book about it. Some oil trader read it, and he and his oil trader buddies bid up the price of oil to $150 a barrel for no good reason, really.

So bullshit book ready by oil trader greased with FED bux, and you get $150 barrel oil and the 'EV' and 'shale' revolutions. The shale revolution is going down in flames, and the EV revolution will too. This is why the FED shouldn't shovel shit loads of money at Wall Street, and finance people shouldn't read engineering/science papers."

**Eliminating the pandemic task force in 2018.** Refusing to accept WHO tests and waiting weeks for US companies to make their own tests. Not banning travel from Europe in February. Not instituting a lockdown in early March. Allowing states to do patchwork regulations on covid response while the feds beat off in the bushes. 

Forcing states to literally hide their supplies of tests in fear the feds would seize them. Not instituting a mask order. Inciting people to challenge stay-at-home orders and encouraging reopening of things like bars and restaurants. Pushing hydroxychloroquine without any robust scientific evidence that it works. And now trying to pressure students back into schools which are just petri dishes for contamination. The US is going to 5+ million cases easy.

Did you know on 3/3, we dropped 18 points from 313 to 300, and than next day rallied 18 points? I’m sure bulls got excited than. But over the following Thursday and Friday (3/5 and 3/6) we dropped 25 points total.

That’s exactly what we’ve seen today. An entire day shit just to rally to where we begun, with no volume. Next two days we shouldn’t be surprised to see a sharp downtrend.

As states accept the deaths or shutdown and election/voting turmoil ensues far out SPY 350 calls should start printing. I’m assuming SPY 420 with the addition of Tesla to the S&P.

Q2 earnings are gonna be shit for a majority of companies because it’s most of the shutdown. Covid deaths usually lag behind cases about 2/3 weeks. July 4th will spur the cases therefore July 20th deaths start to surge right when congress returns. Congress returns, earnings start eating shit, market has a slight drop,  they blame it on the covid deaths, July 20-August 8th 2nd stimulus is discussed and rushed before their next month long recess. Puts before July 20th?
I expect a ramp up or sideways next week and a half.

He buys 2 week out 305 puts, 4 grand worth or about half of his account. Holds through the red dildos before the closing bell yesterday. I sold my puts and switched to calls at 4:05 pm roughly.

Fast forward to today, he is promising that we will crash and “see 309” and that “I’m autistic” for buying calls. I sold my Monday bought calls at 316 this morning miraculously and didn’t reenter calls until sub 313. Added on dips for the rest of the day. 

I’m up 50%, he is down 50% and still holding his puts. I feel bad for him, but every time 314 be broke today I screamed sell and join the bulls. He declined and called me retarded.

Thank you TSLA for saving my ass once again. Didn't buy anything today though (was watching NVDA and I walked away for like 15 minutes and it had dumped and already V'd out). Same with TSLA, saw it dip but my order didn't fill so I just stayed cash

I had bought $25k of BABA stock during the dip in April/May but sold it somewhere early last month out of frustration during the fucking China trade bullshit. I had planned to hold that for a year or more and panic dumped :(

So sad that I missed out, but BABA is a fucking great company to own stock on. Always happy to see them doing well because I do believe they are undervalued as fuck and will continue to dominate China markets in the same way AMZN does in the US. And with BABA putting a ton of effort in to their cloud platform, now hosting with Equinix they are going to absolutely dominate the Pacific market for cloud hosting

Cashed out NKLA at 130% took 1/3 of my profit from that and around 3pm bought 8 7/10 $60 calls for .65. Up about 90% on those. 

Also started building a WMT 8/21 $135 call position picking up two throughout the day. Was even at close but if downtrend continues will probably sell for small loss and monitor the situation. 

Holding all overnight and hedged with some 7/17 315 puts. 

Gonna lose some money on BBBY calls I had before today but they were pretty cheap anyway. 

We will see what happens. Hope I can lock in my FD gains tomorrow. Didn’t want to burn my last day trade this week on them, because I want to roll the profit into AMZN calls for a scalp"

I honestly think if most people here had as many trades as they ever wanted during a week’s time, a lot of people here would pull out their gains instead of trying to ride the wave for as long as possible. It’s a psychology thing, knowing you only have so many moves left before you must sit on the sidelines. 

And 25K for the average person who is risk averse and tends to max out 401K/Roth IRA contributions first before spending a penny in true investing, is a lot to have laying around and hard for most to do.

June 2016, ECB started to enter corporate credit market. European stock market is barely up 2% each year since then. Could ECB save the equity market? No.

October 2010, Bank of Japan started to buy ETFs. Today Nikkei is still trading below its 1987 levels. Did Bank of Japan save the equity market? No.

Don't put too much trust on Fed.

2020-07-08 20:17:31,infinitelimits00,13,"Lol just made like a few grand on MSFT with no risk. People thought the earnings were 7/16 but there was no way it could be that (you have to announce at least 10 days in advance). So while all those people playing earnings were buying the 7/17 options, I just sold them, bought the 7/24 ones and locked in the IV difference from earnings with no delta risk since it’s a calendar spread. It’s not much per option since MSFT is a super low IV stock but I have a massive spread so it’s like 20 dollars or so per spread. 

https://news.microsoft.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-announces-quarterly-earnings-release-date-44/

Confirmed for 7/22. Not 7/16 like what brokers will lie to you about.

This is why you don’t trust your broker or free websites you find on Google. They want to trick you to make you do more trades. Now if you played MSFT too early, you have to get out of your previous option, but a new one = more money for brokers.  If you do play earnings, ALWAYS wait for the actual company to confirm. It’ll save money in the long run. MSFT is a low IV stock so there’s not really much to lose here but imagine it was Tesla. You would get severely IV crushed if you got Tesla’s date wrong."

Cons:

* Still reaching new highs in cases, deaths starting to creep up, states increasing restrictions and rolling back reopening
* US/China relations are the worst they've been in decades
* Trump, the market friendliest president ever (i.e., pumper), is getting crushed in the polls for the 2020 election
* Bankruptcies are exploding, 32% of people didn't pay their rent/mortgage in June
* Valuations are literally in the stratosphere

Pros:

Just about half of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone sales. You think people who lost their jobs are rushing out to get new phones?  


The February pre-pandemic price has been left in the dust, I guess because investors feel that big tech stocks are ""safe"" from the Covid recession? And yet, NOTHING has happened to justify AAPL going to ATH. Nothing very new in the way of products, no indications that revenues are increasing. Just plain euphoria.
