Disclaimer: cash gang. Mega corps will be fine this isn‚Äôt a standard bear post. This is more ramblings than bearish DD.

But seriously we‚Äôre fucked. States are re-opening way too slowly. Businesses are going out of business quick. People are literally not going back to work because of free money from the CARES act which they can get for 2 and a half more months. If people don‚Äôt go back to work even more businesses will close down. No one can survive 5 total months of being shut down.

People aren‚Äôt paying land lords and the back up will be ridiculous. Land lords are a job like anything else. Land lords have to pay back mortgages they take out on their properties. If landlords don‚Äôt get paid the banks have to foreclose on them.

All this money printing is even more insane. What do we do in 2 and a half months when there‚Äôs no economy left and everyone is unemployed? Just print more money?

This shit is fucked beyond belief. These lock downs were fucking stupid and will go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to this nation. Suicides, poverty, substance abuse, and domestic violence will reach unfathomable levels.

That said hedge funds and rich boomers will just wait this out so I‚Äôm not convinced of a massive leg down. Just saying. We‚Äôre fucked beyond all repair."

Their main weapon is psychology. If the Fed had to be the sole buyer in both the bond market and stock market the dollar would become worthless at light speed. Those markets are too large at current valuations and the Fed doesn't want to own every financial asset anyway."

A vast majority of the market movement is after hours, and 80% of after hours movement results in a gap up. So the window of opportunity for a bear to actually make money is very small.

I feel like VS alerted us to the power and influence of market makers. I think he overstated their control over the market and that led to some serious mis-calls based on his otherwise excellent TA analysis. But he was clearly right that market makers or large hedge funds are actively trying to dupe and fake retail investors like us. 

For example, on Wed. when everything looked rosey and SPY was marching to 297, at 3PM we had a HUGE dump. Like three massive red didlos. Everyone got scared on here. Some exited their positions. We went into close down a few points. Closing basically flat or slightly negative from open. 

The supposed reason for this? Some C grade reporter from some C grade online trading newspaper published an article that questioned Moderna‚Äôs vaccine study. She said nothing new in the article. Literally nothing new. This article did not justify the dumping that happened on Wed. At 3pm. (It could‚Äôve been Tuesday, I forget whether tues or wed. Doesn‚Äôt matter). 

Soaring unemployment makes the market rally and some buzzfeed article crap causes a huge 6-7 point dump in a matter of a minute? I don‚Äôt believe it. 

I think a hedge fund or a market maker or multiple forces in that realm of influence was trying to throw a head fake, shake the weak hands out. Same thing today. Obviously news in China is potential scary but come on, HK investors will flock to American markets. But that news was delayed. It didn‚Äôt happen till AH. During intraday trading today, we opened big and then dumped hard for the rest of the day. On what news exactly? Unemployment was actually not as bad as before. We are declining in unemployment numbers. And every state is reopening. 

The biggest focus of this months long rally from mid-March has been how the Fed has solved the liquidity crisis and now that Americans are getting back to work, this week should be booming.  But I really do think that market makers/large hedge funds manipulate the prices and trends so that small investors get scared out of their positions. 

All of this is to say that I think today‚Äôs red was fake and it is actually setting us up for a bigger green day tomorrow *or* we are red tomorrow but Tuesday goes green hard. 

Everyone expects tomorrow/today Friday to be a huge sell off. What if I told you that Thursday was the sell off, and Friday is gonna be the buying day? I‚Äôve seen it time again and again, what‚Äôs obvious hardly works. Go the opposite (within reason) and the market rewards you. 

End of rant. Btw I am literally regarded so take this all with a grain of salt from my tendies.

TLDR: Buy calls tomorrow."

I transfer 10k into my trading account and after that I buy 0dte calls which expire worthless and I dont even care to sell but when I check my account next day there are still 150 bucks in there. I realised that when I buy I dont actually buy of exact 10k but little less because of rounding thing.
And plus I have 7 accounts like that with 7 different brokers because of pdt rule I break it and move to new broker. So guess what this way you can also save 150 times 7 which is 1050 and guess what when you yolo those 1050 again you will end up saving some amount from that."

The United States President Donald Trump stated on Thursday that the US will have ""a very strong reaction"" to China legislation on Hong Kong.

China is planning to pass a law that will outlaw anti-government protests in Hong Kong. The legislation also aims to oppose secession of the Chinese autonomous region and forbids foreign interference in Hong Kong.

Earlier, Republican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley said he was planning to propose a resolution in Congress that would condemn the newly-proposed Hong Kong national security law

Preheat oven to 240F

Put your weed in a oven safe container and bake for 40 minutes, no more, no less. You want it broken up but not a fine grind.

Remove weed from oven, set oven to 200F, add 10mL olive oil per 1g of weed. (I like to do 300 mL per 28g.) Bake for another 40 minutes or more.

Remove, let cool, squeeze out the oil by wrapping the weed in cheesecloth. Discard the weed when you can't get any more from it. You'll recover about 80% of the oil, and if you did it correctly each mL of oil will be between 10 and 20 mg THC."

Like, nobody can predict the bottom, so sell puts that are OTM and if they are never reached, you profit.

If they are reached, and they get called, you buy a bunch of shares pretty low, and you ride a big rebound back up (hopefully you catch the steep ride back up that nearly everyone misses).

Like say when SPY was at 270 back in feb on the way down and you went out to sell puts at 240, you would have bought in at 240 and now been up like 25%.  Also if the puts were long dated this would ‚Äúeffectively‚Äù have you buying in at something lower (idk, maybe like 235).  Is this a decent plan or am I retarded?  Obv only do this with stocks you would see survive, like not USO or PLAY.

obviously not as sexy as 10000% gains from OTM spy puts, but this is a lot safer"

They aren‚Äôt traded on RH so put your boomer hat on and open a Schwab account. GTBIF is my favorite, had really good earnings last week. Really good. It‚Äôs the Leading weed retailer revenue now in the US. TCNNF price target was just upgraded to $50 (which even I think is too high for now) from Cantor Fitzgerald. 

Big revenue aside, states will need tax dollars now more than ever. Huge incentive to go legal for many more states. 

Also weed cures Rona, duh we knew that it cures everything. 

This is coming from your veteran pot holder of 2 weeks lmao. Going real long on this, I expect resistance 100%. But ever since GTBIF and ACB earnings, these guys have withstood big sell offs. Volume coming in off of weed news is growing. If you made it this far, don‚Äôt go selling off for a quick buck

Okay, so let me get this straight:

We 100% will have a second wave if reopening continues to happen. 

We 100% will not have a vaccine before the second wave, unless somehow the vaccine passes testing and can be produced and distributed at scale by Sept/Oct. 

This leads two scenarios (form a generic macro perspective, obviously we'll have ups and downs along the way)

1. Market crashes now, pricing this in, and then rise up to earnings and continue to rise until we confirm second wave in the media

2. Market rises until second wave, buy calls on red days, sell on green days. Opposite with puts."

I'm going to watch the prices of pharmaceutical companies on the process of developing a vaccine and I'm going to be looking for a correlation.  If there is positive news about hydroxychloraquine does it have an effect on said pharmaceutical companies.  I think some of the individuals coming out against it have some serious money on the line for the development of a certain vaccine. I wish I knew which one.

TRDL: I think hydroxychloraquine comments are the new ""trade talks going well"" cycle in terms of vaccines developing companies."
