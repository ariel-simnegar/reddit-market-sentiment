ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok‚Äôs US operations to Microsoft. We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok‚Äôs users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.
