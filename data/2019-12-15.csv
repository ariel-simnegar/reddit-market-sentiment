No, Dale, you can Google it like the rest of us. It requires one exposure to the concept of googling to understand how it works. Your generation was smart enough to cause a total economic collapse out of malice, but not smart enough to type in a few words, I guess. ""I'm not tech savvy"", No, you just refuse to learn like in most things, you are stuck in your ways. The worst part is after you help an old fuck with sort of tech bullshit 9 times out of 10, they'll give you some kind of bullshit passive-aggressive thank you along the lines of ""Oh, I guess you young people have to know something about those phones you're always on, huh?"". Give me a fucking break Gretchen, I have depression from living in the economy you created and my phone is more of a reprieve than dealing with your stubborn, inconsiderate ass. AND ANOTHER THING that just gets my blood boiling is their ability to get into their settings, completely fuck things up, and then manage to develop total amnesia about how it happened. What do you mean you set your phone to Japanese on accident, Phil? There's like 15 separate menus you have to navigate through to get there. ""I think it's because I got a virus"". No, Greg, It's not a virus, the only viruses here are your rampant stupidity and the deadly pathogens carried by your unvaccinated grandchildren.

2019-12-15 21:24:58,ToDaAtmosphere,5,"Have a short $24 AMRN put expiring Friday, rolling it up to $26. 

Last Monday I bought a $86 put on CVNA expiring 1/3/20, got completely screwed on it so far, but depending how tomorrow looks I may buy another contract. If it goes up not closing out though.

Still waiting to see what the futures are doing but I‚Äôll be selling a super wide iron condor on spy(like $10 wide) expiring Wednesday, will roll the strikes closer Wednesday morning.

EDIT: the autism here is real on what being short a put means."

Not sure what i'll do. Depends what the market and volatility do. This looks like we're going into a pretty boring time for theta gang."
2019-12-15 21:16:59,DadGoneGamer,3,"USTR saying the deal is ‚Äútotally done.‚Äù

So it hasn‚Äôt been signed yet, the 25% tariffs on $250b of goods is still in effect, and the 15% on the other $120b of goods won‚Äôt be cut in half until 30 days after the deal is signed which it hasn‚Äôt been and that leaves the door open for either side to back out."
