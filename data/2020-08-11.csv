How I do I know this? Because I have no idea how it works, and yet somehow I know more than WSBer with their life savings balls deep in shiny rocks.

No, silver spot price isn't related to COVID cases. No, MMs didn't create an artificial dip to FOMO into silver while the USD is rising. No, dip buying robinhooders can't save a global commodity by pumping a singular silver ETF. 

Yes, there is probably manipulation, but none of us have the insider information to understand it. Yes, it might go up, but if it does, you won't even know why (which is a bad place to be with any investment).

Ya got played by pump'n'dumpers. It happens to the best of us. Just exit precious metals and re-enter on equities you understand."

In other words, you're waiting for some sort of crash before you enter. However, consider that a) the crash might never happen in the near future; b) there are potentially other bears that are waiting on the sidelines to buy up dips; c) if a crash does happen, bulls can suddenly metamorphosize into ""long-term investors"" and hold shares for 5-10 years, during which stocks will surely go up. In the meantime, bears potentially lose out on more and more gains each day while the value of their stationary cash erodes.

Seems to me like bear plays can be successful in the short run - when we do get red days or some dip that might not be sustainable - whereas bull plays can be successful in both the short and long runs. What am I missing?"

YOLOD into CTAS, Slm, M, SPCE and tesla puts to watch tesla take back my pre-order, my mental fabrication of dominance in the market, feel like michael Barry when they are screaming, ""I WANT MY MONEY BACK MICHAEL"" and I cannot tell anyone but you all.... and my fiance who now is questioning her future life with me. I love this GAME BUT IT DONT LOVE ME BACK."

""Airline industry is operating under the assumption/analysis that any loans will be a bridge in 2021-2022 for recovery. Airlines not insolvent currently. Airlines are modeling that 2021 will be 60% of 2019 flying levels and 2022 will be at 95% of 2019 flying. Airlines were VERY profitable pre crisis. It is too hard to speculate the scenario where flying doesn’t come back because there are too many variables to calculate. This is why you see optimistic models, it is too hard to model the worst case scenario. Could easily see government ownership of airline companies. Government ownership de-levers the debt. Airlines are NOT insolvent.""

If you look at 2011, it spiked, then dropped off. That drop off was in part caused by the CME Group increasing the margin requirement multiple times in one week.

Be careful trying to catch this falling knife. They could announce margin increases any time. (Not sure if they do it during market hours, but I do know they did it multiple times in a day back in 2011.)"

the GLD, SLV pullback could be interpreted as a sign of reducing hedging, which could mean there's less risk in either holding cash, or putting it somewhere else; maybe a good sign

the 7-10 year, and 20 year treasury bonds ETFs (IEF, and TLT) were also down for the day. could that be a sign that interest rates may increase? again, a positive sign for the economy

Use a goddamn grown up platform like Schwab, ToS, etc.  Learn how to use trailing stop loss orders. You can use trailing stop losses even on options to reap all gains and sell off if a move is too big for your comfort.  It's a smarter way to find the top and lock in profits without sitting there and watching shit move all day and helps cut down on selling too early because you want to lock it profits yet miscalculated the ride up.  Many of you playing SLV could have protected yourselves with a conditional order on SLV set with a trailing stop loss.  Sure, you woulda been fucked since it gapped down overnight, but you were fucked anyway without such an order.  At least you wouldn't have had to watch it go all the way down -13% and it would have kicked in automatically so that you can go about your daily life."

>Whose professional company would you rather be in: your fellow retail investors or an institutional money manager? Go with the pros. You can always determine an institutional money manager’s real opinion on valuations when you ask them what they're doing with their own money.  Currently, many institutions are sitting on cash positions as large as 20% to 25% in their personal accounts.   
>  
>At the same time, institutional managers are compiling “buy” lists in areas where healthy companies are becoming distressed in terms of their short-term ability to meet debt payments or meet operating expenses. Investors who specialize in real estate, debt and private equity expect asset prices to get a lot cheaper over the next six-to-nine months. They have played this game before and know that it’s during recessions and periods of crisis when real wealth is created.    
>  
>Individual retail investors will also have another chance to increase their wealth.  Investment markets hate uncertainty and this time is no exception. The unfortunate truth is that no matter who is elected president in November, it will take years to get the U.S. back to the economic levels of January 2020.  Be ready for pullbacks in the stock market and dislocations in private markets.  And make a shopping list.

If you were an algo, how would you make the most possible money when tech is at ATH, cyclicals are totally forgotten, and rare metals are fully parabolic? 

Cash out rare metals and tech, buy all the trash cyclicals. Retail panic sells their metals and tech, then buys up the cyclicals with you. Now once cyclical FOMO and panic selling has stopped, swap plays, you sell cyclicals and start buying back tech. Once retail swaps back into tech, then start buying back metals.

You just made money 3-fold from the tops and bottoms each of the major plays, all while Congress still hasn't passed any stimulus, which will make your final tech buys even more profitable!"

2020-08-11 23:47:30,noentic,15,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-11-2020

**Context -**

The S&P 500 advanced as much as 0.6% on Tuesday on the back of continued strength in the value and cyclical stocks, but broad-based selling in the last hour of trading left the benchmark index down 0.8% snapping a seven-session winning streak. The Nasdaq underperformed with a 1.7% decline. 

The late-day selling was attributed to comments from Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY), who told *Fox News* that White House officials have yet to reconvene with congressional Democrats regarding fiscal relief for households and businesses.

Growth and defensive-oriented stocks saw increased selling that weighed on the S&P 500 information technology (-1.8%), utilities (-2.2%), real estate (-1.9

The financials (+1.3%) and industrials (+0.5%) sectors managed to close higher due to their perceived value. 

Notably, U.S. Treasuries and precious metals had sizable pullbacks. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 0.66% -- this curve-steepening activity was a boon for the financial stocks.

Gold futures fell 4.5% to $1946.90/ozt. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 93.72. WTI crude futures declined 0.7% to $41.66/bbl. 

President Trump floated the idea of cutting taxes on capital gains and middle-income families to further stimulate the economy.

Russia jumped ahead key testing stages to approve a COVID-19 vaccine. It appears unlikely that Congress would approve such legislation or that people would seek out the Russian vaccine. 

**Index Summary -**

They won in court and can keep doing their hyper-competitive licencing thing. Watch the price targets from analysts soar.

If they are allowed to sell chips to Huawei, that would be huge for revenue and profit. 

Broadcom tried to buy them for $82 over two years ago and Broadcom doesn't buy garbage. The 5G revolution was a distant dream back then and didn't hold as much value revenue wise. Now the 5G revolution is starting to happen.

Who wants to join boomer gang, if you put in 10k now, within 45 years with a 10% annual interest rate we'll have 1,000,000?

Edit: 

I got more!

Dollar cost averaging, buying into Bond etf's, only using part of my paycheck each month, only using money i can afford to invest, never cashing out, buying and holding for 20 years even if my stock hits zero or moons, then investing in shit like oil companies and budget grocery stores that have no fucking growth or volatility like kroger.

If you need someone to talk to but have nobody, I am happy to talk with you.  Please send me a message or as many as you need to get out what you are feeling.

If you suddenly revived your portfolio today, please learn from your mistakes and take it easy going forward.  This was your 2nd chance recovery.  Don't waste that opportunity.

2020-08-11 20:44:14,Neapoletard,15,"I saw Joe Biden at a grocery store in DC yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen electoral votes in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the ballots and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical voter infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each ballot and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

I’m a bull at heart, but I got burned big on 7/14 and have been super cautious since then, anxiously buying VXX calls and SPY puts then offloading them whenever we had pullbacks (23rd, morning of 30th) but always still thinking a bigger dump was in store. Tried again this month to no avail and by noon today I was almost 50% down since starting. So I capitulated. Sold all my stuff off and bought calls in what I thought were safer bets (BA, V, JPM). Then I saw how shaky things were at the top, and how cheap my usual positions were, and so the second my calls started to dip I sold them all (for some pretty good gains), using up all my 3 day trades, and went all in on SPY 8/21 336p around 3.20, VXX 8/21 25c around 1.45. I watched them soar, and I felt so vindicated. But then the dip started to pump and I got nervous I was gonna get burned again, so I bought a 8/14 337c at like 1.00 just in case things reversed. Ended the day up 20% all time. I hope this lasts another day or so, and then I’ll finally be able to calmly be a bull again and not always be tired and sad."

Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.[136] In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade. She proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations.

Pros: I'm 24 with a great job and no debt. 

Cons: this is a little over half my net worth. 

Not sure if I'll survive to tell the tale again. If I do I'm pulling out enough to max my Roth IRA and putting the rest in shares to never look at.
