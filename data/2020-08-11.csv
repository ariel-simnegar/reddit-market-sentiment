How I do I know this? Because I have no idea how it works, and yet somehow I know more than WSBer with their life savings balls deep in shiny rocks.

No, silver spot price isn't related to COVID cases. No, MMs didn't create an artificial dip to FOMO into silver while the USD is rising. No, dip buying robinhooders can't save a global commodity by pumping a singular silver ETF. 

Yes, there is probably manipulation, but none of us have the insider information to understand it. Yes, it might go up, but if it does, you won't even know why (which is a bad place to be with any investment).

In other words, you're waiting for some sort of crash before you enter. However, consider that a) the crash might never happen in the near future; b) there are potentially other bears that are waiting on the sidelines to buy up dips; c) if a crash does happen, bulls can suddenly metamorphosize into ""long-term investors"" and hold shares for 5-10 years, during which stocks will surely go up. In the meantime, bears potentially lose out on more and more gains each day while the value of their stationary cash erodes.

Seems to me like bear plays can be successful in the short run - when we do get red days or some dip that might not be sustainable - whereas bull plays can be successful in both the short and long runs. What am I missing?"

Apple sh*res 
TLT 168c 8/14

ATVI 83c 8/21
ATVI 85c 9/18
PSTG 20c 9/18
APPS 22.5/25c 9/18

NO HEDGES, trust your vibe. Market is going to stay propped until close to election. That being said, I'm probably going cash gang mid-late September. I'm starting to lose money on retarded market movements. For those of you doubting your ATVI calls, do more research on Aug-Sep movement.

""Airline industry is operating under the assumption/analysis that any loans will be a bridge in 2021-2022 for recovery. Airlines not insolvent currently. Airlines are modeling that 2021 will be 60% of 2019 flying levels and 2022 will be at 95% of 2019 flying. Airlines were VERY profitable pre crisis. It is too hard to speculate the scenario where flying doesn‚Äôt come back because there are too many variables to calculate. This is why you see optimistic models, it is too hard to model the worst case scenario. Could easily see government ownership of airline companies. Government ownership de-levers the debt.

This means traders need more cash in their account per contract, which pressures some traders to sell, driving down prices.

If you look at 2011, it spiked, then dropped off. That drop off was in part caused by the CME Group increasing the margin requirement multiple times in one week.

Be careful trying to catch this falling knife. They could announce margin increases any time. (Not sure if they do it during market hours, but I do know they did it multiple times in a day back in 2011.)"

2020-08-12 02:27:09,thrwy8234,3,"perhaps the general pullback happened due to the possibility of a lack of stimulus. this can be considered a positive sign of economic recovery

the GLD, SLV pullback could be interpreted as a sign of reducing hedging, which could mean there's less risk in either holding cash, or putting it somewhere else; maybe a good sign

the 7-10 year, and 20 year treasury bonds ETFs (IEF, and TLT) were also down for the day. could that be a sign that interest rates may increase? again, a positive sign for the economy

SPY seems to have recovered a little AH, and QQQ as well, and at least some cash was put back in

Use a goddamn grown up platform like Schwab, ToS, etc.  Learn how to use trailing stop loss orders. You can use trailing stop losses even on options to reap all gains and sell off if a move is too big for your comfort.  It's a smarter way to find the top and lock in profits without sitting there and watching shit move all day and helps cut down on selling too early because you want to lock it profits yet miscalculated the ride up.  Many of you playing SLV could have protected yourselves with a conditional order on SLV set with a trailing stop loss.  Sure, you woulda been fucked since it gapped down overnight, but you were fucked anyway without such an order.  At least you wouldn't have had to watch it go all the way down -13% and it would have kicked in automatically so that you can go about your daily life."

"" I thought as I dug my face into the collar of my trenchcoat. My thoughts lingered on the idea of going home; ""Wife's probably asleep by now, besides, I couldn't look her in the face after getting in on KODK at 50"".

I made my way down Wall Street, ""crooks"", I said out loud, setting up my buy order to average down on my -80% puts. The rain was picking up, and I decided to find shelter in a small bar a few blocks down, and there she was, the most beautiful girl I had ever laid eyes on, I had to find out what her name was. As I made my way down to her, I began to get anxious, never had I done this since I got married, overcoming my fear I walked up to her and said: ""Can I get you a drink, in exchange for your name?"" I smiled, hiding the fact that this might be one of the worst openings I had ever used, it's the autism. The girl smiled back ""Sure, I'll have a bloody mary, the name's Silver, but my friends call me SLV."""

If you were an algo, how would you make the most possible money when tech is at ATH, cyclicals are totally forgotten, and rare metals are fully parabolic? 

Cash out rare metals and tech, buy all the trash cyclicals. Retail panic sells their metals and tech, then buys up the cyclicals with you. Now once cyclical FOMO and panic selling has stopped, swap plays, you sell cyclicals and start buying back tech. Once retail swaps back into tech, then start buying back metals.

You just made money 3-fold from the tops and bottoms each of the major plays, all while Congress still hasn't passed any stimulus, which will make your final tech buys even more profitable!"

Had he taken a passive tone at the outset, he could have gotten a short term deal but that is not his style and it is backfiring.  He can try to blame democrats for the fallout but it will help just as much as his EOs did."

2020-08-11 23:47:30,noentic,15,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-11-2020

**Context -**

The S&P 500 advanced as much as 0.6% on Tuesday on the back of continued strength in the value and cyclical stocks, but broad-based selling in the last hour of trading left the benchmark index down 0.8% snapping a seven-session winning streak. The Nasdaq underperformed with a 1.7% decline.¬†

The late-day selling was attributed to¬†comments from Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY), who told¬†*Fox News*¬†that¬†White House officials have yet to reconvene with congressional Democrats regarding fiscal relief for households and businesses.

Growth and defensive-oriented stocks saw increased selling that weighed on the S&P 500 information technology (-1.8%), utilities (-2.2%), real estate (-1.9

The financials (+1.3%) and industrials (+0.5%) sectors managed to close higher due to their perceived value.¬†

Notably, U.S. Treasuries and precious metals had sizable pullbacks. The 2-yr yield increased three basis points to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased eight basis points to 0.66% -- this curve-steepening activity was a boon for the financial stocks.

Gold futures fell 4.5% to $1946.90/ozt. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 93.72. WTI crude futures declined 0.7% to $41.66/bbl.¬†

President Trump floated the idea of cutting taxes on capital gains and middle-income families to further stimulate the economy.

Russia jumped ahead key testing stages to approve a COVID-19 vaccine. It appears unlikely that Congress would approve such legislation or that people would seek out the Russian vaccine.¬†

**Index Summary -**

I got more!

Dollar cost averaging, buying into Bond etf's, only using part of my paycheck each month, only using money i can afford to invest, never cashing out, buying and holding for 20 years even if my stock hits zero or moons, then investing in shit like oil companies and budget grocery stores that have no fucking growth or volatility like kroger.

If you feel sad, hopeless, depressed, or worse, please talk to someone about it.  Mistakes happen, sometimes many times in a row, and that's alright.  You are worth far more than the sum of your mistakes.

If you need someone to talk to but have nobody, I am happy to talk with you.  Please send me a message or as many as you need to get out what you are feeling.

If you suddenly revived your portfolio today, please learn from your mistakes and take it easy going forward.  This was your 2nd chance recovery.  Don't waste that opportunity.

Get out if you need to :)

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen electoral votes in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the ballots and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical voter infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each ballot and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

I‚Äôm a bull at heart, but I got burned big on 7/14 and have been super cautious since then, anxiously buying VXX calls and SPY puts then offloading them whenever we had pullbacks (23rd, morning of 30th) but always still thinking a bigger dump was in store. Tried again this month to no avail and by noon today I was almost 50% down since starting. So I capitulated. Sold all my stuff off and bought calls in what I thought were safer bets (BA, V, JPM). Then I saw how shaky things were at the top, and how cheap my usual positions were, and so the second my calls started to dip I sold them all (for some pretty good gains), using up all my 3 day trades, and went all in on SPY 8/21 336p around 3.20, VXX 8/21 25c around 1.45. I watched them soar, and I felt so vindicated. But then the dip started to pump and I got nervous I was gonna get burned again, so I bought a 8/14 337c at like 1.00 just in case things reversed. Ended the day up 20% all time. I hope this lasts another day or so, and then I‚Äôll finally be able to calmly be a bull again and not always be tired and sad."

Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.[136] In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade. She proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations.

Boys I'm in a fuck ton of pain right now. 

This is the THIRD time I've blown up my account and it's really shown how dangerous feeling numb to losing (to me) a fuck ton of money is. 

Pros: I'm 24 with a great job and no debt. 

Cons: this is a little over half my net worth. 

Not sure if I'll survive to tell the tale again. If I do I'm pulling out enough to max my Roth IRA and putting the rest in shares to never look at. 

Puts on my intelligence"
