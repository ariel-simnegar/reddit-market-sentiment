Economics is not about anything but society. Society is everyone's life, all of us people who live today and also live in the future.

We cannot solve the economic crisis we are entering into with monetary and fiscal policy. We need to get the wheels rolling again as soon as possible. Unemployment is rising second by second. If we get a high unemployment rate, everyone in the whole country is affected, not only those who lose their job but also the pensioners. Rising unemployment is hitting the pensions directly.

Quote from an article out of Wall Street Journal 19/3: ""Rethinking the Coronavirus shutdown""

¬†*‚ÄùYet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don‚Äôt mean federal spending. We mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn‚Äôt true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.‚Äù*"

Look at futures at 7 am eastern. Ignore what's happening from 2 am until 7 am. Light volume allows for many hallucination like signals for day ahead. 

Pmi for the us at 945 am. Expecting manufacturing to be around consensus (41) but I do think services will miss estimates and be in the 30s as well as composite. Bearish but probably won't cause a big candle down. Maybe the fed might allow it just so today will look like a nice bullish candle lmao. 

I do not think we have seen a bottom yet. The mortgage market is screaming. Credit markets still are under stress, though the fed has helped.

so again, will the government really be able to relax standards until we have a vaccine? imagine a year of social distancing. eventually were gonna have to choose between: complete economic collapse or overrunning our healthcare system and allowing millions to die. either way thats fucked

Funfact: the stock act was largely celebrated by everyone, and it prevented insider trading and made it illegal.

Market probably won't like that very much.

This will not recover properly until we reach Peak Virus in the US.

>The Federal Reserve's role is guided by its mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices, along with its responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. In support of these goals, the Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses. These actions include:

>Support for critical market functioning. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy. The FOMC had previously announced it would purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the FOMC will include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage-backed security purchases.

>Supporting the flow of credit to employers, consumers, and businesses by establishing new programs that, taken together, will provide up to $300 billion in new financing. The Department of the Treasury, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), will provide $30 billion in equity to these facilities.

>Establishment of two facilities to support credit to large employers ‚Äì the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) for new bond and loan issuance and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds.
Establishment of a third facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses. The TALF will enable the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and certain other assets.

>Facilitating the flow of credit to municipalities by expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) and bank certificates of deposit.

>Facilitating the flow of credit to municipalities by expanding the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to include high-quality, tax-exempt commercial paper as eligible securities. In addition, the pricing of the facility has been reduced."

The ease of buying and selling even the safest, most high-quality assets has deteriorated dramatically. JPMorgan has dubbed it the ‚ÄúGreat Liquidity Crisis‚Äù, noting that it has piled extra volatility on to already fragile market conditions.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúThis is not a traditional liquidity situation,‚Äù said Peter Tchir, head of global macro strategy at Academy Securities. ‚ÄúWe are in unprecedented territory.‚Äù

&#x200B;

At the heart of the problem are the big banks that are central to the business of trading. Up to 2008, they often used their balance sheets to store assets in an effort to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers. But since that crisis, more stringent rules on capital have made banks less willing to act as intermediaries by providing so-called warehousing of risk, instead looking to connect buyers and sellers immediately. Fund managers have complained that this has made it harder to trade."

Corporations with the ""Board, Directors, ND upper management"" have been catogorizing employees or employment as a cost of doing business. In such a way as 1600 salavery has done to buying a slave for it's expected return on investments. 
Investments are such that employees are now commodities that benefit few.

Take a hard look at:
https://wtfhappenedin1971.com

This is the thread and seed planting that is slowing gaining perspective and thought. Something I can across is why do you pay taxes?

We buy in and support movements that benefit an individual or corporation because by nature we are all, ""Hard work deserves reward"". Yet, yet we and they are oblivious to the fact as we struggle to find the means to eat or find care in health, to worry about making decisions about sacrifices to the constitutional rights as a free man, we are sheep.
This time in history needs to continue to break down this oligarchy or Fiat entitlement.

Either now or within 50 years.

Italy is already getting less infections and deaths. The market has taken a spanking and now understands the exponential growth of corona. The unemployment may be high in the short term but with federal stimulus it could be solved very quickly. We dropped hard and we might rip up just as quick. üåàüêª out.

Ford was last trading at $4.14 today - we are pretty certain they will get Government help.

A month ago they were trading from $7.67 to $6.79

Call option $6.00 EXP 4/3  asking price $.03

Call option $5.50 EXP 4/3 asking price $.05

What are the odds Ford moves that aggressively when the bailout is announced?

IF they make it to $5.xx by the end of this week, there should be enough time value left that you could at least 5x your money?

I already placed my orders to buy $5k worth, but am I missing something here or did I stumble upon a golden opportunity?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I appreciate the candid feedback.  Previously, I made a mistake that cost me $100k because I deviated from my original plan and sold too early, I allowed myself to be influenced by someone's opinion.

I took your words with a grain of salt and wanted to make sure I wasnt missing anything BIG.  My own crazy fundamentals told me I should buy Ford so I did at opening bell.

I sold a chunk close to closing bell to get a chunk of my investment back.

Here is where I stand right now and plan to sell tomorrow once I reach my target:

* SPY has bounced off 220 several times

* VIX is extremely high and trending down, keeping puts off the market. Sure, you can short vix for vega-neutral position, but that raises capital costs.

* two red days in a row

* bulls salivating as the multi-trillion dollars stimulus bill hovering

* 2.5 million new unemployed ""pRiCed iN""

Unclear if this is some big brain shit or I'm legitimately disabled, but I've been spending some time thinking about ways in which one can effectively go short on a state.

At a high level, I think that Florida is especially fucked and we should throw the whole thing out, but seeing as that isn't an option geographically, I'd be happy to make money off their misfortune. Same with New York to some extent, but more bullish on Florida eating shit.

How would one go about shorting the state itself? Puts on REITs that are primarily based on Florida properties? I'm not quite sure where to start but I think Florida in particular is gonna eat shit so help a brother out before my wife's boyfriend beats me up again

They are simply separate balances held within a Robinhood brokerage account. That means your cash at Robinhood is not insured by the FDIC, a government agency that oversees banks for safety, soundness and consumer protection.

And that cash is also not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, which oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers if they go bankrupt or close because of financial trouble, and helps track down customer assets or cash that is missing.


An important piece of info for those questioning Robinhoods solvency.

If they go under, *you get nothing.*

They are not a real broker.

PMI is the Purchasing Managers index which surveys businesses in each sector of the economy, services and manufacturing and bridges then together with the composite. They survey purchasing managers of the private sector about what their business activity was like during the month, what they expect for current and future business activity. They then put it into an index. A number above 50 signals an expansion. A number below 50 signals a contraction. 

US PMI was last at 49.4 for services, 49.6 for composite and 50.7 for manufacturing. 

The NBER uses this index to help date recessions. The first sign of trouble during the GFC was a drop below 50 for services ism (similar to pmi) in late 2007.

I mean shit, look at WSB numbers - in like one quarter shit went up 400,000 people. What will that mean when a bottom is established? Will the speed of a rise back up be just as fucking fast?"

>While he acknowledged there were trade-offs ‚Äî ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no question about that‚Äù ‚Äî he claimed that, if closures stretch on for months, there would be ‚Äúprobably more death from that than anything that we‚Äôre talking about with respect to the virus.‚Äù

In so many words he just literally said ""Some of you are going to die and I am okay with that.""


This is fucking bad. They need to suspend trading let fed infinite QE float supply side liquidity, then congress needs to ensure demand side liquidity with corona checks. The alternative is millions of infected AND a couple of million dead.

You think New York is bad? It's a fucking preview if we don't get this shit under control.

Basically people asking why get the pump at that time instead of later after open. There is a reason as I said and I‚Äôm going to break it down simple and dirty. 

It was clear to anyone with a brain watching Friday close and the weekend cycle that Monday open was going to be a shit show. A large spike in Volatility and probably 2 CB pretty quickly. If the FED would have waited and got their pump after open it would have been MERCILESSLY and AGGRESSIVELY sold into. That action would have triggered cascade selling by algos and panic selling by real traders and with that fuel we might have had a real chance at our first -20% day. 

By announcing when they did and getting The pump when they did they killed the limit down action and buffered the open from a serious volatility spike. Effectively floating the open and cushioning it from the extremes.***"

Every time Trump pulls out something people say he's out of ammo and then he does more shit, he will do anything in his power to manipulate the market or at least distract from the problem.

And yeah it doesn't always work and he can only keep doing it for so long, but I've been burned by that too many times now.

I'll see what happens but be on the lookout for things not being as drastic as people say they will be, get out of your positions and don't get into any new positions if things don't go according to your plans.

Due to fed pumping and liquidity l; Market is going to go side way for the next several weeks/months. 

This means, IV crush your nuts

So how can you make money? 

Day fucking trade. Look at daily SPY charts. 

For the past week it has been going Ziczac throughout the day. Meaning (buy FD calls at 221 sells at 227; reverse with puts at 228); repeat multiple time during the day. 

I made steady 4-8k a day last week doing this (using almost 15k cash from my account). 

1-rule; don‚Äôt get fucking greasy, get out with 20-30% profit); 

2- you may have to double down often; therefore, buy smaller amount of contracts 

3-This strategy does not work well with large number of contracts; as you can easily get cucked 

Since premiums are through the roof, and IV is getting fucked, it is not worth to hold options over night; sell them in 30min-1hr tops.

What for IV when you buy and sell. 

Good luck fucking retards.

This is my plan for the next 4 weeks. 

And don‚Äôt fucking gamble with more than you can lose"

I'm likely going to target companies that are less risk during this pandemic.

2020-03-23 22:00:12,tanderson1121,2,"‚ÄúThe legislation, called the Student Debt Emergency Relief Act, proposes the cancellation of at least $30,000 in outstanding debt, tax-free, and proposes that the Education Department (ED) ‚Äúimmediately assume responsibility‚Äù for the monthly payments of borrowers‚Äù 

Ok so if this bill passes (which is questionable) that means that the department of education becomes the ‚Äúborrower‚Äù. But wait...the fed just said they‚Äôll buy student loans, aka they will be the ‚Äúlender‚Äù. So the government yet again (just like they do with treasuries) is borrowing against itself, aka fake news. 

What will be the result of this. I‚Äôll tell you. Tuitions will go even HIGHER. because now colleges can assume that since the government is essentially paying for college using ‚Äúfake money‚Äù they can charge whatever they want. 

Sorry for my several long rants today, but every article I‚Äôm reading today is more ridiculous than the last. The death of capitalism and the free market is occurring before our eyes. But I‚Äôll take a break now and let you autists and me enjoy some tendies.

EDIT: yes capitalism has been dead for a while. Prolly since 2008."

2020-03-23 21:07:02,aggieclams,11,"Totally miscalculated the FED busting the unlimited QE out overnight and got wrecked on VIX plays. I thought there were a few more days of panic and chaos, not a slow slide down. But it seems like the calming is coming sooner than I thought. Forced calming I guess....suprise, surprise from daddy FED.

So I switched over to riding the SVXY wave. Went all in on that. I was going to play this back and forth originally but that FED play overnight fucked me. Just glad I got out when I did today and switched over. The life of playing around with VIX I guess."
