Economics is not about anything but society. Society is everyone's life, all of us people who live today and also live in the future.

We cannot solve the economic crisis we are entering into with monetary and fiscal policy. We need to get the wheels rolling again as soon as possible. Unemployment is rising second by second. If we get a high unemployment rate, everyone in the whole country is affected, not only those who lose their job but also the pensioners. Rising unemployment is hitting the pensions directly.

Quote from an article out of Wall Street Journal 19/3: ""Rethinking the Coronavirus shutdown""

¬†*‚ÄùYet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don‚Äôt mean federal spending. We mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn‚Äôt true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.‚Äù*"

2020-03-24 11:07:45,originalmuggins,5,So is this just because Trump said we will stop the social distancing soon? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure state leaders are in charge of that and putting on increasingly strict and long measures.

2020-03-24 11:07:19,Rubenov,0,Looks like the stimulus will be approved today
2020-03-24 11:07:15,RobertFKennedy,1,"Ok bulls. What‚Äôs our plan?

- PMI numbers at 9:45.
- still working on bill, probably will not pass today.
- weekly jobless claims Thursday 

Do we cash in at open pre PMI? Or hold on for a potential 2 day recovery? It feels ready to do a 2 day recovery but that allows the virus numbers to potentially jump up to shocking levels.


Thoughts?"
