If the FDs go to zero - which is highly likely at this point, their cost basis was around 2200 which will be offset by the sale of my VXX and NIO puts and some. If we moon for some weird reason my FDs will print and I have buying power for other plays. If we get that leg down I have buying power. Feels good. Either way not gonna force any plays today.

2020-07-22 09:05:57,RayCashIsTrashDalio,7,"remember last quarter TSLA earnings. TSLA is at 750ish.  TSLA had their 3rd positive quarter in a row. TSLA gaps up to like $800, and then proceeds to dump in a straight line despite beating earnings estimates. elon proceeds to go on a twitter meltdown and tweet ""stock is too high"" TSLA dumps to $700 briefly. TSLA is at $1500 now, within 3 months. could be the same this quarter. I think theres practically a 100% chance TSLA will have a positive profit this earnings, but it might be a sell the news event where it moons, and then dumps the next day, whether to either shake out weak hands, or profit taking, or sell the news. I don't think a single person thinks TSLA will have a loss this quarter. I'm pretty sure everyone already knows TSLA will have a profit this quarter, given delivery numbers and elons shenanigans on twitter. options will get fucked (just like NFLX)

P.S. Buy TSLA 2000c, AFTER earnings after the IV crush, not before. Might be a repeat of January where TSLA was $550, beat earnings, went up to $650 the next day, and then traded at 650 flat for a couple of days, before mooning to $900 the week AFTER earnings came out"

 tonight is the night of nights. While many of us have our calls in safe keeping, or leaps to protect from the intraday dips. You will all embark on an adventure that has never been encountered of this magnitude. All the fomoing and bagholding  have trained you for this very day. The bears will be gnawing at any chance to deter your hold, and they will love nothing more than to see the world be brought down in flames and anguish as an increase in pandemic numbers fills their hearts like nothing else in this world. 

Some of you may perish, however history is made by the sacrifice of the courageous and brave few who answer the call, the Tesla call that aims more to just trendies, and chance of 10baggers. But for 10baghers for every fellow man in this world and for a chance for many to be bestowed the everlasting peace of fuck you money.  

The world will be watching you. Cash gang, bull gang, the lame ass roo gang and even the bears themselves. History is upon you. And may god be with you all."

Now buy the dip is ingrained in everybody including big money.  If nothing else they are buying on short term patterns they've established.

I do think it will take a huge psychological shock to the market,  as a financial one (given QE this is almost a given under Trump) is almost forbidden, at least short term.

Thats such a fucking stupid analogy, because i cant sell that fucking farm for a profit, if that mr market guy isnt screaming higher prices

 the market doesnt give a fuck if you think that your farm is undervalued or not, youre here to make money, so might as well buy stocks that the market likes and goes up consistently, even though you think the price of the stock is higher than its fAiR vAlUe (fuck i hate that word so much)

Hypothetical Example: A TSLA $1800 FD is at $4083. You want to get in on a pump for ER or otherwise. Let’s say TSLA goes to $1900 Friday EOD. Your option has now profited $5917, 147%. Nice. And all it cost you was a year’s worth of anxiety in a week. 

Now, instead of that, let’s say you took an equal amount of money and bought 19 1790/1800c debit spreads. If TSLA ends up at 1900, hell, at 1800, you just made $15000 profit. TSLA would have to have reached at least 2000 to match that profitability with your single call. Also, IV crush is essentially nullified with a spread.

If market hours dump after futures climb, buying that dip is a good idea. If futures dump and the market immediately climbs, you probably shouldn’t go along for the ride. If they agree with each other, that’s a solid trend that should not be ignored.

2020-07-22 02:07:16,Daddy_wont_stop,-4,"Dear Diary

So, a lot has happened since my last journal entry.

After Janice and I went to Flaming Man, you could say that my mom was not so pleased. So she and my auntie Nicky decided to teach me a little lesson about being more responsible to get me back on track. But, in spite of her lessons and how she raised me, I discovered a whole new world that week in the desert. I mean, school and science and math and all those things are great too, but what about people, and friends, and living life? I connected with so many great people and had so many great experiences in the desert that I don't think I can go back to being that same nerdy little boy.

Anyways, my mom didn't appreciate the new direction my life had taken, so she tried and tried to get me back into the math club, but it just didn't feel right anymore. My mom was so frustrated with the change in me that she divorced Janice's father, saying Janice was a bad influence on me. So I lost my sister, and my best friend, and my partner in crime all at once. The good news is my mom finally got remarried, and the man she married happens to have a daughter my age named Abella.

So now I have a new stepsister, but what kind of girl is she? She seems pretty shy, but so was I before Janice got me out of my shell. Maybe I could do the same for her."

2020-07-22 01:03:54,BigKahuna82,6,"Rosetta Stone is up 40% since Friday but it’s not even close to being done. The company has a well known undervalued hidden crown jewel EdTech company (Lexia Learning) that is massively missed in the stock price. Lexia has sticky relationships w 15k+ elementary schools and 90%+ retention rate. It’s financially sound and growing but it’s not a momentum ape (e.g nasdaq) so it’s been tossed aside as HF’s need yield MoM and there’s investor attrition.

Lexia teaches kids to read through gamefied software and has 20+ peer reviews and countless awards. If you’re a parent w young kids there’s a good chance you might know the name. Lexia is arguably more effective than human teachers at teaching reading, it’s also arguably solving a world crisis in an incredibly diverse world. Covid is dream scenario for a SaaS edtech company as you probably can imagine (also for the consumer language biz which makes 1/3 of revenues but that is not my focus).

Stock has been in sunken place for 2 years due to attrition but that’s changing fast and will melt up to $30+. Activist investors are pounding fists for an urgent and rigorous sale of assets. A public letter was issued this morning by Voss capital that is very assertive about unlocking the value. The ceo (a former GS banker who should understand investor disdain and valuation) will have a head on a platter and will address this issue on or before august ER. 

Hf’s know this name and will continue to accumulate and hold because Lexia is legit worth that much. A lot of base case estimates w comps on similar assets have this name trading at 50+ and even higher in bull case. $25 calls will print, buy Septembers if you can afford it"

I went to the main Universal park today. No issues. Everyone wearing masks. Hand sanitizer before and after the rides. Everyone maintaining distancing. I feel safer at the park than I do my “non disney”, yet upscale resort.  Resort keeping pool decks safe but once in the water you’re on your own. Unfortunately seems like many at the pool area don’t give a fuck. 

Tomorrow Magic Kingdom, EPCOT the next day and then Hollywood the day after that. Diligence is key but it really is all about personal responsibility. Keep mask on, hands clean. I feel like a test subject but this may be our reality for awhile. I feel like the risk to workers is very low at the parks. Hope you all made tendies today and good luck tomorrow!  Right now I do not think DIS is irresponsible for reopening from what I have seen so far.✌🏼🍀"

TSLA needs one more profitable quarter or the clock resets and has to get three more in a row. Already tweeted “lots to talk about!” On the earnings call which is probably as optimistic as a CEO can get publicly without getting the SEC involved. Does anyone in here really think that they’re going to drop the ball on being profitable when they’ve made record vehicle deliveries already announced? This man will manipulate the accounting, legally, AND maybe drop some wild ass surprise/new factory/new China this and that blah blah blah just to get his SP500 listing. Shit should go parabolic.

Therefore, TSLA will probably become less volatile in the coming future due to more ETFs holding part of the stonk (e.g. SPY or VOO).

Yes, this is good for TSLA to be acknowledged as an important stonk of this meme economy where money printers go brrrr, but TSLA will become more susceptible to general market-wide headwinds because it will be in the hands of more normies with Vanguard and less autists with Robinhood buying TSLA calls.

Step 2: It takes trillions and trillions of continuous printing and stimulus for bulls to undo the bear market. (we are here)  


Step 3: A huge surge in cases and deaths in California, Texas, and Florida results in new stay at home orders. Gold surges, dollar crashes. Powell keeps printing but it isn't enough to keep treasury yields from rising. There's a second leg down in the stock market. Bulls in absolute shambles. Bears make a lot of money initially, but lose it all again foolishly chasing the mythical dragon that is SPY 200p

I assigned a potential degree of correlation / confidence interval based on how many days before/after the ER date to identify unusual activity based on strong independent MSFT action. I also looked at time of day activity and layered in market performance in general on those days and intraday to make sure I was not confusing correlation/causation. I also looked at non ER days / outliers where MSFT had independent unusual activity to see if MCFT correlated on non-ER weeks

2020-07-21 21:49:14,thatguyovertherewait,-19,"Hey guys! Wanted to make a post here to kind of lead some people in the right direction (and that’s whatever direction is right for them).
A few months ago I decided to learn stocks. I watched a ton of videos, made a book describing how to use every indicator, divergences, etc. Essentially, I was training myself to be able to make better educated decisions on where a stock will go considering an “all-equals” market. 
I would tirelessly go on tik tok to find the next best “watchlist,” or follow forums and apply to Tim Sykes and shit lmao. Well; here’s the point!

Every day I’d look at a chart and say “I think it’ll go here” by using technical analysis. I’ve underStood the stock market is literally just a trading zone rn and NOT the long term bull market we know, and that’s awesome bc these chances come very little. But every time I’d make a decision on a stock, I’d come on here and hear everybody say “red day,” “finally bulls get slapped” or even bulls saying the next day is green to mock bears. So I’d get worried and cancel my call assuming someone here knows something I don’t. I’ve come to tell you to STOP looking at this forum because all the stocks that are discussed the most are literal failures. WHY? Because if they hype is THERE then the stock already climbed. Some examples:
AZN two days ago was “too the moon” bc of news? Down almost 4% that day
Microsoft calls? Didn’t make it ppl were too bullish
AAPL 420 call? Too bullish 
Then these watchlists, here’s the trick: 
Pick stocks and out of 5, at least 2 will move just out of law of coincidence. Then the person who makes the watchlist will boast about those and completely IGNORE the literal 20 other stocks they picked for that week. 
Stop listening to hype and trust your gut. Even if you picked an option and the next day dwindles your trust dw.
I bought a call at 115 and the next day the stock dropped to 108 and I almost sold it. Flash forward to Monday and my call went up 300%. 
Make your own decisions and if you see something here that has traction, 9/10x it’s gonna be a bust :/
If you keep listening to hype you’re gonna become a professional at losing money, making emotional decisions, and panic selling. Good luck guys! And thanks for the money JPOW"

It all started when Elon leaked that email about them breaking even. That made people realize that Tesla might have 4 profitable quarters and be in the S&P500. 

So Tesla being profitable is literally priced in.

What isn’t priced in is Elon’s manipulation being bad and Tesla actually not being profitable this quarter.

I’m sure it will be profitable, but if you’re betting on Tesla going up even more after their earnings, you won’t be printing.
