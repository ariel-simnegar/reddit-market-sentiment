I don't care if I lose money, but the emotional swings of you feel for the money of your mother, father, cousin, etc. is amplified. I have a family member's $30k invested in:

&#x200B;

VWINX, KO, VYM, PM, D, PFE, VWOB, XOM, etc.

All relatively safe dividend paying blue chips/funds and my gut churns every red day just for her money. They are older and want a relatively decent income stream to help pay real estate taxes, etc. I know I should just stop looking at it and ride it out, but the stress is real."

Now let me tell you something retard. We have something happening right now it’s very bad it’s called deflation. Tariffs help cause deflation. The fed has no answer for that either. TRUMP CANNOT USE TARIFFS AGAIN! It will irreversibly destroy this economy. It cannot fucking happen so it won’t happen. Thursday gave us a sell off but money didn’t leave the bond market. Friday much bigger selling but didn’t leave the dollar or bonds. Money isn’t rotating it will go back into the stock market. Those two days of selling we got brought down the market so it’s not overbought. No cocksuckas check a chart we are not overbought we are under 60 on the RSI retards.

corona doesn't hurt most people. 

Hospitals are now ready for it. America is ready for it. 

No it's not pretty and won't be. 
Yes. Death is high. 

No it won't disable the country again. People are sick and tired of it and everyone can't wait to go back and go out. 

It will be green there will be a boom for business as people will over compensate for being locked up. 

After a week or two of that boom then reality of slower business will set in. Some will go bankrupt and all that jazz causing markets to bleed down and go sideways. But slowly not dramatically until the feds outway the negative. 

Depending on the worldwide demand and how severe the economy is hurt outside the us. We can recover or reach new highs by end of year. If it's super bad we would be here. 

So now 2800
Can go down to 2100
Recover 2800 plus by end of year.

2020-05-04 02:32:46,AvgJoeCrypto,3,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.

Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.

“There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default,” the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.

A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic."

A few years ago they had sent me a compelling email, that touted some outrageous claims, and quickly deleted.  However, persistence overcomes resistance, and by the the 6th or 7th email, I clicked the link to find out what they are about. 


Wouldn’t YOU be crazy to miss out on the next Amazon?  They correctly called Sirius/XM as the future of music and radio, which helped me go several hundred percent on that initial investment in a 4-5 year span.  You can flame me for putting my money in a custom ETF, made by ME, and endorsed by Motley’s trading desk, but I’ll be damned if I bet against the red white and blue.  Sometimes trading isn’t fair, but I will not trade on FEAR."

2020-05-04 01:12:51,RatoDeserto,-1,"Posted this as a reply to another comment but reposting here for visibility.

Been holding GILD calls since feb (rolling over constantly with a few losses here and there). I shit you not I was green through most of the crash, with some crazy gains on certain days before it all dropped again. The last few weeks I've noticed it start to follow spy occasionally. I hope it gets back to being decoupled from the overall market during this next leg down.

The next few weeks will be filled with world governments negotiating deals with Gilead for the drug. Egypt just did it today and Japan is fasttracking an approval by next week. Remdesivir related searches have also hit top 10 trending in India. The US Army got a deal for 1 million doses back in March and the results have been outstanding.

There was a study released last week that showed prophylactic effects in monkeys. If the alternative delivery solutions for outpatients the CEO talked about on Friday actually come through, these two developments can skyrocket the stock.

Everything I've said can be googled if someone wants to put together a DD."

Financials and Tech. This is what you want to buy on any weakness or in a bear market / market bottom as these sectors tend to do the best in bull markets. You can then sell OTM weeklies to schmucks against these and collect premium to offset any theta. This  will turn your theta from negative to positive. So basically call diagonals on good growth stocks. Maybe throw in a few OTM SPY or QQQ puts 6 months out as a hedge against black swans.

Most businesses (office type) are hypothetically closed probably for 1 year or more voluntarily. Makes sense really. I dont think it would affect stock prices on a whole because the virus is priced in already. Maybe a 5 percent dip and then it will average up and down, up 5%, down 5%, for months to come. The 2nd wave will come on November just before the holidays and it will severely impact consumer spending and there will be a food shortage (and semiconductor shortages).  So I expect stocks reaching yearly highs just before November and then dipping 20 percent and then increasing to levels similar to right now. Until there is a vaccine (or herd immunity), I see that our current way of life is the new norm."

&#x200B;

WSR 5 Put - Sep 2020

\- Holds Texan and Arizona commercial and office real estate.

\- No Canadian snowbirds this year.

\- just go to their website and look at their holdings... they're fucked. (Whitestone REIT)

&#x200B;

DIN 30 Put - Dec 2020

\- shhh.. its a secret

&#x200B;

CSV 25 Call - Oct 2020 (Go for lower call strike if you can afford it... 17.5-20)

\- Held off on earnings for first 2 weeks of May. (Open state orders allowing people to bury the dead starting may 1st) Will be basing Q2  - Q4 numbers off this Q1 2 week period in May during re-opening. 1) They blow away the earnings reports stock rises, 2) They fail and Q2-Q4 outlook looks miserable.... but Q2 will DESTROY earnings with 200k American families burying their dead.

\- Major restructuring at end of 2019 perfectly timed to take advantage of covid

\- Massive amounts of unaccounted dead will keep funerals busy but the panic down. THe more they hide true covid numbers the more funerals keep happening

\- Major manipulation of stock over past 2 months

\- CEO owned a bank, head of an Insurance company... Board of officers sold stock 5-7 days before crash. Started buying back in. They're hooked up. Blackrock owns 8%.

&#x200B;

ITA Calls... but they're expensive.

&#x200B;

This week:

Buy ITA/RTX other war stocks every dip down of $5 to $10 based on stock ATH. (yea not an option, bitch bitch while I make tendies as you guys distract the population by blowing shit up)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* buy market order puts at open? 
* BTC the shorts and let the long ride out to try to get to at least break even? 
* STO market order call credit spread ATM for the 5/8 expiration?
* All of the above?

“Futures always recover, this doesn’t mean shit. Trump or the Fed will just announce something that will save the market.”

Be careful. This is EXACTLY how big money beats you. This is what a bear market rally looks like every time. When everyone and their mother is saying “just buy the dip, economic reality doesn’t matter” is when big money stops buying the dip with you. Meanwhile they’ve been building their short positions and will take you for all you’re worth while you keep buying the dip because “it always works.” 

Then, when you’re finally out of money and giving up, they use all that money to invest at the true bottom. This is why Buffet has waited this whole time. It’s not his first rodeo."

Green Day:
1. More states opening
2. Gilead remdesivir that is FDA approved for use. 
3. Quantitative easing pump for monday
4. Rates of new infections dropping across most states. 

Red day:
1. Businesses still shuttered and no one visiting to buy from them. 
2. Buffets comments 


My own observations. Traveling into MSP for the weekend and seeing so many people out compared to few weeks ago. The great weather and overall neutral to positive news over weekend pointing towards a flat to Green Day tomorrow. I spoke to couple of the AMZN delivery vans today and they are telling me their delivery routes are increasing by 25 percent over Th e past week and they just hired 100 people since Friday. I am holding $AMZN calls and that was reassuring."

2020-05-03 22:00:00,SolitaryEgg,1,"Bulls really dont get it.

The rally only existed due to the fed.

The fed doesn't actually give a shit about the economy. They give a shit about saving banks and CEOs and hedge funds, which they already did. Their profits are saved and locked in cash.

The fed isn't going to bukkake the market again.

I honestly feel bad for the bulls who honestly think the fed cares about their RH account. The current fed are unironic classical economists, and they believe the hedge funds and banks will trickle wealth down to you.

They might dump another cumload closer to the election, but they aren't going to do it now."

2020-05-03 21:54:07,Edward_Quince,2,Just don’t see any news that comes out between now and September that puts us in bull market territory. May and June will probably bounce around $260 to $280 in the absence of any meaningful earnings data or guidance. I don’t think anyone is truly appreciating how bad Q2 earnings will be. Q1 year over year earning average is at -15% across those who have reported. That conservatively factors in roughly one month of quarantine if states were aggressive in implementing lockdowns in early March. One whole month. Q2 is going to be a bloodbath with a full quarter of lockdown activity.

And same with Microsoft and Amazon

Apple and Tesla are worst hit due to pandemic 

And can go back to $148 and $185 levels in coming weeks and months and also drive Nasdaq  Dow and S&P to signifantly Lower

People have short memory

My gut tells me that we will see another attempt at a media pump from the administration with the touting of remdesivir and reopening states resulting in another short term rally. I know a lot of that is ""priced in"" but I have been seeing way too many positive responses to shit that I have considered ""priced in"".  I have 5/4 and 5/15 spy calls at 283 that I'm going to ditch if we go below 281 tomorrow or at open and I'm going to buy puts even if they have expensive premiums looking for a fall to the 275 range. If we climb I'm going to sell my calls when SPY hits 290 and look for another downtrend to buy puts for a big fall towards 272. I believe if we go past 272 without much resistance we will see another series of very red days.

Coronavirus cases: Dipped down over the weekend compared to Friday, but deaths are not necessarily down too much. Many states still not convinced in reopening efforts, including New York and NorCal.

Korean Leader Kim Jung Un still alive - although this was late Friday

Stimulus - Phase 4 delayed currently it seems? Although there are talks of phase 4 which is focusing not on saving businesses but expanding (?)

Chinese Tariffs - Caused large sell-off friday along with tech stock crashes? Trump to speak more on this 7pm...

European countries, most notably France slightly lowering restrictions.

Warren Buffett - Sells airlines stocks, said something about ""American Magic.""

Middle East Stock exchanges crash hard -4% overall.

I don't know if that's bearish or bullish so fill in what other news you know other than this and try to predict things \^\^

&#x200B;

Some bonus TA Analysis: Stocks usually are red 88% of the time on Monday after a red Friday in the past 10 years of the SPY (I'm not sure if its 5 or 10 years). But there hasn't been 3 consecutive red days since March 3rd."

2020-05-03 20:50:07,,54,"I saw Warren Buffet a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and disagree with him about airlines.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Diet Cokes in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the cans and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each can and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Anyone else had any experiences like this with Warren and airlines?"
