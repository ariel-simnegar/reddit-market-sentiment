Let’s just remember... economy is still shit. 1 in 5 eligible workers still unemployed. Stimulus isn’t going to pay middle class to keep gambling on the stock market. So some people will go back to work, economy will begin to recover, and you all will wonder why things are tanking, when in reality the market will just correct to something more reasonably forward looking.

Did you guys know that the $600/week unemployment boost represents a bigger stimulus in dollars than the 2009 stimulus at its peak? Imagine the carnage when that suddenly goes away.  


TL;DR Congress needs to pass a substantial stimulus bill ASAP, and it needs to keep at least half of the unemployment boost or else we're fucked and so is the market."

It could mean jail.
It could mean derision.
It could mean mockery — isolation.
Isolation is the gift.
All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.
And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.
And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.
If you’re going to try, go all the way.
There is no other feeling like that.
You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.
You will ride life straight to perfect laughter.

The market can AT BEST melt-up, so rolling weekly short puts can offset incremental gains, but if a drop does occur you double the profit on the short position. And I can't see it being a huge drop either. Which, even if it was a big drop, you're back in cash gang after the short-term short puts get executed and you buy back the short shares. Yeah, maybe you don't cash in on the full rug-pull, but you just buy in long and ride the next wave up. Rinse, repeat."

If introduced, sanctions would stop Nokia and Ericsson from exporting products manufactured in China to other countries, the report read, while also stating that Beijing would reach for those actions only as a ""worst-case scenario.""

The Chinese government took a strong stance against the United Kingdom's decision to ban Huawei from its 5G network, describing it as a sign that the UK ""lost its independence"" to the United States.

Announcement: "" **The Phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial called SG016 recruited 101 patients from 9 specialists sites in the UK during the period 30 March to 27 May 2020 and found that patients receiving SNG001 had a 79% lower risk of developing severe disease compared to placebo and additionally that patients who received SNG001 were more than twice as likely to recover from COVID-19 as those on placebo.** "".

However, if you look at their study in detail: ""**Patients who received SNG001 were more than twice as likely to recover (defined as ‘no limitation of activities’ or ‘no clinical or virological evidence of infection’) over the course of the treatment period compared to those receiving placebo (HR 2.19 \[95% CI 1.03-4.69\]; p=0.043).** "". Barely statistical significance = basically means it shows lack of statistical strength.

Also: **""Three subjects (6%) died after being randomised to placebo. There were no deaths among subjects treated with SNG001.** Basically this can be attributed completely due to randomness since sample is 101.

Also: ""**Furthermore, patients receiving SNG001 appeared to be more than twice as likely to have recovered by the end of the treatment period (HR 2.60 \[95% CI 0.95-7.07\]; p=0.062), although this strong trend did not reach statistical significance.** ""

Basically what we have here is NOTHING more than a small clinical studie that happens to show significance in some parts without making strong claims or showing results better than anything we already have(remdisivir). Im shorting this cause it clearly isn't improving shit."

For anyone who thinks retail stimmy/unemployment has ""no power in moving the market"" here's this,

people have been getting $1109 since the beginning of April. Webull, and many other brokers leverage you up 4x buying power. That's nearly 4500 of buying power added into your account every week. There are nearly 20 million people collecting unemployment. Multiply that 20m by 4500, then multiply that by the week. Granted not every single dollar goes into the market, but there is data that proves a massive surge in new retail accounts.

 July 31st can be the abomination of our economy and the market."

2020-07-20 07:44:16,TheCryptoDeity,16,"Watch this the market about to take all these fools money

At first we open red, then bulls will close and take the L bc they think itll keep going down and bears will stay open bc they're in profits and agree with bulls that it should go down. 

Then itll go up because short interest is too high, and then bears will hit stop losses to keep some profits but compared to earlier gains theyll feel like shit

Then when bulls see long volume increasing as bear stop losses close, theyll go long. 

Then cuz long interest is so high, itll go back down, and cuz this time 75% of the bears have fuked off itll just drill past the open and liquidate bulls. 

Then bears will wake up, and see it lower than when they stopped out and even lower than the daily open, Theyll get fomo and put the fuck out of everything. 

Now bulls are broke and short interest is really high = monster rally. Bears get delta crushed 

Then, after absolutely obliterating retail leverage, and absorbing all those sweet, sweet tendies... itll hit another extended hours ath right before the feds regularly scheduled debt market nonconsensual penetration and injection, pumping it up even higher.

Now the following happens: Italy's house is on fire. Like, badly. It needs money to repair and to pay the firemen to extinguish the fire.

Other houses are happy to help, but they do want Italy to make some promises, like installing smoke detectors and some other preventative measures

People are missing so much on this AZN play it makes me worried that WSB got played.

1 - EVERYONE knows that this report is coming out.

2 - People try to compare this to Moderna (30-40b market cap) and NVAX (8 billion MC) AZN is a LARGE drugmaker. They aren't going to to react pricewise the same way that the others did.

3. The minute this gets approved, the government is nationalizing the patent and aint paying shit. Promise that.

4. Might not even be effective.

5.AZN today rose because ALL biotech and pharma rose.

I really think some people here COULD get fleeced. And you KNOW they went all in too.

There is a positive relation between interest rates and preceding long-term inflation rates most of the time (make sense, Fed is reactive) but there appears to be **PRACTICALLY NO RELATION BETWEEN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND FUTURE LONG-TERM INFLATION**

The fluctuations in yields in the long term bond market cannot be well described as resulting from information about future inflation, nor are they well defined as resulting from future short-term interest rates. It’s purely speculative.

**The bond market has been very unsuccessful in predicting the future.**

2020-07-20 06:25:55,Throwawayeconboi,12,"Let me explain the current Futures movement for everyone curious:


Traders are uncertain. When uncertain, don’t buy. You sell or wait, so therefore we get this red-flat thing where futures drop from some selling and then stay there, and rinse and repeat. This happens until the awaited news is released.


Now, here’s the gameplan. AstroZeneca should be releasing their report soon. Once that is done, we see what happens. If it’s not good or it doesn’t pump the market, there is still something else to watch out for....


...the Senators are BACK from recess. Prepare for CNBC and WSJ headlines about “ongoing stimulus talks” tomorrow."

2020-07-20 06:18:41,CptTonyStark,10,"The Effect of the Bond Market on Stock Market

1.	Short term interest rates: Rates on loans and bills for <1yr
2.	Long term interest rates: Rates on bonds, mortgages, loans extending decades

Prices of long term bonds move opposite long term interest rates; when long term interest rates fall, prices of still outstanding previously issued long term bonds rise.

The Fed can easily control the short term interest rate, but long term interest rates are more speculative and dependent on things that central banks can’t control today. The Fed uses QE to try to influence long term interest rates. 

The monetary policy report of 1997 (The FED Model) showed a notable correlation between the 10 yr bond yield and P/E ratio since 1982. Between mid 60s and early 80s, interest rates were rising and P/E ratios were falling, and vice versa between early 80s and late 90s. However, this didn’t hold true during the Great Depression when both interest rates and P/E ratios were unusually low and didn’t hold true in early 2000s when both interest rates and P/E ratios were declining.

**STOCK PRICES DO NOT SHOW ANY SIMPLE OR CONSISTENT RELATION WITH INTEREST RATES**

Still, investors looking at very high P/E ratios when long term government bond yields are very low will not be as discouraged as investing in stocks, as all the alternatives are poor."

2020-07-20 05:59:32,CptTonyStark,9,"Apart from the the dot com bubble and the bull market of late 2010s, the only times P/E ratios > 25 have been observed are: June 1901 (25.2), September 1929 (32.6), and Jan 1966 (24.1). This is what happened afterwards:

1.	Prices bounced around the June 1901 level for a decade, eventually falling 67% by June 1920 due to WWI.
2.	The inflation adjusted S&P index fell 80.6% between Sept 1929 and June 1932, eventually recovering by December 1958 following the post war boom.
3.	Prices bounced around the Jan 1966 level till 1968, then fell 56% by December 1974, and didn’t regain their level till May 1992.

But ofc, you could have made the same argument 5 years ago, and missed out. IMO, P/E ratios represent hope for the future, which is different for each company. The exponential growth inherent in tech has naturally made people more hopeful about their future and some of that hope is being justified recently with companies like AMZN, TSLA, etc. finally turning a profit after decades of losses and still funneling all their profits back into R&D for more growth."

T cells are particularly important in long lasting immunity..antigen specific T cells can quickly sense any viral infection and act efficiently to eliminate. B cells = antibodies..and if they show memory B cell activation, it would circumvent the whole issue of waning immunity as well. Memory B cells only produce antibodies if a virus re infects..so the whole antibody waning thing is rubbish because you are literally looking for antibodies in a person that is not infected at the time."

2020 Risk-free interest rate = 0.8%

Average expected term (years)  = 7 .0

Expected volatility = 55.0%    !!!

Dividend yield = N/A (BYND has no div).

In other words, they are using a BS model volatility of 55% to value their employees stock options. Retard translation = the company themselves know its a very risky stock. Personally I don't think that risk is to the upside though on those stock options!!"

2020-07-20 03:34:25,sofarsogood84,10,"Expecting BYND to keep dropping this week:

&#x200B;

This company seems to be timing market releases just when the stock starts to drop or when analysts downgrade, on a weekly basis it seems! Analyst downgrade => We bought a factory in Europe. Price Drop > = We are selling in China/Brazil/ trying to convince KFC or McD's that our product is scalable and popular at the same time hoping they won't just make a similar offering themselves for cheaper. Another price drop > = we are releasing a discount pack etc etc 

&#x200B;

In other words, not only is it a marketing company masquerading as a tech company, it's pumping both the product and the stock to investors. The thing is, investors aren't really buying the pump anymore - after you announce your retailing in China and the stock doesn't rally you know that they have played all their pump cards. 

&#x200B;

Also they have get a significant proportion of their revenue from restaurants and eat out places:

last quarter numbers US \~31% was from restaurants, International: \~75%, with the remaining 25% from the grocer. If this seems unbelievable see from their recent quarterly SEC filing:

&#x200B;

[https://investors.beyondmeat.com/static-files/09168b25-bd3c-4279-8397-6b06ab7782c0](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/static-files/09168b25-bd3c-4279-8397-6b06ab7782c0)

(page 9)

&#x200B;

Thing is of course COVID will likely significantly reduce those restaurant revenue, or at least limit the growth. People buying now for the earnings in a week or two must be praying that the retail/grocer number can make up for this loss.  

&#x200B;

I'm expecting a net loss of more than 2c/share , and further decline in already negative operating cashflow."

Now, the Oxford vaccine team plans to start tests on volunteers who will be intentionally exposed to the virus in a “challenge trial,” which has been deemed controversial since there is still no approved drug to combat the infection.

In challenge trials, the volunteers recruited are healthy and without any underlying health condition. These volunteers are intentionally exposed to the pathogen in a controlled laboratory setting, which means it can be finished in weeks and requires fewer people than other types of trials.

2020-07-20 02:52:02,Greenjuggleguy,2,"Here's my personal thoughts for the week.

AAPL - Been in strong uptrend since mid-May. Calls printed last week on Monday, but premium got killed due to chop.
MSFT - Earnings on 7/22. Trending down now, nearing the 198 support level. May go long if we hit that level
INTC - Earnings on 7/23. Hitting $60 resistance. If it breaks level, and has good numbers on ER then stock could go to $65
PTON - Broke a month long uptrend, stock came down about 16% since last week. Got stopped out on calls, but premiums are super cheap because of chop this past week. Would definitely go long here. Earnings on 8/12."

My resort does not really care about sanitizing. that’s concerning. I’ll need to remain diligent which I had already planned. 

Roads are absolutely dead. Saw several cars that looked lived in while driving here on interstates. Sad.  No slow going even with construction around Disney proper or getting here from 95. Tomorrow heading to Universal. Will let you know how it is there. There are def issues with money and staffing all around my resort. Starting to wonder if these places will make it. This place was closed for three months according to the staff at check in. I’ve been to Disney and Orlando a lot in my life. It’s kind of sad to see little to no vibrancy. Sorry for long report."

3.	**People who take big risks that they’re unaware of and cause widespread damage must not be allowed to repeat it:** 2008. Enough said.
4.	**Make sure everyone’s incentives are aligned:** Asymmetrical incentives - all rewards and no punishment leads to unnecessary risk taking.
5.	**Compensate complexity with simplicity:** Complexity from globalization and highly networked economic life needs to be balanced by simplicity in financial products. The complex global economy is already a form of leverage. Complex systems survive due to redundancy, not optimization and debt."

2020-07-20 01:38:03,CptTonyStark,6,"How to deal with Complex feedback loops where very low probability events can have huge payoffs?

1.	**Respect time and nondemonstrative knowledge:** things that have worked well for a very long time in a complex system are preferable, don’t mess with things you don’t understand fully and cant predict precisely.
2.	**Avoid overoptimization, love redundancy:** Redundancy is the opposite of debt, one can buy insurance etc. to become more robust. Overspecialization is not a good idea in complex systems with nasty feedback loops. 
3.	**Avoid prediction of small probability payoffs:** Payoffs from remotely probably events are almost impossible to predict. 
4.	**Beware of the atypical nature of remotely probable events.:** Past shortfalls don’t predict future shortfalls, stress tests don’t work because we don’t know exactly what to stress test for.
5.	**Set up the correct incentive structure:** Don’t reward people who are oblivious to the risks they’re taking and destroys someone’s trust.
6.	**Avoid some risk metrics:** Conventional metrics like the Gaussian, linear regression, sharpe ratio, ANOVA, least squares, Markowitz optimal portfolio, etc. don’t work for large deviations.
7.	**Be aware if the payoff will be positive or negative:** Low probability events that have highly negative payoffs are more important.
8.	**Do not confuse absence of volatility with absence of risk:** Just because there’s low volatility doesn’t mean you’re insulated against risks from low probability events.
9.	**Beware of how risk is quantified and presented:** Humans have several mental biases and systematic psychological errors that depend on how risk is described."

1.	Great degree of independence b/w its elements 
2.	Temporal dependence (variables depend on their past value)
3.	Horizontal dependence (variables depend on each other)
4.	Diagonal dependence (variable A depends on the past history of variable B)

As a result of this interdependence, mechanisms are subject to positive, reinforcing feedback loops, which causes extreme concentration of payoffs among players. The nonlinearities accentuate inequality and increases unpredictability."

Getting comfortable w/ the Streetsmart Edge UI for options.  Need to make sure I understand how Schwab handles closing such orders, or what happens if i hold til expiry since my practice has always been w/ long calls closing early.

Dumb question for a spread noob:  Lets say I open a vertical spread on an expensive underlying such as TSLA, and am conservative and buy and sell both ITM therefore driving the price of the contracts even higher.  Lets say for example 8/28 buy $1300 and sell $1350, 

Total cost to buy $31K and total sell at 28K with an entry cost of $3K.   If I open as a vertical spread, do I need the cash to cover the $31K or just the $3K?"

They are resembling the path FB took post IPO, until people finally realized the potential. Their DAU has been growing month over a month (and could see a surge internationally in places like India who have banned tiktok), and ad revenue and average revenue per user continues to increase. Q1 numbers: DAU increased by 20%; Q1 revenue up 44% compared to Q1 2019 39%, and posted its first ever + op cash flow. Currently up almost 200% over the last three months.

""*Snap has slowly improved its ad-based offerings and marketers are now falling in love with what it calls an “unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience.” The social media company that still refers to itself as “a camera company” claims that in the U.S. it reaches “more than 90% of 13 to 24 year-olds and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year-olds*.” [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-snap-stock-earnings-coronavirus-233311765.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-snap-stock-earnings-coronavirus-233311765.html)

Their dynamic advertising platform is unique and still flying under the radar. They have the foothold in AR technology, lenses, and are a leader in creative advertising options such as first viewed ad upon open or designing ads for several campaigns which has been made easy through their app integrations. Market sentiment on SNAP has always been shitty due to FB and twitter, but I think they recovered beautifully and have positioned themselves extremely well."

The government's fourth stimulus package is expected to include and focus on education funding and school reopenings in the fall, liability protection, an increase in funds for coronavirus testing and vaccine research and development, another round of relief from the Paycheck Protection Program and a payroll tax cut, the sources explained. McConnell's proposal does not cover financial aid to state and local governments, according to the report.


After the congressional Republicans release their bill, negotiations between them and the Democrats are expected to quickly ensue, with July 31, the recess start date for the House of Representatives looming.

2020-07-19 23:22:57,Leucadian,3,"Honest feedback appreciated*

I'm deeply short on DIS with puts (15k) that expire on Friday 7/24, currently down 60% on them, however I have weathered the TSLA rollercoaster so I know what it's like to be down 90% and then up 300% in a day...

I am not doubting my vibe on the fact that DIS is treading on thin ice and the inevitable drop is right around the corner... With that being said I would like some opinions regarding whether I should take the 60% loss and roll my position into a later date or hold because this may just be the week the mouse eats shit. 

Thank you!"

I’ve been saying this for a month now..their vaccine tech is supposed to be highly immunogenic (moreso than mRNA) and can stimulate both B and T cells (which provide long lasting immunity). That and they will have a much larger sample size and rumor is that it’s safe with no major side effects. Also one of their primary endpoints for their trials was to track the ppl who were vaccinated and see if they ever develop Covid..if they show data on that, game over boys. 

The only thing that might fuck AZN call holders over is that they have a massive mkt cap and may not gap up in the short term to satisfy far OTM calls in the short term. But future wise? They have potential to being the top pharmaceutical company in the world..covid aside, their therapeutic pipeline is jacked. 

Don’t miss out on playing their earnings end of the month. A month ago in the ASCO conference (American society of clinical oncology), they showed breakthrough data on their drug Tegrisso that blew away the standard of care treatment for lung cancer. Something like 90% 5 yr survival vs sub 40%...that drug alone is expected to generate billions of revenue if its adopted as the new standard of care. They also have several other drugs for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and have been one of the leading companies in the immunotherapy market which is on fire right now. 

AZN is getting attention for covid right now but believe it or not, the future for that company is bright af. Buy leaps..im talking 2021 and 2022 calls..or even shares if that’s your thing"

Market caps are nearly identical.  Molson-Coors (also includes Miller brands) is down 30% from pre COVID while Boston Beer is up 55%.  Why such a large difference within the same sector? 

I worked in sales for a Miller-Coors distributor for some time.  The profit margin on barrels/tap beer is 40% higher than canned/bottled beer.  That accounts for some of the dip, but it makes sense to assume canned/bottled beer sales are way up, even if the premium brands took a hit and people are drinking budget brands (keystone, Milwaukee’s Best, etc...).  

Yes, options volume sucks, I know, but I’m thinking there has to be a play here."

Ideal plays for me have been buying dips 2-3 days before earnings and then selling cash covered calls with strike at the cost basis. The only times i have been disappointed has been wishing I set the strike higher, but hey that's the nature of my game. I am happy to take shares off people who are scared and give them back with a relatively small profit. Lot of fear in the markets right now.

Caveat is that I am fairly selective about what I will play this on. I didn't get into netflix call it luck or skill but anyone who tried this on netflix would probably not be happy. My best plays were banks and XLF which I killed on. I have also been killing on Southwest airlines every week the delta at the money is too high IMO. But you guys do you."

If you are looking for a smart bike:

[https://tacx.com/product/neo-bike-smart/](https://tacx.com/product/neo-bike-smart/)

Why this one, well, doesn't have to be, it could also be Wahoo Kickr Bike or StagesBike...the main thing is get a real smart bike - not one that you crank the resistance by hand, or one that estimates power based on cadence and speed (that power is so inaccurate that when someday you ride against real cyclists, you will be in for the disappointment of your life).    Dumb bikes like the peleton are  worthless for real training.

All smart bikes feature +/-2.0% power accuracy and smart control of the bikes resistance, ERG mode and compatibility with real training apps like TrainerRoad and Zwift.  This allows someone looking for race level fitness to train to power.  \*never\* consider a peleton, which is not a smart bike.  That's a company selling sizzle not real tech."
