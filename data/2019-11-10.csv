As you all know, trading options on the stock market can be very difficult. But with a little bit of practice, even the most clueless beginners can learn to be profitable.

The only problem is, not everyone has thousands of dollars to throw away at their disposal.

This official petition guarantees the establishment of a NEW paper trading competition between new users and under-privileged traders, where you can trade using fake money, or, “paper trades.”
