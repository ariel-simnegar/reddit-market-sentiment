The first crash was because people didn't know whether there was a giant depression coming and the company would be able to survive it. So people sold off companies which would be affected, including hotels, airlines and Tesla. 

Since then the government has made it extremely clear that they will buy the shit out of any debt and not dilute common equity. That fear is now out of the market. What could possibly make it go down again? Lower earnings for the year have already been discounted and now what's fueling the rally is the ""greater sucker"" effect, where everyone thinks that by buying today at $X they can sell tomorrow at $X+100.

JPow's remarks today.

Powell said this was the case today (from his Q&A):

> These programs we are using, under the laws, we do these, as I mentioned in my remarks, **with the consent of the Treasury Secretary** and the fiscal backing from the congress through the Treasury. And we are doing it to provide credit to households, businesses, state and local governments. As we are directed by the Congress. We are using that fiscal backstop to absorb any losses we have.

> Our ability is limited by the law. **We have to find unusual, and exigent circumstances and the Treasury Secretary has to agree**, and we are using this fiscal backstop. **There is really no limit on how much of that we can do** other than meet the tests under the law as amended by Dodd-Frank.

That is saying the US President is in control of the money printer for any circumstances that he feels necessary.  

Next stop: Limit the Treasury.

Is this because it’s not exactly a liquidity problem but more of a uncertain problem that could go to a liquidity problem?

2020-04-10 05:45:24,MsiKing23,4,"Ok this might sound crazy but it's just a thought, What if this is just a synthetic market...because of the media?its just a gut instinct but What if they are just using consumer sentiment on the split between bulls,and bears and say they are pumping a absurd amount of money, but just pump a little bit and let psychology take over. For example what I would call Fomo. Every one wants to hop on the new wave on a volatile market.I think There might be more bulls right now But for every 6 bulls there's one 🌈🐻 betting just as much as the bulls. So it only creates an illusion that the market will remain bullish, but actually it's going to just stay stagnating slightly up at first and they will pull the rug, and it will cause a sustainable loop because, then the bulls will just start betting more because they think a pump is coming and they are sure of it.until the government figures out how to adapt to our new problems, with a treatment or some new work laws until we get a vaccine. The market will not come crashing down and I'm sure of it. Because we are just being manipulated at this point. Now call me retarded plz"

We saw this as evident when all of these CEOs and politicians sold their positions and stepped down in October before the big crash hit.  Who is behind it?  The WHO is behind it.

Never in any past pandemics have we seen a market drop this low.  And never have we seen a recession instigated by a globalist organization's guidance.

If lizard people are selling their stock before a crash, they are most likely selling calls too in the hopes of banking on a shit ton of premium, etc.  It is insider trading used to rob the retail traders.

They can conduct and pay for a bearish sentiment in the media, deliver premature statistics to paint a fear-rich reality.

The WHO is a globalist organizations.  China is a huge influence in the WHO and the Media. Globalists don't like Trump.  And who's holding them accountable, and why is bearishness due to a ""highly deadly"" (even though it's not) virus the fault of America's businesses?

Trump can not stop the WHO, and their international partners, from doing their own bidding, but he can pump the economy.  It may seem irresponsible, but there is a lot of money to be made from selling puts and short covering.  Especially if those with money have the arrogant and presumptuous notion that Americans trust the media in spite of explicit pumping.

Basically printing money isn't as bad as shutting down all businesses in America, and the Powell pump is a punishment for the globalists and hypnotized public that you can profit on."

2020-04-10 04:25:16,redditor_xxx,3,This week I had the strange feeling that whatever move I make the market goes against me. On Tuesday I decided to YOLO my account in ABR shares. They were rising premarket. The moment I bought they started to fall. I closed my position at -$2K. On the next day they were +20% up. Then I decided to short SPX because it was slightly falling and I was hoping that the correction is starting and this rally is insane and beyond any reasoning. The moment I shorted it started to climb. I was watching how my account is bleeding and after a several thousand loss I closed my position. Seconds later it turns into my direction and it even passed my opening price.  Then I said fuck you and made more shitty trades and finished the day at -$6K.
2020-04-10 04:24:25,cinemagical414,12,"The market is still behaving as though we will be able to reopen the economy in 1-2 months and quickly climb out of the hole we've been in. That completely defies all logic. 25% unemployment doesn't magically revert back down to 5% when you end social distancing. The countless businesses that have closed and will continue to close do not magically open back up. Rent, mortgage, credit & loan payments that have been piling up -- they don't suddenly disappear. And the massive dip we've experienced in GDP -- a dip that keeps dipping further down -- we don't ever get that back.

Then there's the huge problem of trade. Our supply chains are fragmented and globalized. Unless our trading partners have also recovered, imports and exports will continue to lag. Trade may also be *dangerous* with the continuous risk of further virus spread.

And oh yeah, about that virus. We do not beat this thing unless one of the following happens:

1. We develop a vaccine & administer it to a sufficient percentage of the at-risk population. This is a 12 month project to make the vaccine + 12 months to manufacture, distribute & administer.
2. We develop or discover an extremely effective therapeutic option that either treats the virus or works as a prophylactic. Some drugs in the testing pipeline are promising in terms of their ability to modestly improve the odds of survival among the sickest patients, but otherwise we have little to be excited about here. (And no, Trump's hydroxychloroquine obsession does not translate to clinical efficacy.)
3. We implement a robust ""test & trace"" system that involves closely monitoring the symptoms of \*everyone,\* quarantining anyone suspected of having the virus & testing them very quickly to confirm, and then rounding up anyone who came into contact with confirmed patients, to quarantine & quickly test them (and then continuing to follow the trail of those who were in close contact with anyone who tests positive). This is a pipe-dream at this point. We haven't even been able to roll out enough tests to confirm a diagnosis in people who are on their deathbeds. We are far below the testing rates of nations who have much more successfully managed the virus like South Korea & Germany. The notion that we could roll out enough tests for a ""test & trace"" strategy, as well as the processes required to implement such a program -- it's a laughable notion.
4. We develop & roll-out an antibody test that confirms who has recovered from covid and would theoretically no longer be able to spread or contract it. This would only be useful in opening up the economy if the number of asymptomatic cases is much higher than most believe it to be. Otherwise, for example, we might be able to send a random assortment of a few hundred thousand people back to work in the entire NYC metro -- or just a single-digit percentage of the workforce. Of course, if it turns out that a shit ton of people had a silent virus and are now immune, that allows us to make more meaningful progress in opening back up. But it's unlikely this is the case.
5. We significantly modify how we live to accommodate the virus until any of the above are implemented, or until the population reaches herd immunity. That means continued social distancing at all times, masks in public, spending most of our time inside. If bars & restaurants reopen, they have to seat fewer people. Office workers might have to stagger or rotate attendance to provide more space for everyone inside. Only 2 people on an elevator. Only 2 people in a taxi. I have no idea what we'd do about buses and subways (though right now NYC appears perfectly fine with letting our supposed essential workers cram together in buses and subway cars). But what I'm describing is not a return to normal life at all, and there will be continued, severe economic consequences in this scenario.

Plus, we do not get back to normal even under all of the scenarios listed above if people do not feel safe being out and about. Even if the threat of the virus is hugely diminished, people will remain hesitant to visit stores and restaurants, stay at work, socialize, and participate in the economy otherwise so long as new cases are being reported. This will also be a huge drag on the economy moving forward.

The market will eventually internalize all of this and plunge once again. It is tricky to predict *when* though. I think we'll start to see signs of investor jitters in the next couple of weeks as Trump begins rolling out plans to reopen the country that will surely be woefully insufficient. And when he then inevitably moves too quickly to reopen the country and the virus begins to spread again, it's all over. Between the banker suicides & plunging stock indices, it will be the bloodiest day on Wall Street by far."

>Another important development occurred this week in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the
original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Officials there lifted the lockdown that had
been in place for 76 days. This is a meaningful milestone. But it also represents the
beginning of a new chapter in this saga, namely one of recovery. And with it come many
questions that are likely to weigh on the minds of most citizens, households, business
owners, investors and government officials. What does life look like after a peak in this
health crisis? Does everything reopen at once? What restrictions, if any, are still needed?

>Will people’s behaviour be any different? Does economic activity bounce back sharply or
gradually? In some ways, this is a concern for another day as we are still in the middle of a serious crisis, where the welfare of our family, friends and clients are top of mind. But these are questions that equity and bond markets will have to grapple with in the not too-distant future.

Corona recovery looks like it will be better than the worst models, but yes requires continued lockdown. Stimulus and fed intervention however ensures that this short term lock down doesn’t leave too far behind where the economy was a year or so ago. Market has no good reason to plummet any more, we aren’t getting more circuit breakers without some big unanticipated news. Even oil has a deal 99% done. Long term effects could be an issue, but I bet we get SPY 290 by this summer and maybe 330 EOY."

If the market dumps big one day (more than 6%), better get rid of your calls, and wait and see how it moves the next day. Will most probably continue dumping."

I get the Fed is trying to help stabalize the markets, but at some point, it can cause inflation.  Then you combine that with the current high unemployment and if that's persistent, that's a recipe for diaster.  Usually, inflation and unemployment are anti-correlated, but it'll be really weird and diastrous if this causes a situation where both are correlated.

The Fed mandate is stable prices and low unemployment and they can accidentally put the US into a possible period of unstable prices and high unemployment (the latter not caused by them though) if they continue to print money.

I think the Fed is banking that the economy and employment comes back before they have to print another 100 trillion though....we'll see how it works out."

I want to explain why I think the HUGE SPY 5/15 240 put position I entered today is probably going to fall. So this is a bull case from a reluctant bear.

Even before the coronavirus shit popped off, everyone knew that the good times were going to come to end. Usually the idea was that JPow was going to end QE and repo operation. If the Fed stopped or even signaled an end to QE and Repo, trust me, before corona, it would've sucked this market dry and presented a huge liquidity issue that would've done terrible thing. Here comes corona and fucks everything. This meant that it was a ***liquidity crunch that defined the March equities sell-off and three different days of circuit breakers.*** The issue is that I think current bears think that corona on it's own will produce the same set of conditions for another drop, but it won't. The liquidity problem has been solved by the FED, or at least temporarily. That means the corona bear case needs another catalyst or de-stabilizer, which it got in the form of Russia backing out of the OPEC deal back in March which sent the markets into circuit breaker mode on that next Monday.

If the liquidity crisis has been solved, which make no mistake was one of the biggest macro issue facing the economy before corona hit, if that problem is solved with JPOW and BRRRR, then corona needs another catalyst. Clearly the recession thesis has, at least, temporarily been debunked, despite whatever TA u/Variation-Separate and [u/scarvesandsuspenders](https://www.reddit.com/user/scarvesandsuspenders/) throw out there. I think the market really thinks that this is a temporary stoppage of an economy that just got thrown trillions of dollars at it.

You won't have a steep downward trend because people aren't scared of a recession anymore, so greed has entered the question. People think this is the bottom. They buy in. If the rug is going to get pulled it need *something* besides just corona. I don't care what the TA says but, to be frank, and I love V-S, he has been wrong for 2 weeks now (at least with his timing). TA is not serious or real enough, though certainly helpful, to predicate the direction of the market, especially in the special circumstances we are in right now.

5/15 240p SPY. But that is based on gut, and a sense that smart people don't believe this rally. Plus WSB has turned bullish which means time to turn bearish. Hook, line, and sinker."

The 2019 prices you are seeing now in the markets does not reflect the accurate valuations of stocks in an economy facing the sharpest declines in GDP since 1942 and the highest unemployment since the great depression. Earnings are going to be abysmal for years to come. Government loans that may stave off bankruptcies in the short term do not equate to corporate profitability. As this reality sets in you can rest assured that these levels will not be maintained. You can't say how long this will take, but I plan to continue selling calls to retard bulls and rolling till they profit."

If you operate anything with people going none of those business are going to start at near 100% capacity.

Think of it this way.  If you have people sit in seats or stand in line it’s absolutely going to open at 50-60% capacity for the foreseeable future to make customers feel safe.  

So sure some stuff might open for summer, but it’ll open at 50% capacity and run that way until a vaccine.

So Q2 0 revenue for those types of businesses.  Q3 35% of pre-pandemic, Q4 50% of pre-pandemic unless second wave hits in Q3.  If we continue then 2021 is Q1 60% pre-pandemic because prices will get raised and you’ll be nickel and dimed to death.  

By Q4 2021 we are back to 80% pre-pandemic."
