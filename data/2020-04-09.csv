The first crash was because people didn't know whether there was a giant depression coming and the company would be able to survive it. So people sold off companies which would be affected, including hotels, airlines and Tesla. 

Since then the government has made it extremely clear that they will buy the shit out of any debt and not dilute common equity. That fear is now out of the market. What could possibly make it go down again? Lower earnings for the year have already been discounted and now what's fueling the rally is the ""greater sucker"" effect, where everyone thinks that by buying today at $X they can sell tomorrow at $X+100.

JPow's remarks today.

Powell said this was the case today (from his Q&A):

> These programs we are using, under the laws, we do these, as I mentioned in my remarks, **with the consent of the Treasury Secretary** and the fiscal backing from the congress through the Treasury. And we are doing it to provide credit to households, businesses, state and local governments. As we are directed by the Congress. We are using that fiscal backstop to absorb any losses we have.

> Our ability is limited by the law. **We have to find unusual, and exigent circumstances and the Treasury Secretary has to agree**, and we are using this fiscal backstop. **There is really no limit on how much of that we can do** other than meet the tests under the law as amended by Dodd-Frank.

That is saying the US President is in control of the money printer for any circumstances that he feels necessary.  

Next stop: Limit the Treasury.
