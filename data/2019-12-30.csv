2019-12-31 05:58:26,TUGBOATCHAMPION,1,"Bit of pullback on $MO today with [vaping flavor ban back on the table](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-30/vaping-flavor-ban-back-on-table-as-fda-hands-trump-new-guidance)

Forwarding this DD on from someone who runs an online store [VaporInABottle](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/ehsf0s/flavored_vaping_ban_is_back_on_the_table/fclezx5/)

>This isn't said in the article, but I have heard from a trustworthy someone who knows more than I do about this, that this proposal will restrict flavors to adult only stores, instead of an out right ban. Is that acceptable? Better than most outcomes. Will the FDA and government stop there? Probably not, but I hope so.

A outright flavor ban isn't going to win trump a single vote. On the other hand, a ban could be the deciding factor for young voters in swing states so close to an election. This is especially the case with a political base like trumps which praises itself on detesting regulation and big government. So I really doubt anything drastic is going to happen as it's not in trump's benefit to do so, regardless of what the FDA suggests.

I'm playing $MO weekly calls hoping to catch a gap up on an official FDA announcement that a complete flavor ban is off the table. I believe even a partial ban such as what was suggested in the DD above is bullish, as it relieves some uncertainty on juul. 

If I get fucked and this stock goes anywhere near $45 again I'm loading up on LEAPs and riding them until the election."
