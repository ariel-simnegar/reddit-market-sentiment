Many people said that Apple would be a bellwether of the market. I'll admit that the last time we saw futures this red that I became fearful. I adjusted my positions down and thought that things had taken a turn for the worst. It was emotional decision making. It resulted in losses that I recovered from but only to bring myself to break even. 

This time I plan to be more methodical and take advantage of the reaction. I'm considering this an opportunity for redemption. Good luck out there."

You read the report on the titanium plant that was BACK OPEN but 2 bros got the corona and they shut it back down. Pro tip: that is going to happen everywhere. 

Apple releasing the guidance isn't itself a huge deal but if they can't motivate the factory back into existence then imagine who the fuck is gonna be able to? AAPL is more powerful than most countries on this planet, and keep in mind this is only the beginning.

I posted this question like around 20 mins ago, and some nice people here gave me an answer, so just please consider if you are accounting for the Sunday-Monday moves (which was around +0.2%).  [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) is actually accounting for the Sunday-Monday moves, so when it says it's down -0.2% right now, it actually means it's down -0.2% from Friday close to current.  As in it's up +0.2% from Friday close-Monday and -0.4% from Monday close-current for the roughly -0.2% from Friday close-current.

Anyways, the best answer really is futures at this point is actually completely relevant.  Furthermore, if you own individual stocks, you can easily see a situation where MSFT isn't really down but AAPL down -3%, so wait until pre-market."

It’s not free money, those obscenely higher daily amounts loaned out are maturing now at a faster rate than new repo is funneling in.  Tapering down = it’s practically over. Perfect timing for this bubble to pop with this virus shutting down China and no repo to back it up.

But if the market starts tanking I’m sure Powell will go full blown repo again because he’s the worst fed chairman we’ve ever had in history and thinks these band aids aren’t going to explode with future consequences.

If anything if it wasn't priced in stocks would have been much higher. Don't even ask the question ever again. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).
