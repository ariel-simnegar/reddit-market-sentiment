Now, the Rona is looking pretty bad and idk where we're gonna be when June rolls around. Maybe it moves fast like a wildfire but chances are its gonna drag on and still be a problem.

Plan: I know they offer refunds if there is a death in the family. All I have to do is just look in the obituary, find someone who died, don't they generally list the funeral parlor or some shit? Last time I talked to Delta about a refund they asked for the phone number. Idk if htey actually called it, but I don't want to bluff on this. So I find out a recently dead person, see where the funeral is being held, and just use their name and the funeral parlor number.

Boom, trip refunded, no bullshit. Right?"

$SQ 85c 4/17 and 85c 6/19:
Will hold right up until earnings. I‚Äôm not optimistic about earnings for SQ given recent misses. I could be wrong though and will leave in the 6/19 calls in and see what happens. EDIT: Ignore misses clause. Meant to say weirdly averaging flat over the last year despite beats.
 
$AMD 57.5c 4/15 and 60c 5/15: Still confident  that we‚Äôll see 60 before these strike dates despite downgrade today.

$ACM 55c 3/20: Just following DD of another autist here. Recent price action and rumors of acquisition. This is basically a gamble on my end. DD: https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6xgj6/for_those_asking_since_i_called_some_good_moves/.

$TAN 43c 3/20 & $VSLR 13c 3/20: $FSLR bomb today probably has all of solar spooked. Strikes are still out a month. Planning to hold and pray these don‚Äôt go to hell. 

$SPYG 47c 3/20: Got these today for super cheap., $0.05 or so. With market recovery from the dip today I feel this should be ITM by strike date.

$TGT 140c 3/20: Another copied trade. Price action looks good. Not expecting to hit 140c but would be happy with some small tendies from
this before earnings. I‚Äôm not optimistic about any brick and mortar retail doing well over the holidays especially with WMT's miss.

I don't have enough knowledge to quantify the effects of retail investors/boomers like that, but something to look out for. I know a lot of us don't think about that (every single one of my trades over 4 years has been taxed as short term gains), but it's a big deal."

I was thinking about writing a covered call for Jan 15, 2021 at a strike of 220.

The premium on this would be $20 so i would immediately collect $2,000. So my question is, if in 2 weeks facebook reaches a stock price of 220, can I close my position for free collect my 220 x 100 shares = 22k and keep my 2k premium rinse and repeat buying something else?

I feel like this is too easy.. as if I plan to hold onto my 100 shares no matter what happens in the market I have the same risk of my shares going to zero. The only difference is I miss the upside potential but then again I can just immediately re-buy the same 100 shares at a 220.50 stock price and still have profited my premium. Whats the catch?

the official increase in new cases slowed dramatically as the authorities once again changed the diagnostic criteria. The change of course sparked suspicion of more fiddling with the data, but it may also be a legitimate move now that they have more testing capacity.

However, watch what the officials do, not what they say. Two unmistakable signs the Party thinks victory really is at hand will be:

1. Xi visits Wuhan;
2. The announcement of a date for the ‚ÄúTwo Meetings‚Äù

Meanwhile, the growing pressure to get the economy restarted is running into the reality that while the outbreak looks to be slowing there is still significant risk of new outbreaks, as Beijing is learning (see item #1 below).

Things look more optimistic today in China than they did a week ago, and not just because of the positive energy propaganda onslaught, but it is far from over.

Exiting trades: When you don‚Äôt have a lot of cash/buying power, *exiting* becomes so much more important so you can continue to *enter* trades. I still think SPCE is not yet done and will hit 40+ again, but had I closed between 41-42 today that would‚Äôve given me the capital to buy into ALLY (which I was all on board with ‚Äî just no cash). If I closed out all of my SPCE positions I would have had $9000+ to play with and whatever I bet on ALLY would have netted about 150+% returns today.

Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it ""completes,"" the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another ""lower high"" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies."
