They emailed me today and stated they can't give me a cash refund because they're only reimbursing for flights booked from March(!?) onwards.  They offered me a voucher.  The fucking audacity.  And of course demand is still gutted so there are 0 comparable flights available for the forseeable future.  It was originally a 6hr direct with upgrades and all im seeing now are 12hr+ multi stop economy flights.

At the same time the Fed said it will bar the 34 largest banks that participated in the test from share buybacks in Q3, while capping dividends to shareholders. The move is reportedly designed to ensure that the banks have sufficient loss absorbing capital to keep credit flowing during the pandemic. The Fed also called on all 34 big banks that participated in the stress tests to resubmit their capital plans, a move usually only required for banks that fail the test, as the economic situation is changing quickly and remains uncertain"

But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.

I asked about it to get some DD and they were hiring for over 4 different positions. 

The 10 biggest states are re opening heavily as well. Even California has restaurant dining rooms re opened. AZ, FL, and TX are almost back to normal and they‚Äôre massive commercial hubs. They will NOT shut back down. Worst worst case scenario is mandatory mask wearing but I don‚Äôt even see that happening.

On top of that, if someone on the team got sick, we'd have to close up for a couple of weeks.

I'm looking around for the best tool to kill this motherfucker. Realizing im short on time, I've got a new pair of very high quality, flexible, yet hard bottom insoles that i recently took out of the packaging. Creep up to this mother fucker and SLAM the shit out of him, guts over the dresser. But his body flings against the wall and seems to fall under my bed. I'm like fuck, this dude must be dead. But I ain't taking no risks. I take out my phone, go mission impossible with the phone cuz the crease between my bed and wall is so slim, I gotta just squeeze it through.

Protect the old and sick and everyone else let's do this. A vaccine isn't coming  the only hope is a treatment. And we now know the effects unlike in February and have methods to help get people through it.  My wife had it for 7 weeks. After 5 gave her a steroid and a inhaler and it gave her the edge to beat it. She's 44 and has poor circulation hence a healthy person with a minor condition she felt better and then next day bam new symptom cough chest fever i get that the virus is no joke but my main point is throughout history medical professionals have all agreed that the only way to beat these things are to push through it. Yes losinf your loved ones sucks. But everyday is a crap shoot anyway. 600k yr cancer 200k violent crimes shootings stabbing beatings ect. But life goes on. Its way out of whack    they report new cases but not total test on msm. Look at the amount of testing being done its 2x now. Logic says 2x samples= +-2x positive test.  And wheres the death spike??  I mean these #s been climbing for 2 weeks. This weekend should see em dropping like flies.  Plus whats being counted just swabs or are antibody test being counted cause that would be a new case but also a recovered case. See we are being fed shit and kept in the dark.

Except, as with all things boomer, their peanut brains nowhere near cover for their rapacious greed. Now theyre stuck with assets nobody wants to buy (at their delusional valuations) and the Fed has prematurely pumped stocks and left boomers priced out. No cruises for you, gramps

Boomers being greedy and dumb, they'll vote themselves a real estate bailout at the cost of dismantling the state except for the military and buy in at the top of the stock market anyway, which will be the signal for Wall Street whales to sell everything and unleash the giga dump. One silver lining is boomers will live to see the last shreds of their wealth evaporate in a dumpocaust of daily -10% candles which will make the March massacre look like babytown frolics"

Every night he‚Äôd pray to papa Elon to make his small account grow. 

And grow it did. That $900 account grew and grew and within 3 weeks, he had $280,000. Roughly enough to buy 7 Model 3s. 

But this boy was a greedy little piggy and decided $280k was not enough. He now wanted 1 million dollars. So he traded and traded until his account got slapped in the face with a brick called Ron√£. He was back where he started and is slowly clawing his way back up.

Then i remembered. *I remembered how many of you have gone to hell and back. ""Scared money don't make money""* My heart raced and i looked around for some degenerate plays that no sane man would make.

- Exchanges stop taking notices of exercise from brokers 1.5 hours after close. You can exercise/be assigned until 5:30pm EST. Yes, most PM earnings calls fall into this time period.

- Not all brokers will allow you to exercise 1.5 hours after close. However you can always be assigned for 1.5 hours after close, this includes holders who want to exercise on AH movement.

Funny that it happened right around when warrants expire, tomorrow at 5pm.


See this ‚û°Ô∏è https://i.imgur.com/K1BTGor.png

It's common.


With their warrants expiring tomorrow, you can saythe beach ball will finally pop up out of water and the stock will rise. 

Today was one of the best buying opportunities you would have gotten on the stock, but it's pullback still maintains awesome value.

Here's the big boys trick. They short the stock into warrant expiration to get the best buy price.

See this snippet‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://imgur.com/a/fHdQG8e


Analysts fool retail by publicating buy ratings and increased price targets near the expiration.

The other day was a $55 buy upgrade, last week was a $50 one and tonight was a $60 buy upgrade.

They are shorting the stock up until tomorrow only to buy cheap and enjoy the ride.

The bank says data from trials of BNT-122, which uses mRNA technology and was developed by BioNTech and partner Roche Holding, showed what HSBC described as 'clearly disappointing' patient responses. HSBC says the results suggest mRNA-based vaccines may not be as immunogenic as hoped. BioNTech and partner Pfizer, as well as Moderna Inc., are developing Covid-19 vaccines based on mRNA approaches. ""The failure of BNT-122 should provide pause for thought on the prospects for mRNA approaches in vaccination for COVID-19 and other diseases,"" HSBC analyst Steve McGarry says

So I decided to hit him up recently about options trading because I figured he‚Äôd be interested and he was. I told him to research how options work first and I sent him some resources to read.

The Florida spike caused Apple to close 14 stores in the state, following its decision to close stores in Houston yesterday. In worsening retail news, Macy's said it plans to cut about 3,900 jobs.

California saw its second-largest daily jump, raising further concern of a resurgence. New Jersey counted almost 2,000 more deaths with a ""probable"" link to Covid-19. Meanwhile, President Trump has largely ignored the most recent spike in cases.

Brazil, which ranks second globally in total cases and deaths, launched a plan to test more than 20% of its 210 million people. And Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera has tested positive with mild symptoms.

Stocks climbed the most in more than a week as investors weighed the prospects for additional stimulus against the surge in American virus cases. Banks advanced after regulators weakened the Volcker Rule. Speaking of stimulus‚Äîthe IRS issued $1.4 billion to people who were dead.

The United States Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it restricted dividends banks can pay shareholders and required them to suspend share repurchases in the third quarter after its annual stress test showed some banks could approach minimum capital levels amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed added banks can only pay dividends in line with a formula based on recent income and that they need to re-evaluate their long-term capital plans.

Besides the annual stress test, the Fed conducted an additional sensitivity test due to the pandemic and concluded banks will have to resubmit their capital plans this year. The central bank also noted that in three scenarios maximum unemployment in the US was between 15.6% and 19.5%.

Additional analysis will be performed in each quarter during the coronavirus crisis to reassess the situation in the banking sector."

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will miss the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. 

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a comment on WSB asking whether stress test of banks has been priced in or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

TLDR: SalesForce üöÄ. Slack is a üåàüêª

SalesForce is number one CRM and if your company don't use SalesForce that mean you are gay and poor. SalesForce previously said they going to integrate with Slack but now its going to have its own Slack. SalesForce know it control its customer's data and those bitchies ain't going anywhere once SalesForce come out with a Slack style hook.

what does this mean for Slack? Everyone and their mama that can code can basically come out with a Slack clone. Microsoft know this and now SalesForce. 

Slack have no moat! Fucking Zoom with an army of Chinese coders can build a better shit than Slack and we all saw ZOOM MOON üåô"

I understand the stress test was designed before COVID. I understand they have some COVID ad hoc adjustments they can make to these various scenarios. 

The repeal of the Volkmer rule I‚Äôm guessing made it easier, also ad hoc, to pass the test. 

So to my mind this seems like something they could have cooked the shit out of. It‚Äôs not like the blowback from the jobs report effected anything.

2020-06-25 20:34:07,Its_the_dankness,12," The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event.

""The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,"" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, ""and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.""

In addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession.

In the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets.

In aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance.

In light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans.

All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.

During the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income.

The Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests."

2020-06-25 20:32:52,-AUTISTICUS_MAXIMUS-,13," 

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event.

""The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,"" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, ""and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.""

In addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession.

In the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets.

In aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance.

In light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans.

All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.

During the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income.

The Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests."

The extra 600 a week from unemployment runs out in 5 weeks so they probably won't get to take advantage of that.
