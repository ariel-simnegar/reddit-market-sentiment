2019-10-31 21:08:03,DeMayon,20,"I've got the TA on GDXJ (Junior gold miners) but the same logic can be applied to /GC futures and GLD as a whole because they trade together.

Lets get into it:

Recently, we received the FOMC news that the FED cut rates three times in a row. The dollar, soon after, tanked and gold has a fresh breath of air. It has a reason to rally - global banks all over the world are cutting rates in lieu of facing a recession. They want to do QE? That's fine with me, gold will continue to breakout as long as the government deflates the dollar and safe havens like precious metals and bonds keep getting bought up.

So, from a macro perspective, gold has plenty of reasons to run. It has hit all-time-highs in EVERY major currency except for the USD.

As debt increases, gold becomes substantially more attractive. https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Debt.png
The global flat currencies will keep declining...gold will keep rising.

Gold is being bought up by central bankers, more so than any other entity.
