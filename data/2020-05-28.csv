>  
>Mnuchin put out a notice earlier today that he was planning on visiting “random people’s islands” so he could “leave a stimulus package or note on their bulletin board”. He opened his DMs for four minutes, giving followers a chance to leave some Dodo codes so he could come visit, before heading off on an evening of being offered fruit, interrupting people’s islands with cutscenes and hopefully some wholesome online transactions.

These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you! -Trump (Twitter)"

A former club owner in south Minneapolis says the now-fired police officer and the black man who died in his custody this week both worked security for her club up to the end of last year.

George Floyd and now-former Officer Derek Chauvin both worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo club on Lake Street, according to Maya Santamaria. Santamaria owned the building for nearly two decades, but sold the venue within the last few months. 

""Chauvin was our off-duty police for almost the entirety of the 17 years that we were open,"" Santamaria said. ""They were working together at the same time, it's just that Chauvin worked outside and the security guards were inside.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-minneapolis-death.html

Jovanni Thunstrom, the owner of Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis, said he employed Mr. Floyd as a bouncer at the restaurant, and was also his landlord.

“No one had nothing bad to say about him,” Mr. Thunstrom said. “They all are shocked he’s dead. He never caused a fight or was rude to people.”

Mr. Thunstrom said Mr. Floyd paid his rent last week and told him that he was looking for a new job because Conga Latin Bistro has been closed to on-site dining since March because of the coronavirus. “I lost a friend,” Mr. Thunstrom said.



https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/28/us/ap-us-minneapolis-police-death-officers.html

Minneapolis City Council records show that Chauvin moonlighted as a bouncer at a downtown Latin nightclub. He was among a group of six officers who opened fire on a stabbing suspect in 2006 after a chase that ended when the suspect pointed a sawed-off shotgun at them. The suspect, Wayne Reyes, was hit multiple times and died. A grand jury decided the use of force was justified."

Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
 If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irri- tate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arro- gant.
If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.”

“You’re in luck!” the taxi driver says. “I just came from there. There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.

As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.

You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.

“Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.

You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.

The market is a battle, and bulls are like the frontline infantry. They just run and mindlessly buy calls, and they will almost always print, because there is strength in numbers. Everyone is running in and shooting and swinging, so eventually, you win, sorta. In the military, this is known as ""stonks only go up.""


Bears are like snipers. You gotta wait patiently. If you shoot a second too early, or too late, you're gonna get straight fucked. But if you time it just right, you snipe that big drop and get rewarded bigly, as the downward trend and IV multiplication takes your premiums to heights that the bull infantry could only dream of.

This is why bears get all the hot chicks, because snipers have big pps."

There are 261 working days in a year. 100,000 / 261 ≈ $383.00. So let’s round up to $400.00 per day for tax purposes (I know this will be off). You only need to make $400.00 per day scalping to reach $100,000 in a full working year!!! (I know taxes will vary that #, but it’s not far off at all from that).

Morning: Open deep red, rebound EOD.   


Midday: Open flat-to-down, drop on news, flatten out towards EOD.   


After close: Open flat-to-down, rangebound 0.5% most of the day until a fearful EOD selloff. Monday blood red with weekend rhetoric from both sides.   


Does he pull off the band aid in the AM to salvage Friday even if Monday is screwed? Does he speak midday and keep the market relatively balanced and buy some time to get brrrr involved?   


Or...does he decide he doesn't want a Friday crash and hopes the weekend counters the news for a flat-to-upbeat Monday?   


My guess, 5pm EST Friday, and what some (the Guardian) believe we're going to see are Chinese students expelled and sanctions against Chinese officials.

Why do you downvote? Are you really that sad of a person that you have little fits of spite and have to reach out through a medium that has nothing to do with validity? You do realize karma is worthless right? And that downvoting a comment doesn't do anything to the legitimacy of what's in the post right? Or do you just ignore all of that because you're butthut and have to lash out like a baby in need of a circumcision? I mean seriously! You can't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button? Do you feel like you've had vengeance on me or something? I personally don't care about downvotes either way (by all means, call your silly downvote brigade on me, it means nothing at all to me), but I just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points. Reddit really is all you have, huh? Damn do I feel bad for you. But you know what? I don’t care! I’ll rake in the coal! You’re logic is flawed, kiddo. Don't like what people are doing with it? Downvote me, that'll show 'em! Go ahead and press that down arrow, I know you're itching to do it. Think you're contributing to the community? ""Doing your civic duty""? Nope. You're just decreasing a meaningless number on the internet. You just want to hop on the bandwagon. Well POUNCE! O can hear you as your feet land on the cold real steel of the inside of the wagon. You know what? Enjoy the ride, for now. Maybe even stick your head out the window and feel the breeze while you reflect on the importance of your downvote to me. I'll even give you my word, this isn't even my primary account, kiddo. Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that we allow free speech and the truth to be shared. I don’t care about the karma. Hell, I’ll gladly rake in the coal! But we must remember that free speech and opinions are key to our society and, more importantly, reddit. So, next time you want to downvote something, just think about what you are about to do!"

The biggest hinderance to the markets currently is not the virus. It’s the tension between the US and China. Trump will escalate, let the market recover, offer good news to send us higher. Then repeat.

Think of it like this:

Spy @ 300 but you want ATH?

1) send Spy -> 295 on bad news that you control

2) let markets rally to ~298 on bs like they always do

3) offer good news to markets, sending Spy -> 303

The thing is, he's desperate to win and he's willing to pull out all the stops to do so. He's got a lot of skin riding on this election between the deutschebank crap and the withholding of information from the russia report, he could really be f'ed if he loses and this stuff is released.

>MINNEAPOLIS—Calling for a more measured way to express opposition to police brutality, critics slammed demonstrators Thursday for recklessly looting businesses without forming a private equity firm first. “Look, we all have the right to protest, but that doesn’t mean you can just rush in and destroy any business without gathering a group of clandestine investors to purchase it at a severely reduced price and slowly bleed it to death,” said Facebook commenter Amy Mulrain, echoing the sentiments of detractors nationwide who blasted the demonstrators for not hiring a consultant group to take stock of a struggling company’s assets before plundering. “I understand that people are angry, but they shouldn’t just endanger businesses without even a thought to enriching themselves through leveraged buyouts and across-the-board terminations. It’s disgusting to put workers at risk by looting. You do it by chipping away at their health benefits and eventually laying them off. There’s a right way and wrong way to do this.” At press time, critics recommended that protestors hold law enforcement accountable by simply purchasing the Minneapolis police department from taxpayers."

June 15: most indoor retail sales, outdoor restaurant dining, non-emergency medical appointments and professional sporting events — without fans in the seats — will be allowed to resume.


July 13: modified indoor dining would be allowed, along with some personal services like barbershops and hair salons.

mid-August: schools, bars, gyms, nail and hair salons, and tattoo parlors, likely with some modifications to promote safety, could open.

The last phase, with no set date, would bring back some of the largest public gatherings, like concerts, sporting events with fans, nightclubs, festivals, and all hotels and lodging for leisure and tourism."

Bought a ton of 6/1 and 5/29 SPY puts about an hour after open and continued to periodically buy throughout the day. Ended up with 1800 by the time midday came around. Was down -$124,000 at one point today (that was like, -50% of entire account), felt pretty bad. EOD drop brought it all the way back to +$116,313. I hate myself rn tbh even though it worked out."
