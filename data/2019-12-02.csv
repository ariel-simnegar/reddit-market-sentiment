I had a feeling this might happen. Trump creates a win-win by doing this. If he wins the election, China loses the ""wait him out"" option and is forced to make a deal. If he loses, the next Prez will be stuck with this problem & Trump can just say ""Well, I did most of the work"" if there's a deal, or ""See, I'm the only one who could have gotten that done"" if there's no deal."

2019-12-03 09:24:17,Seedeh,2,"Alright fuckers, here's my take:

$AMRN is shit and only has value because it was the first. $MTNB and $ACST are the real competitors. Both are shithole penny stocks and I believe they have the right to beat $AMRN. They're both better drugs, and they both are earlier in their stages so they're cheap now. Both companies have seemingly good financials.

But fuck $ACST.

CaPre ($ACST) isn't as good as MAT9001 (god awful name $MTNB) and there's some shit about having to lose weight to do the drug. This is medication for people having heart attacks. Good luck losing weight with that one buddy.

Anywho, tendies if you invest in either but I think $MTNBIKE is the best. Plus, it's up and the other is down today.

TL;DR: All in $TSLA puts.

Also fuck you if you don't say biopharma is risky. Of course it is. I'm not responsible for your shithole loss of cash, but if you want tendies, well, there ya go."
