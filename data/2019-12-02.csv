I had a feeling this might happen. Trump creates a win-win by doing this. If he wins the election, China loses the ""wait him out"" option and is forced to make a deal. If he loses, the next Prez will be stuck with this problem & Trump can just say ""Well, I did most of the work"" if there's a deal, or ""See, I'm the only one who could have gotten that done"" if there's no deal."

$AMRN is shit and only has value because it was the first. $MTNB and $ACST are the real competitors. Both are shithole penny stocks and I believe they have the right to beat $AMRN. They're both better drugs, and they both are earlier in their stages so they're cheap now. Both companies have seemingly good financials.

But fuck $ACST.

CaPre ($ACST) isn't as good as MAT9001 (god awful name $MTNB) and there's some shit about having to lose weight to do the drug. This is medication for people having heart attacks. Good luck losing weight with that one buddy.

Anywho, tendies if you invest in either but I think $MTNBIKE is the best. Plus, it's up and the other is down today.

TL;DR: All in $TSLA puts.

Also fuck you if you don't say biopharma is risky. Of course it is. I'm not responsible for your shithole loss of cash, but if you want tendies, well, there ya go."

**Autocallable Contingent Coupon Equity Linked Securities Linked to Square, Inc. Due** **December 17, 2020**

   
The securities offered by this pricing supplement are unsecured debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and guaranteed by Citigroup Inc. The securities offer the potential for periodic contingent coupon payments at an annualized rate that, if all are paid, would produce a yield that is generally higher than the yield on our conventional debt securities of the same maturity. In exchange for this higher potential yield, you must be willing to accept the risks that

 1. your actual yield may be lower than the yield on our conventional debt securities of the same maturity because you may not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments, 

2. **the value of what you receive at maturity may be significantly less than the stated principal amount of your securities, and may be zero,** and 

3. **the securities may be automatically called for redemption prior to maturity** beginning on the first potential autocall date specified below. 

&#x200B;

Each of these risks will depend on the performance of the underlying specified below. **Although you will have downside exposure to the underlying, you will not receive dividends** with respect to the underlying **or participate in any appreciation of the underlying.**▪

Investors in the securities must be willing to accept

 1. an investment that may have limited or no liquidity and

 2. the risk of not receiving any payments due under the securities if we and Citigroup Inc. default on our obligations. **All payments on the securities are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc.**

I think the dude has a wicked vision that the world is ought to get America.   He is 71 years old and needs to fukkin retire.   His vision is driven by his childhood as he saw his blue collar town jobs disapper.  Back in 80's he fuckked Japan economy and caused 2 recessions with trade war.   He used to snap his speakers from his ear,  curse at everyone during meetings and walk out.   I think right now trying to use same approach against China which backfired.   China called it quit back 4-5 months and said they want to be treated with respect.   Dude is freakin brutal negotiator.

China is world power and too hard to stop.   These people refuse to believe we live in a world economy.   Tech has changed fabrics of society.   These boomers need to retire.  Protectionism is dead."

The only problem is that taking Adderall makes Joe very serious and introspective so that he becomes socially awkward and can't really connect with people around him, but whenever he's not on addy he becomes unmotivated and complacent and begins to resent himself for this. What advice might you have for Joe?"

If I sell I get taxed 25% meaning a permanent 25% drawdown. Instead I would like to create a synthetic short on NVDA so that the downward move in NVDA I’m expecting gets captured by the options and I end up paying a smaller tax on the gains in the options when I liquidate. With the profits from the synthetic short I would buy more NVDA stock with, thereby getting me to almost as though I had sold NVDA stock for the time I was expecting a downward move.

As I posted [intraday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4xkju/daily_discussion_thread_december_02_2019/f9h1oxs/) today we had a shift downward but it wasn't anything overly concerning. What became concerning was the manner of price action that followed into EOD, where I said I was now [loading up on some puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4xkju/daily_discussion_thread_december_02_2019/f9hjp97/) because of weak buying action and continued selling momentum. The difference between today and Nov 20, where we had a similar pullback and a period of trading below a technical support, is that a) the selling volume is drastically higher b) large divergences in RSI and PPO that matched those we had seen in the October pullback c) VIX has reached a low not seen since around April. 

We also have a potential bear flag forming that many of you have picked up on. We'll have to wait until tomorrow to see whether it resolves in that manner. However, there was enough suggestion for me today in the crayons to say that today was a good place to hedge shorts and watch how they play out for the rest of the week.

As I've said in previous crayon posts, 307ish (307.3 if we're splitting hairs) is the target drop for anticipated completion of a correction, so that would be the point you would want to re-evaluate your puts or pile into calls, whichever jacket you're wearing. That's not a massive pullback on a % basis, but because of the bullishness of the market, watch for potential overshoots or undershoots based around that number. And obviously, if there is yuge news that rattle the markets that will also change my analysis, but for now I do think we'll see a continued sell-off throughout the week, with the minimum being a re-test of 309.5.

Good luck you animals and wash your hands before you touch the tendies."

Algos drive the price action of futures based on whatevers open.
Right now, it's the Nikkei.
The Nikkei opened mega red. like -1.3% or something.
The Nikkei is now recoveriing. It is pumping hard to -0.85%.

Then algos mimic the price action of the Nikkei, pumping it up.
It really doesn't have much to do with US indexes, except that the algos will react to any news.


So, the next index that will open is Hang Seng (HSI). HSI futures closed somewhat down during
US trading hours. If the HSI follows the Nikkei, then expect blood green futures. Otherwise,
maybe expect a selloff in futures when HSI crashes and burns.

also fun fact, the Japanese government owns like 80% of the ETFs traded in Japan and whatever QE they're doing is insane. Trump would love to replace the fed with the BoJ."

Going to start stepping into mid Jan and Feb AMD calls. If you want long dated calls or shares of AMD now or any time before CES would be a fine time to build up. It is not going to double again this year, but i could see anywhere from 50 to 60s by next Jan depending on how their mobile and next EYPC chip stack up. I think the big wildcard is the mobile. They will have the console revenue this year as well. An EPS of 1.5 isn't unreasonable for full year 2020  and a 40 multiple gets you $60 a share, 30 multiple gets you 45. That being said who knows how the market will react of we have a major correction. 


TSM earnings are Jan 16. I like long calls or shares on TSM for the next year or 2 till Intel or Samsung figure their shit out. They have 5nm on the way and have industry leaders from every field as customers. They are booked to capacity and are spending billions to produce more and on R n D to stay ahead.

2019-12-02 21:21:19,27onfire,-8,I need a bit of gay love.  I sold my 6Dec TTD puts today when the stock was hovering at about 231 per share.  At close TTD was at 227.39.  This would have been another 3200 to me.  This is stinging especially since I am not a high roller.  I sold at what I thought to be the bottom for the day and made off with a bit over 20k. I was happy with this result especially because the stock moved to 233 and change for a bit after I sold and I am almost certain had I not sold at the 231 level I would have been screaming fuck and sold at 232 233.  Now I am questioning my outlook on the puts to begin with should I have held till expiration instead of locking in my gain... It took massive will to hold through last week as I lost more than 50 percent of my position but I had what I thought was a solid trade so I held through.  I just don't want to feel bad if it moves to 223 or below 220 tomorrow.  I know I shouldn't but I just need some thoughts.  Overall I think I am happy and I made the right decision considering my holding through hell last week but I just do not want to slam my head against the wall tomorrow afternoon and try to make those gains somewhere else in a haphazard fashion.
