Highlighting this quote because that's what bears will be pretending not to see today while they lose their ass. Basically Trump admitted that his comments didn't reflect the situation with the talks, he just wanted to be a ""tough guy"". Bears who'll get fucked today are asking for it, godspeed.

Here's the current situation, from BBG story:

> U.S. negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on Dec. 15, the people said. Outstanding issues in the talks include how to guarantee China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and exactly which tariffs to roll back, they added. 

And yeah before you say anything, of course it's all bollocks, but market ain't about what's real and what's not, it's about what has changed versus day before. And what has changed is the stories that took us down are no longer valid, so we should reprice back up."
