(Not that orderly bullshit we got yesterday..supposedly the 3rd worst day in stock market history..didn’t feel that way in my opinion) you dump it 15% here and shake EVERYONE out. “Recession” will hit -47% and bounce from there. While the stock market goes side ways while the economy regains its footing once the virus passes over. Probably have a few negative quarters of GDP. And then boom back to ATH

2020-03-17 09:42:50,vn4dw,6,The market is crashing because there are more cases than indicated by these websites. These virus-tracking websites that are available to the general public have delayed data and don't update until the end of the day or every 6-12 hours. Hedge funds have access to much more accurate data that is updated every few minutes or hour. SO presumably there was a surge in cases over the past few hours that puts the projected total today at around 15-20k at least.

Huuuge dip yesterday makes me *feel* like we’re due for a pump, plus there’s been a lot of new info and studies coming out on hydroxychloroquine being EXTREMELY effective on in vitro tests (90% cure rate after 6 days vs 96% of control still having corona without the drug). The guy who was a co-author on the paper talked a bit about it on tv last night and said he plans on making an announcement this week for a massive global trial similar to that dude who cured polio. 

In short, I think we’ll have a big pump sometime this week when the co-author of that study makes an announcement and the media hypes it up like we’re all gonna be saved. SPY $300 3/20

Edit: 
I’d like to add that I got this info from Papa Muskrat’s Twitter talking about it and the researcher responded. I have complete faith our lord and savior will deliver me the tendies"

3/20 - 260 Put - 18.5K @ $18.19  
3/20 - 230 Call - 18.5K @ $23.56

1.) If the underlying increases over $260, the put is worthless and OTM, whereas the call is ITM.

2.) If the underlying is between $230 and $260, both will be in the money.

3.) If the underlying is below $230, the call is worthless and OTM, whereas the put is ITM.

It seems like 1 and 3 wouldn't work because the worthless call or put would wash out any gains for the ITM option. This is assuming that the ITM option gain won't far exceed the OTM option loss. Will it?

They would be golden if it were 2. Though, wouldn't the premium affect them? Would they even exercise the option?"

It’s gonna hurt. But I know not to panic, and I will try to be calm. Just like how daddy taught me.

When and if a circuit breaker hits, I will access a new secondary straddle point. Up or down. Typically up.

NBA doesn't think they'll restart until mid June, which means Finals may be in late July at best (if we assume they just go directly to playoffs and have like 5 game series for first round). Big problem since Olympics is late July....

Also basketball has an Olympic Qualifying Tournament since some teams (like Giannis and Greece and others like Serbia and Canada and Luka's Slovenia) are not in the Olympics but can still qualify. There's no way they can run that tournament. 

So it's almost like unless Olympics wants to sacrifice basketball which is literally one of the main attractions, they have to postpone....

I'm almost positive they'll postpone it until August at best. But as long as it runs it's still good for Nike. If it doesn't Nike gonna take more hits."

Edit just FYI for people downvoting, there was a legit chance this even happened today (see my post below). They just won't tell the public since it's only a market maker locate short ban on a few ETFs. I know this happens from time to time since I've seen it happen. It also only affects market makers so it's not like some massive market event. Basically when you short you have to locate shares and they can prevent you from getting the locate. So you as a market maker have to borrow the shares internally (from another desk) or just not be able to short these ETFs. If you can't short the ETFs you have to do other things like buy VIX futures or short individual equities to hedge."

Very near term: puts on apparel companies that rely heavily on foot traffic. They will be bleeding out the hardest: LULU, LB, GPS, KSS, TJX, JWN, ROST. I'm not sure about ROST (Ross) since that's where the newly poor will shop. GPS (Gap) and JWM (Nordstrom) might get an online game up in running in time to not die.

Malls failing really puts SPG (Simon Property Group) in a bad place. Might want to just get puts on that right now to be quite honest.

Mid term: Then there are the other real estate holdings that I know very little about. [With many US cities banning evictions during this time](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-cities-are-temporarily-banning-evictions-as-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-2020-03-14?mod=home-page) Their revenue streams may get completely fucked. I think the play here is to see which companies have the most exposure in the low-income housing market. Tickers I need to read up about: VTR, O, WELL, VNO, AIV, WY, PEAK, SLG, KIM, FRT

Long term: Lastly, with the coming foreclosures there should be ample housing supply so puts on homebuilders: PHM, DHI, NVR, LEN

Thoughts?"

Brusaferro stated that two patients under the age of 40 had died. Both were aged 39.
One had a tumour and died in hospital, while the other died at home and “had some comorbid factors including diabetes, obesity and other types of ailments that characterized his life before becoming infected,” said Brusaferro.

#Almost all patients were already suffering from serious health problems, including cancer, when the coronavirus infection was detected, according to the new data from the ISS."

This weekend in Chicago I saw the biggest cesspool of young 20 something year olds at bars and parties for saint Patrick’s day partying drunk af all day. Some of them even had the balls to go to brunch the day after and continue partying after floating around in a sea of disease. That’s a compounding effect. No one took it seriously UNTIL TODAY. Now everyone is finally staying home. But the damage is done. 

This weekend will be the reckoning in Chicago (and New York, Paris and any other city center that didn’t take it seriously the past weekend). We are so unprepared here. Try googling “where to get corona virus test”. THERE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER OR LOCATOR (at least for Chicago)You have to dig for an answer. So what do you do? Go to a hospital. They will be flooded this weekend. Pray for your medical professional friends.

I just logged into ETrade and my position reflects the current after hours quote, which is above $241, knocking my options OTM. Weren’t my contracts supposed to expire at market close, today? Do I actually have to close the positions?

The position is now marked at a 75% loss. The options weren’t ITM until seconds before market close.

Clearly I’m a beginner, so take it easy on me.

Some help and guidance here would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit: I only bought 2 contracts luckily. Lesson learned. I had more than enough buying power to exercise, just didn’t get a chance to login to ETrade between when the options went ITM and market close."

&#x200B;

Here's where the TIFU comes in... I was planning to burn a day trade and sell my puts and roll into calls during Trump's presser. I ended up getting pulled into an emergency pandemic planning meeting where I wasn't going to be able to do any trading. I picked up a SPY 3/25 $280c for dirt cheap during a dip so I could somewhat hedge against any pump that Trump would provide. Pump never came, but somehow my call is up $0.10? Idk, this market is fucking nuts right now...

&#x200B;

Anyways, how fucked am I going to be with the futures doing what they're doing? Hopefully my $280c is going to hedge me plenty against the pounding I'm going to take on my $200p and my $195p. I am still super bearish overall, but I feel like I'm going to be missing out on some super sweet tendies."

2020-03-17 01:47:41,SirGrapes,6,"If you look at the DOW 1M chart, every dip has been followed by a considerable pump. 

Understand that many of these sharp rises had heavy backing through the fed pumps and policy changes. 

If you’re buying puts or calls one week out or same day expiration, you’re banking off news and what the government thinks of next, or what 🅱️onnie 🅱️ump says in his PC’s. You might as well roll roulette, and granted, that’s why a lot of people are here.

But undeniably, the chart is moving down, much faster in its downward spikes than up, and the pumps have every big wig panicking and doing whatever they can to keep themselves from going under.

Options run out when the economy is literally halted, what, are we going to have negative interest rates next? We have a ways to go down before we see a considerable bounce or at least bottom out, and that comes with good news about the virus IN THE STATES. I think we all know that the worst is yet to come, though it’s hard to say what or when the worst will be.


TL;DR: DOW will rise back to 21,500~ tomorrow and Wednesday with shallow dips, before a steep drop to sub 20,000 late this week or next week. Puts 4-6 weeks out, or 3/20-3/27 if you feelin risky.

Even if corona virus is priced in to some degree, shit is just starting to hit the fan in the US. Tons of people are taking advantage of cheap admissions or less crowded places (pics of Disney World parade last night was nauseating)"

I also plan to nibble on some blue chip stocks that are on deep discount so I can built up my stock portfolio. Any suggestions of nice ones to get let me know.
2020-03-17 01:28:03,Petroselinum_,6,"Look, TA isn’t the holy grail, but it may not be totally useless either.

Anyway, we hit the 200-week moving average today. Good time to get a sucker’s rally going.

Also what the hell are futures doing? We’re not even up 4% (according to ToS), yet it looks like we’ve hit the +5% limit up? There are also ~5k contracts bid at 2498."

These last weeks though, watching SPY is truly like a scoreboard of our hopes for the fate of the entire world. What levels of devastation will the virus bring upon everyone?

I’m a 🌈🐻, which brings me no joy. It’s sad that the fate of humanity has a real chance of grim prospects. People talking about puts at $85 that have a real price means there’s genuine belief that could happen.

I have a Finance degree not worth shit and MBA worth a dried up white dog turd. Been trading for more than 15 years. Back in college '08, I got lucky and predicted the bottom of March '09. I loaded up ETF FAS, 3X financials. Remember the banks were strongly oversold because of the bailout. 

This is not like the great recession, but the volatility is insane to me. Options are starting to get soooo expensive, be cautious too far out of the money. I don't think we are out at the bottom though. There will be some strong lagging effects of these shutdowns and the longer it goes on, the more impact it will leave. We are in a rare timing where Q1 and Q2 earnings for quite a bit of companies will be effected. We know what industries will have the biggest impacts but think about the trickle effect. Unemployment rates will see and increase due to the shutdowns. Productivity will be lower due to school shutdowns. The list goes on.

The safest bet now is sit back and watch for now. When the volatility slows down, throw a chunk of change in a overall ETF:. TQQQ, SPY, UDOW. The market is defiently oversold due to fear in panic, but the fear is still on high alert until this shit blows over. 

Hope this is helpful to some autistic out there! Fuck bitches make money."

This week is going to be a good news week, legislation passed, bailouts determined, cases climbing but looks manageable, lock downs in effect, sentiment is going to be high. Spy will hit 255 perhaps 265.  In 2-3 weeks, by April 1st, all that's going to change.  Because of the lock down, everyone who is asymptomatic will spread it to their entire family and they will all get sick at once.  Every state will be in full on emergency mode trying to deal with the millions of people flooding the hospitals. The medical system will be infected at 15-20% rates.  People will go into a panic.  The death toll will rise very quickly. This is when the stock market will go sub 240 to the bottom, perhaps over the course of April and June. Business won't be able to sustain months of 0 revenue, massive bankruptcies and layoffs.

2020-03-17 00:07:51,Better_with_toast,29,"Just have to point out, that Vix peaks rarely coincide with market bottoms. 

See 2008, and dotcom. 

I'm a seller of premium right now. Good way to get long. Calendar spreads and  selling puts (that takes too much capital, however, so I get it).

Spiders are at risk. Apple, are you kidding me? We are at October levels when you were already overbought as a motherfucker? More pain to come for big tech. 

I like Boeing (Yes, BBB credit drop, but jesus fuck guys, Assets and Cash are well over the currently traded market cap. Long term). JPM, 3M, DOW, PHILLIP FUCKING MORRIS. Get long. Buy June or Sept calls, sell weeklies at the same strike to recoup 60% or more of your premium off rip. Sell more calls afterwards to limit downside.

I'm long SPXL, get in and get out. The liquidity is horseshit, so sell it when you have the chance, but they are at risk as mentioned before for getting dragged down.

Oil? Who said shit about oil? Bitch you cookin? Gtfo, I want nothing to do with it, neither should you.

Amazon? I LOVE me some Amazon, but I am NOT fucking buying it. These mother fuckers are SLAMMING my buddy postal worker in North Carolina. They are working triples guys. However, Amazon holdings are such a huge source of liquidity for so many people, I cant do it. If this market is going to reprice Tech to rational multiples, I cannot afford to buy long term Amazon calls and sell this premium. It'll be the only play I make, and I'm not willing to do that.

Theres my advice, retards. Let's make our smal PP accounts into ""she doesnt have to ask if it's in yet"" PP accounts. 

Cheers mother fuckers"

My available funds have doubled since last week, and I am almost to the point where I can play in the big kids pool (SPY, other more expensive options). What do you all think about SPYG and SPYV? They both tend to mirror SPY, but with a lower cost per share (and a lower cost of options). Obviously I won't get the crazy gains y'all get from SPY, but only working with ~$530 right now (started with $220).

Otherwise I will dig in some research tonight, and see how the market is acting in the AM. Might try and time buying during an upswing and see where it takes me.

Hundreds of colleges across the country have been getting closed down for the remainder of their semesters, or in many cases at least for a few weeks after spring break ends. Classes for these kids are all being moved online. Seriously, almost every college on the east coast has closed or extended its spring break by a minimum of two weeks with a possibility of indefinite closure. This to me is obviously going to cause a huge jump in the number of students that have online homework assignments and tests. Therefore, lazy kids cause Chegg subscribers to increase by the billions, making stonky line go up. Maybe time for some calls? Thoughts?"

2020-03-16 21:52:56,commentingrobot,2,"I bought AAL strangles today; with today's explosive move down, technically it's likely that tomorrow will bounce. AAL in particular is interesting because their cash position is worse than other airlines: Trump's announcement today that he'll support the airlines, if it results in any real action, makes it dramatically less likely that American will go bankrupt.

Will probably take profits and roll up the call leg tomorrow. But I'll be holding the short leg of the trade too, looking to close that on the next panicky red day, particularly if domestic air travel is shut down."

2020-03-16 21:50:43,zg44,34,"I think we're not all that far from the bottom despite most of today's move simply erasing Friday's EOD short squeeze.

We're pretty close to S&P 2350 which was the December 2018 low, though it's easy to argue we should be below that point given the economic problems that the coronavirus has exposed (way too many corporations gorged on cheap debt while throwing away cash on buybacks resulting in poor balance sheets, etc.).  Anywhere below S&P 2300 starts to present some really good long-term buying opportunities.

Bottoming is a process, and markets typically never bottom on days like today or last Thursday/Friday.

But a lot of crucial things happened in the past 24 hours: the Fed threw the whole recession fighting toolkit at the wall and Trump finally appears to have publicly acknowledged the real scope of the problem along with basically saying that we're in one of the worst case scenarios with this coronavirus slowdown/shutdown probably extending all the way to July/August.

Markets price in events based on expectations, and now we're getting to the point where the horror show that April/May will bring on the coronavirus front is really beginning to get priced into expectations.

So that's why I think it's starting to become likely that we find a bottom before April.  Of course, after that I'm skeptical of any sort of V-shaped recovery (we might get a mini-V 200+ point gain off a downside overshoot to S&P 2000-2100) but I expect a lot of choppiness and sidewards movement that will benefit theta/cash gang until late May."

(We’ve seen worse) it’s the magnitude and speed of them move. It’s frightening and our democracy and system are at risk.

I’m scared I’m going to over leverage myself out of my whole portfolio, so I need an outsiders perspective.

Positions:

**SPY**

*3/27 260p x1

*4/15 200p x3

*5/1 240p x2

*5/15 250p x2

*5/15 230p x3

**SPXL**

*4/17 30p x2

**CZR**

*4/17 9p x10

*6/19 10p x3

**LVS**

*4/17 40p x2

*5/15 35p x2

*6/19 35p x2

I’m up 35-40k on around 20k initial investment in 2 months. However total realized gains are still around break even.
