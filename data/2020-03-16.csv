Already -32% from ATH. -11% day yesterday..This is when you drop the floor out and dump it 15%. VIX  sitting at $82...TRUE Panic selling would occur. (Not that orderly bullshit we got yesterday..supposedly the 3rd worst day in stock market history..didn’t feel that way in my opinion) you dump it 15% here and shake EVERYONE out. “Recession” will hit -47% and bounce from there. While the stock market goes side ways while the economy regains its footing once the virus passes over. Probably have a few negative quarters of GDP. And then boom back to ATH
