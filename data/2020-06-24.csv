2020-06-26 00:08:56,Obliterated321,2,"Roller coaster day. Sat in bed for 4 hours watching my calls burn. Contemplating on if i should just exit the game altogether before a start taking all-time losses.

We're talking SIX, COTY, PFIZER, PBF, and NCLH calls. 

I end up selling about half of it by 1pm. And i think to myself, ""Is life worth living without stonks? What will i do at work? How will i cope with my mediocre life of being single forever? 

Then i remembered. *I remembered how many of you have gone to hell and back. ""Scared money don't make money""* My heart raced and i looked around for some degenerate plays that no sane man would make. Dumped 20% of my portfolio into a 6/26c on Tilray at about 2pm along with some PRPL puts and SEAS calls. 

By EOD my portfolio was up by 10% and i sold those damn gains. Now hoping to exit what i have tomorrow since my robinhood account is beyond fucked with all those day trades."
