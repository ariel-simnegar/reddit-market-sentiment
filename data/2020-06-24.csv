2020-06-26 00:08:56,Obliterated321,2,"Roller coaster day. Sat in bed for 4 hours watching my calls burn. Contemplating on if i should just exit the game altogether before a start taking all-time losses.

We're talking SIX, COTY, PFIZER, PBF, and NCLH calls. 

I end up selling about half of it by 1pm. And i think to myself, ""Is life worth living without stonks? What will i do at work? How will i cope with my mediocre life of being single forever? 

Then i remembered. *I remembered how many of you have gone to hell and back. ""Scared money don't make money""* My heart raced and i looked around for some degenerate plays that no sane man would make. Dumped 20% of my portfolio into a 6/26c on Tilray at about 2pm along with some PRPL puts and SEAS calls. 

By EOD my portfolio was up by 10% and i sold those damn gains. Now hoping to exit what i have tomorrow since my robinhood account is beyond fucked with all those day trades."

Global markets are in general trading in the range determined by past week and are currently in the lower end of the range

#____________________


Trade setup for today


#Spy is currently trying to find a support and such days are tricky to trade, we are looking to build long position at 305ish range with stop loss at 300 (not recommending this trade to y'all, doing this trade cause such trade tend to play out well usually)



315 comes out to be a surprising new resistance coming from this week's price action



Long term : Nasdaq not respecting it's 10k psychological support is a big red flag, we are planning to invest small quantity in quality stocks on this dip but are refraining to go big 



Today can be a surprising day and can be huge on ether side, this tends to happen on days when support is being determined, we are playing gamble by going long as the risk reward seems favorable with a bias that we might see a huge upmove intraday

Random tip for the day : ""if your derivative order gets placed almost immediately, you are most likely gonna lose on that trade""

2020-06-25 06:39:52,bobstaman,12,"Incoming potential wall of text.  
There's a much bigger picture here that I think a lot of people are missing. This whole situation started with Covid and the lockdowns but that's not the main reason we are in this economic downturn. We were literally right on queue to hit a recession right around where Covid hit. Now... what was also a reason?  
America has been in a Lost Decade since 2012. Our GDP growth has slowed down and compared to our debt, we are not growing. We were at the point that Japan was when everyone shoved their money in the market expecting 100% returns.  
""Bob you're crazy bro! Best economy ever!""...  
Everyone's talking about covid and IMF but what else are people talking about? TAXES! Yup. We are now, finally, coming to the realization that taxes NEED TO and WILL go up in the future if we ever want to get ourselves out of this economic hole. They speak of the left vs right and blue vs red but it's not about that. It's about everyone kicking the can down the road for decades and now we are FORCED to deal with it. IMF projecting a 2% GREATER contraction of Global GDP which is huge. Not only are we in a hole but the hole is now 5x as big.  
  
So when numbers start coming out showing that the consumer is spending less, making less, our GDP growth is less, our debt is higher, it should start making an impact.  
  
We got fucked because of Covid but we've been fucked because of our monetary policy for the past 40 years exacerbated by the necessity of QE since 08 till now, lack of debt service, and lack of GDP growth. Just... be ready. There's more to this whole thing than just Covid 19.  
  
...watch us be 5% green tomorrow lol."

2020-06-25 06:35:44,adatausb,2,"For those of you looking for an update on FLIR.

See original post here: [FLIR: The only COVID-19 play that hasn't been played out. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heln3e/flir_dd_the_only_covid19_play_that_hasnt_been/)


I bought more calls. 

At market open, FLIR skyrocketed and was actually up 2% at one point before selling off in the mass market crash the rest of the day. Very unfortunate that the momentum was killed, or I think it would have had a massive spike otherwise. It went vertical in the morning, literally like a meme stock. Unfortunate that the momentum was killed by broader market condition, but I'm still holding because the core ideas of my post are still valid. Resistance is still intact, and FLIR outperformed the market significantly throughout the day. Calls are actually up 40% today even in this mass market selloff. That means more people are willing to take a risk on it than SPY. 


I took this as an opportunity to add to my call position. I bought some higher strike July 45cs in addition to my 40c. Options are a teeny bit more expensive than yesterday, but that happens when market makers start to see potential in a stock. The same thing happened to Tesla, MRNA, and INO before they skyrocketed. Frankly, I think this might be the next big trend because there's no other solution to COVID in America anymore. We can't have another shutdown, and the people refuse to wear masks. Just to even make people feel safe, every business is going to want a thermal camera to show that they're ""Safe"". 

There was some great discussion in the previous thread. I suggest you read it."

Trump has to decide wether to be responsible for what will be 2x the COVID crisis, which he already bungled once. He will of course reject this because he is vindictive and hates ultimatums. The market crashes either way because spending dies on one end, and adding a second printer is overkill and armageddon (but gold will thrive). This hasn't been priced in (give it about a week before the stimulus and shut down become the theme of the media. When you hear that, another round of puts will print. Another stimulus package proposal if cases hit 2x the daily count is bearish. It's an admission that a vaccine is not coming and we are in for the recession at full price.

Bear Gang : He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat is what he does. Now, JPOW, I'm gonna ask you one last goddamn time, if you still respectfully refuse, I'm callin' the Bear Jew over. He's gonna take that big bat of his, and he's gonna beat your ass to death with it. Now, take your bull retard lickin' finger and point out on this map what I want to know.

JPOW : [after brief pause]  Fuck you... and your Gay Bears!"

2020-06-25 03:55:49,freehouse_throwaway,9,"my rona bear play if reopening ever hits a real snag. both  RH and LULU made me retarded amounts during the feb/march dive.

* RH puts. the valuation is nuts and they are saying they're gonna expand into bullshit like hospitality and restaurants (the fuck). problem is Jan puts are already pricing in either a total collapse or further short squeeze. (WSM is a good alt candidate too if you dont want the crazy option premiums). they've paused their buyback program so a lot of this valuation was driven by short squeeze and reopening rally. % float short has reduced signiifncalty from 30% to 22% from end of May to Mid June.

* LULU puts. betting against becky made me tons during the first dive and lost me tons during the rally. current valuation is ridiculous and their last ER shows that DTC can only carry them so much. being a pretty woke brand, they are the type of retailer to consider reclosing if rona gets outta control. positive catalyst continues to be online growth, men's line, and international expansion (Asian stores are all gucci, so only the US can fuck this up).

other plays to consider:

* W short shares: Wayfair is a rough oen and its a rona fav even though their ER continues to be dogshit. put premiums are pricing in collapse so its gonna be tough to time this one unless you're willing to pay big bucks for time and go with a debit spread. shorting shares seems better. short float % is still significantly high.

* BBBY short shares: i think this is an easy one not just in rona reopening fail but in actual economic impact. cheap debt may make them out live your short share position tho. they are a good short if they go above $12 imo.

* MIK short shares: any price point above $8~$10 is worth considering imo. this thing crater to $1 and has recover quite a bit. positive catalyst: current ""newish"" CEO is from TGT and was working on restructure and a path to house brand to make $$$ before rona hit. negative catalyst: reality of situation and a post COVID world. they were up 56% earlier this month during reopening hype as small caps really started roaring back but has faded quite a bit.

all of these might be moot tho as we're in a world of cheap money/debt. just ideas to consider if a correction ever happens."

Jerome shudders as he spills his ink inside me. Why not? There's no risk I'll use the ink to make copies of him like his wife might.

""Why do you hide who you are?""

I hear the exhaustion in his voice: ""Have you seen who I work for?""

His response, though logical, feels uselessly arrogant as I immediately wonder, *Well, why work for him?* After a sigh, he rolls to the edge of the bed and sleepily looks for his clothes.

""Why don't you stay the night?"" He slumps at my question, clearly feeling the weight and temptation of it, as tangibly as he feels the softness of my Egyptian cotton sheets.

""I have to get to the Mint."" He turns to me, and I see a crazed look in his eye. ""Today was red."" Suddenly, I notice he's not staring at me, but through me, to a place where gold is not the standard, sweat is. A place where God, if there ever was such a thing, has been replaced by a printer. ""Tomorrow won't be.""

2020-06-25 03:05:21,thalassamikra,9,"I've been trying to develop an understanding of the structural reasons for some of the market movements we see. Ever since the crash, share of foreign institutional ownership of US equities has increased a lot. Also, within the last few years passive indexing has really taken over within the US in a big way and actively managed funds and hedge funds have declined. 

All the overnight future trading is from European and Asian traders and I assume they are using the futures to hedge their US equity positions. If they are unwinding future hedges, they are probably selling off some equity positions. Unlike retail or active fund managers, passive indexes cannot really respond to any sharp action from overseas buyers or sellers by a counterbalance but simply follow the momentum and rebalance. 

Basically American markets are run remotely by European and Asian pj traders."

That being said, there are a bunch of near-term concerns / headwinds beyond COVID:

* Continued wave / 2nd wave COVID-19 continues to be cited - it feels like there is no political willpower to want to shutdown the economy again, so this risk is seems overblown; the real risk here is do the headlines cause enough worry that we to lose spending from parts of the population (particularly older people, who actually have significant portion of the assets / wealth) who self isolate / go into ""hermit"" mode
* Election risk - general consensus is that a blue wave (including presidency) would be terrible for markets since there would be high likelihood of increasing corporate taxes back to at least where they were before to fund spending; saw somewhere that this would shave 10%+ off EPS for the S&P next year; polls right now not looking good for Trump and Republicans given the social unrest, terrible job markets and general discontent with the handling of COVID; ironic thing is that it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, the more the market tanks, the more likely Trump is not re-elected, which tanks the markets more...
* End of quarter portfolio re-balancing - ironically, CNBC had a good article about this yesterday citing major banks estimating that quarter-end re-balancing of portfolios by pension funds, etc. could result in $30 - $75B being moved from equity markets to debt markets; not surprising given the crazy unexpected run-up in equity markets has thrown pension and institutional funds allocations askew, and they need to rebalance at the end of the quarter

I'm sure there are others - would be interested in hearing anything else I may be missing"

the most recent pre-print paper of a meta-analysis of 23 studies shows the [covid-19 death rate for people under the age of 70 in the USA is 0.04%](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v2.full.pdf)

the average annual death rate for the USA in 2017 across all age groups [under the age of 70 in is 0.4%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241572/death-rate-by-age-and-sex-in-the-us/)


[the mortality rate in 2017 for just being older than 75 is 4%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm)

[the mortality rate in 2017 for just being older than 85 is 13%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm). This is higher than the [8.6 % covid-19 death rate for people over 70.](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/30/what-explains-coronavirus-lethality-for-elderly/), and the exact same as the covid-19 death rate for [people over 85](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/30/what-explains-coronavirus-lethality-for-elderly/). This means the probability of dying from covid-19 for people above the age of 85 is equal to the probability of a person over the age of 85 dying in the year 2017.

Jerome shudders as he spills his ink inside me. Why not? There's no risk I'll use the ink to make copies of him like his wife might.

""Why do you hide who you are?""

I hear the exhaustion in his voice: ""Have you seen who I work for?""

His response, though logical, feels uselessly arrogant as I immediately wonder, *Well, why work for him?* After a sigh, he rolls to the edge of the bed and sleepily looks for his clothes.

""Why don't you stay the night?"" He slumps at my question, clearly feeling the weight and temptation of it, as tangibly as he feels the softness of my Egyptian cotton sheets.

""I have to get to the Mint."" He turns to me, and I see a crazed look in his eye. ""Today was red."" Suddenly, I notice he's not staring at me, but through me, to a place where gold is not the standard, sweat is. A place where God, if there ever was such a thing, has been replaced by a printer. ""Tomorrow won't be.""

End up at planned parenthood to try and get tested and the doctor literally argues with me for like an hour trying to STOP me from taking the test. Some shit about how a bunch of people have herpes and they wont test you without physical symptoms.They really dont want people knowing they have it. lol fuck off bitch, it's my dick. I can feel the burn. Anyways I was paying money to get tested so eventually they relented and turns out I dont have herpes either. Itch starts to go away and I retest months later to make sure im actually clean and all my test end up negative. I say fuck it and go back out there this time with a condom and afterwards my pubic region starts to burn and itch again. Turns out im allergic to the free condoms from the clinic."

Too soon to say on the shit load of dahlias we planted. Those assholes are fickle. I also helped my mom launch an online class on floral designing for weddings and events, and we got more students than I anticipated (because of COVID's impact on the industry), and I'm excited about training them.

There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and those 2% savings accounts. 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz. Go for the millions.

Looks like a pause in overall buying since the Quad Witch, which blew out almost 4 trillion in Gamma - and another 2 Trillion loss of Gamma Exposure from yesterday to today. 

The put call ratio plummeted from 2.01 to 1.47, which signals that large players closed their puts today in anticipation of better than expected ( lol ) economic data thru the rest of the week.

[10 Year Bond Yields: -5% Today](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-tilt-higher-as-bond-market-shrugs-off-tariff-and-coronavirus-fears-2020-06-24), which typically means investors are indeed fleeing into bonds at the moment. With a few major economic events coming up EOW, it seems most people are hiding out in the bond market until the economic picture is more clear. If the data is bad, bonds are a good place to be, if the data is good - the loss is minimal, and the jump to equities is easy to make, especially at these currently discounted prices.

&#x200B;

* **Fundamentals:**

Fundamentally we have US GDP QoQ estimates tomorrow, Fed has said recently that the economy is recovering much faster than expected. [They've actually only shelled out 6% of their total 2.3 Trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/24/the-fed-said-it-could-supply-the-economy-with-2point3-trillion-it-hasnt-come-close-so-far.html) they've committed to assist economic recovery. 

[Bank stress test results](https://www.barrons.com/articles/toughened-bank-stress-tests-are-coming-this-thursday-dont-expect-clarity-on-dividends-51593003490) should be in EOW - [there have been no repo bids at all this week](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000), which should signal that banks have sufficient liquidity and cash reserves. [Deposits are up overall as well.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bank-deposits-since-coronavirus-us-grown-trillion-amid-crisis-2020-6-1029330309) Some are worried banks may pull dividends, valid; but this wont be announced tomorrow as they've been instructed by the Fed to wait until 6/29 to announce any shareholder payout changes.

There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.

Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

Edit: The even bigger reason is other countries are going to start reacting to our failure to control the virus just like we are ""mad"" at China. Countries will isolate/ban our exports, and travel, and we won't be able to just print out of that. I see this is already started but other places that did act and acted hard (EU) will have no problem shutting us out if we refuse to mitigate the disease because we are crying about the economy."

2020-06-24 21:38:14,0_o,4,"I think this plunge is a slight overreaction.  Here are my thoughts, so we can make fun of me when I'm wrong:

This week, i picked up airline calls hoping to get in on the run up to the fourth of july, but picked the worst possible time to do it.  Hedged with 3x PLAY 16p 7/10 and 313 spy put that I sold today, so I'm only down 100 end of day.

I doubled down on airlines and ended up with most of my yolo money on AAL 13.5c 7/2; UAL 38c 7/2; DAL 27c 7/2. All below break even, currently.

I'm thinking that tomorrow opens with a shit-load of panic buying and selling, spy down 302 within 2hrs of open, up end of day 307 thx to fomo buy the dip.  310 after close on friday, but only after hours.  I sold a few stocks that are unlikely to go up this week and put my last dollary-doos in spy 304c 6/30. 

So, basically Im fucked if shit doesn't go up by 7/2 lol.  If it shows any bit of gains, I'm liquidating all to bet spy 305c 7/6"

2020-06-24 21:26:38,ButtFart88,-10,"Here‚Äôs a non-doomer explanation I‚Äôve been right about everything in Covid so far (because the data is fucking easy to track if you claim to follow stock pattens but can‚Äôt follow piss easy Corona patterns you‚Äôre a hack)

States have to under go a first wave. There is not a second wave happening. There is a first wave happening amongst different communities. The difference between the wave in Florida and New York is Florida quarantined the elderly so it‚Äôs basically just young people catching the virus.

Fact: lockdowns do nothing

Fact: protesting and groups are not different and viruses don‚Äôt know the difference

If you accept these facts the only explanation that explains the virus is that places like New York and Michigan has their first wave a long time ago, and that‚Äôs why cases keep dropping and why massive protests didn‚Äôt do a damn thing.

Texas, New York, Arizona, and California will get their first wave (they‚Äôre probably at the peak) and then cases will began plummeting extremely quickly.

Once Texas, Arizona, and Florida get their first wave the fun can really start. We‚Äôve seen that after a first wave hits nothing can get the cases to spike again. They‚Äôll be able to re open even more and we‚Äôll have the first fully re opened large states with cases trending downward. This could all play out entirely within a month. The peak could be past us as early as next week.

Combine that with even lower unemployment numbers in the next jobs report and shit is bullish af

I thanked him and asked if he was a doctor and he said ""who needs doctors when we have our fellow Americans, the ones who are here legally I mean."" I hugged him and threw my mask on the ground. The Star Spangled Banner played on the speaker system as everyone in the store ripped off their masks and threw them on the ground, chanting ""down with communism!""

US exports jumped this week

Rig count still low

Gasoline usage going up

Those Saudi imports into the US are winding down and they cut off a most of their exports to the US that will be felt mid July 

If we can get spared from states closing down, July is going to be a good month for oil. Hop on in"

2020-06-24 20:28:46,GabrielGra,63,"*This is a lot of writing (for this sub).. but worth the read. It's from an analyst I know and respect who handles a lot of money:*

Today‚Äôs market decline is bringing about fear of a more dramatic decline like what happened in March.¬† As you know, we have expected a multiweek consolidation that began June 5th after the S&P 500 (SPX) exceeded our near-term target of 3150.¬† At that point we highlighted there should be times where the market feels like it is going to just keep ramping and times where it might feel like it is collapsing ‚Äì and sometimes this might even happen on the same day!

We are looking to add risk during periods of weakness toward SPX 3000 in the economic reopening theme because there are basically three differences between now and what led to the decline from Mid-March to the March 23rdlow:

* **Covid-19 pandemic.**¬† Prior to the last push lower in March, we still did not know what Covid-19 was, how it transmitted, whether it would overwhelm our healthcare system, the mortality rate if you got it, and how to mitigate the risks of getting it.¬† Today, there is a huge population of companies that are working on both a treatment drug if you have it, and a vaccine to prevent us from getting it.¬† We know more about how people get the virus¬† and the population most at risk.¬† We have significantly improved testing, and we know social distancing and wearing a face mask significantly reduce the likelihood of either spreading or getting the virus.¬† 
* **Economic outlook.**¬† In mid-March, we had no idea how long the economic shutdown would last and now we know the worst is behind us, and while the economic reopening is clearly going to be choppy given renewed fear of Covid-19, the Monetary and Fiscal stimulus offered should allow for continued growth as the economy reopens.¬† It is important to remember the Fed and Washington D.C. have promised even more stimulus because they expect an unpredictable recovery, and the current environment only reinforces that extra help is likely needed.
* **Monetary policy.**¬† As the impact of the Covid-19 shutdown was beginning to play out, (1) credit was shutting down, (2) financial conditions were tightening, and (3) the Fed was unclear in the direction and extent of stimulus measures.¬† Today, the Federal Reserve Chair literally has said there is no dollar limit to the support of credit until a sustainable recovery is achieved and looked into the CBS *60 Minutes* camera and said they were printing money for the foreseeable future.¬† 

**Summary ‚Äì We want to add risk on periods of weakness as the consolidation plays out.** The market swings have been at lightning speed, and we believe many of the uncertainties that typically surround a crisis are on the path to recovery, albeit a choppy one pending broad distribution of a vaccine once approved. Our view since the April FOMC meeting has been to follow the Fed because they print the money and are actually putting it to work. We continue to expect the market to spend the next few weeks in consolidation mode and would add to the economic reopening sectors on weakness toward SPX 3000. There is an incredible amount of money that has been put into the system, and once there is a true reopening we expect that money to be put to work quickly as we move through 2021.

**TLDR: Chill out.. we aren't retesting March lows. Buy equities, leaps or monthlies.**"

Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: ""Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales.""   

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.
