BA  You have to think like institutions. They sold out to bring this down a massive 5.5% drop. Then waited for a statement by BA. Bought the shares at $305 for a bargain 5.5% cheaper. Remember, that 5.5% is millions upon millions of profit for them. It was obviously rejected at $305 and brought up to $313 before market close. DOW has gapped up 103 points. Those institutions will make a tremendous amount of money tomorrow,  by it gapping up to follow the DOW.  I would imagine it hit around $315 to $318.

2020-01-22 04:26:18,TimAppleBurner,8,"Just finished binge watching the Netflix series on Aaron Hernandez. I gotta say, Netflix is on a serious roll here pumping out some really quality content. I have yet to see what Apple TV will end up doing, it’s not inconceivable that it grows and competes with NFLX one day. Disney+ in my mind is going to struggle the most: they are limited to Disney properties. Which is fine, but once you cycle through your first two marvel seasons and Star Wars seasons, what else is there going to be? 

Disney’s not really the type to pump out documentaries. So not sure how the longevity of it is going to last. 

And as far as the NFLX doc, man. What a sad story overall. So many different issues with that guy. But really thorough and well done job. I’ll be curious to see what else Netflix can come up with."

2020-01-22 04:21:35,uninfinity,3,"   **Bezos' Phone Was Likely Hacked by Chat Account Linked to Saudi Prince, Audit Finds**   

 

WASHINGTON -- Cybersecurity experts hired by Amazon.com        Inc. founder Jeff Bezos have alleged that his        phone was probably hacked in 2018 by a WhatsApp account associated with        Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to a        person familiar with the matter.     

A forensic audit of Mr. Bezos' phone by FTI        Consulting, a business advisory group based in Washington,        found with "" medium to high confidence"" that the device began leaking        data shortly after being sent a video file from the WhatsApp account        linked to Prince Mohammed, the person said, as part of        an operation that siphoned information for months.     

Some officials at the United Nations have viewed the report        by FTI Consulting and are        expected to publicly announce some of the findings as soon as Wednesday,        the person said."

2020-01-22 02:27:39,knotswag,12,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

I was so busy at work I didn't switch my BA calls to puts during mid-dday as I had planned. Just checked BA's drop and my portfolio. Not a good day for me. Hope it was better for all of you.

That aside, looking at the charts [we traded in the range predicted Friday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq5jxu/weekend_discussion_thread_january_1719_2020/feosd04/) Ranges for tomorrow are 330.2-334.2. Futures are doing nicely and NFLX has done well, so I don't expect us to fall break trend (i.e fall below 330.2) tomorrow and should open green. 

Now we're waiting for the other FAAMG stocks to release, most of them being next week. INTC, which is the 6th largest holding of Nasdaq, releases Thursday. INTC is setting up in a bearish manner (previous PPO/RSI divergences during stock highs since 2018 has led to pullbacks to ~43), so I expect if there's a miss it'll pull down some of the pump we may see tomorrow. Until those earnings release though I expect us to be in our rising trend.

See you all tomorrow and touch your tendies carefully."

The only thing we don't know is what Tesla's margins were like so that will be the only determining factor when earnings are announced. If they found some unexpected government credit or found a way of cutting costs drastically, they will beat the estimates, otherwise they will be very close. Stock will probably move ~2-3% and it will come with a huge IV crash since option traders are betting that TSLA will move about 15% that day. I don't really expect them to announce something that could move the stock up or down 15% unless they say ""oops we actually lied big time about the delivery numbers""."
