2020-01-27 11:30:42,niceguy897,3,"hey guys, a lot of people [downvoted me there](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et8xus/daily_discussion_thread_january_24_2020/fffi68s/?context=3), but i turned out to be right after all this shit. yet i don't give a fuck about being right. i reference it so maybe you can just listen.

according to only study we have, this virus has a r0 of 2.5 which means every infected person infects another 2.5 people during the course of the disease. we don't have a vaccine or drug and we need to decrease this number to <1 somehow. quarantines might do well and i guess they will have at least some impact on this number.

the problem is this infection has 2 weeks incubation period and it's said its contagious during its incubation. but it might not be contagious as it is after the incubation period. **infectiousness most probably varies for each patient and according to course of the disease.**

yet i still don't give a fuck, **there are a lot of people out there, they are infected but in the incubation period. so they seem completely health for now.** and 30% increase by day won't decrease for at least a week because people in the incubation period will start to get sick in the next 2 weeks.

**incubation period makes it so hard to catch these patients at the airports.** thermal cameras most probably suck. if you notice 5 america cases and 2 of 3 france cases freely passed from airports and then they applied to their doctors.

[also if you check this map](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), you can see nearly all chinese cities are retardedly infected. our governments sucks dicks by not closing airports to chinese flights.

**summary: numbers won't decrease for at least 1 week and they will keep increasing at this speed.**"

Then the markets will stabilize on Tuesday a bit. Aapl will release earnings and analysts like Dan Ives will rave about how aapl is the best stock in the whole world or whatever. Then, fomo will hit hard because people realize that we’re in a temporary dip and that huge tech companies are doing well. Msft will probably also have a huge gain along with amd since they haven’t had any pre-er run-up. Analysts will just stfu for once and pump everything because they know that the market cannot sustain aapl and msft going down. Eventually, we’ll end the week with a 2 percent gain for spy. Then, the Chinese markets will reopen and they will be blood red because the Chinese retail investors actually know how bad the state of things are in their country. The US markets will have a flash crash like they did back in 2015 when the Chinese markets crashed 8% in one day and we’ll enter the February sell-off. Then, analysts will be like this is like the Feb 2018 sell-off that happened because markets were stretched. Most of wsb will lose all their money and the price of ropes will go up."

1. Earnings this week go well

2. Impeachment drags on (more time = more risk)
3. Earnings this week do not go well
4. Virus spreads
5. Iran tensions heat back up 
6. Yield curve inverts

[NQ support zone](https://imgur.com/gallery/AXGvexk)

This quarter, 73% of companies have reported a positive EPS suprise. Big tech companies coming out next week, if the general rule follows 4/5 should be positive suprise. I expect a drop tomorrow if we open at this level down to support zones, and then these will areas should act as a bounce due to earnings. Should play NQ/QQQ since it's tech next week. Also right now ES is on support and you can tell it's trying to move tech up but tech is a lot further from any support. Expect tech to dump tonight/early tomorrow.  

TLDR: buy calls if it dips. If it doesn't, not worth. Also if it dips big into tomorrow, look for morning hourly low to be set ( first 30 mins)"

 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-prince-courted-amazons-bezos-before-bitter-split-11580087674](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-prince-courted-amazons-bezos-before-bitter-split-11580087674) 

*Through much of 2018, Amazon.com        Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and tech-savvy Saudi        Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seemed to be hitting        it off.*     

*Texting over WhatsApp about a plan for Amazon        to build a huge data center in Saudi        Arabia, the men forged a cordial and mutually beneficial        relationship. ""It is very important for me, my friend, that you come to        Saudi during the future investment Forum and we announce this $2.8B        Vision 2030 partnership,"" the prince messaged Mr. Bezos on Sept.        9, 2018, according to a review of texts by The Wall Street        Journal and people familiar with the situation.*     

*Amazon stood to gain broader access to the Middle Eastern market. Prince        Mohammed could be aided in his efforts to reform the Saudi        economy as well as burnish his personal brand.*     

*Now, one of the world's richest men and one of the most powerful princes        are archenemies, each accusing the other of betrayal.*"

I can still remember how

That market used to make me smile

And I knew if I had my chance

That I could make those people dance

And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But January made me shiver

With every paper I'd deliver

Bad news on the doorstep

I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried

When I read about kobys widowed bride

Something touched me deep inside

The day the market died

So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

And them good ole 🐂s were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die"

Oh, beautiful release


Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here


From this dark, cold, hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie

And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn

We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death

The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles

It went like this:

The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair

The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze

I said: ""kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days""

You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
Like a daydream or a fever

We woke up one morning and fell a little further down -
For sure it's the valley of death

I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood"
