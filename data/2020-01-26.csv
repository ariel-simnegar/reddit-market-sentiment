2020-01-27 11:30:42,niceguy897,2,"hey guys, a lot of people [downvoted me there](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et8xus/daily_discussion_thread_january_24_2020/fffi68s/?context=3), but i turned out to be right after all this shit. yet i don't give a fuck about being right. i reference it so maybe you can just listen.

according to only study we have, this virus has a r0 of 2.5 which means every infected person infects another 2.5 people during the course of the disease. we don't have a vaccine or drug and we need to decrease this number to <1 somehow. quarantines might do well and i guess they will have at least some impact on this number.

the problem is this infection has 2 weeks incubation period and it's said its contagious during its incubation. but it might not be contagious as it is after the incubation period. **infectiousness most probably varies for each patient and according to course of the disease.**

yet i still don't give a fuck, **there are a lot of people out there, they are infected but in the incubation period. so they seem completely health for now.** and 30% increase by day won't decrease for at least a week because people in the incubation period will start to get sick in the next 2 weeks.

**incubation period makes it so hard to catch these patients at the airports.** thermal cameras most probably suck. if you notice 5 america cases and 2 of 3 france cases freely passed from airports and then they applied to their doctors.

[also if you check this map](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), you can see nearly all chinese cities are retardedly infected. our governments sucks dicks by not closing airports to chinese flights.

**summary: numbers won't decrease for at least 1 week and they will keep increasing at this speed.**"
