So a lot of them are panicking and I do not know if government actually knows what to do. They know they cant be in quarantine for 3 months and have economy and they also know they cant go out like business is okay  because they will get more people sick again. 

Its a catch 22 and economy at least in Europe will be on downtrend until vaccine comes. Which is 2021. Which means economies will be devastated. 

Airlines in EU said they can function with limited demand for 2 months but after that they are bankrupt.

Boeing, Airbus will likely have very limited orders this year/next year

Likely 70% of companies will go bankrupt if something doesnt change in Europe"

To that end, google searches such as ‚ÄúTesla bankrupt‚Äù, ‚ÄúElon AIDS‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Model Y is a cancer on society and endangers all life on earth‚Äù should enlighten you as to the perilous business realities of Tesla. 

With you best interests at heart, I enjoin you to liquidate your Tesla holdings without delay‚Äîor at the very least before 4/9‚Äî so that this üåàüêªcan make a ten bagger on his Tesla puts.

Your humble servant,

A big üåàüêª"

2020-04-02 03:52:15,iheartfrodo_69,15,"So let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a whale. Maybe even just a big swordfish. Do you care about the little hermit crabs eating the scraps that fall down to the seabed? You don‚Äôt. If you and your friends were about to pull out into cash, would you want to sell HIGH or sell LOW? Futures pumping is important, but don‚Äôt look at why because who cares. Look at the technical analysis, not the fundamentals-the effect, not the cause. We have math and physics on team TA. We broke a traditionally very very firm support today, in one day, and the overall movements in interday trading formed absolutely no indicators we will suddenly moon. Futures pumping green? Good. Just tells me that the rich folk are positioning themselves to sell soon.

Edit: Holy shit in the DMs; I don‚Äôt know if your 4/3 199 puts will print?? There are so many smart people on the sub, and they gave us weeks to months worth of hand picked knowledge to start on. We broke the support, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt test it a couple more times, and it doesn‚Äôt mean we plummet through the rest. We move in ZIG ZAGS. We had lower and lower highs and lower and lower lows all day long, and we tested the 247 support (or resistance) line a couple times successfully on the ONE MINUTE chart. We closed under it, once on the daily. Just hang tight, and if you‚Äôre seriously that anxious then you put in way too much money."

2020-04-01 23:31:39,medthrowaway68,6,"Solid DD on Defense Stocks: TXT CALL $40 06/19/20

I‚Äôm sick of these shitty DDs and wanted to shed some light on a possible opportunity in defense stocks. Don‚Äôt fucking ask me any shitty questions‚Äì I‚Äôm not your fucking financial advisor. Grow a pair and stick to a position, then hold it.

I got in on TXT Calls at $40 expiring on 06/19/20 before market close. I had a feeling Trump would announce some sort of military move in order to pump the market. Now that the US will be deploying troops to Venezuela, it‚Äôs a good time to get in on defense calls, especially considering the fact that the U.S. defense companies are still actively winning contracts despite the fact that many factories are shut down. 

Textron is a direct competitor of Lockheed. Why not options on Lockheed instead of Textron? Well, your mom‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs wallet can‚Äôt afford a call option on Lockheed. Also, Textron volume is on the rise. Additionally, whenever BA and other defense stocks rise, Textron rises proportionately given the fact that they still have active contracts with the U.S.

Currently, Lockheed and Textron are battling for several Air contracts. Combined with the fact that Textron will be able to maintain a revenue stream as well as the fact that the military industry complex is deemed an essential business and will soon be up and running far before and quicker than any retail stock possibly can, getting in on a TXT call early on is a gold opportunity. 

Happy National Autism Month

TLDR: TXT CALLS $40 06/19/20"

2020-04-01 22:57:43,medthrowaway68,4,"Solid DD on Defense Stocks: TXT CALL $40 06/19/20

I‚Äôm sick of these shitty DDs and wanted to shed some light on a possible opportunity in defense stocks. Don‚Äôt fucking ask me any shitty questions‚Äì I‚Äôm not your fucking financial advisor. Grow a pair and stick to a position, then hold it.

I got in on TXT Calls at $40 expiring on 06/19/20 before market close. I had a feeling Trump would announce some sort of military move in order to pump the market. Now that the US will be deploying troops to Venezuela, it‚Äôs a good time to get in on defense calls, especially considering the fact that the U.S. defense companies are still actively winning contracts despite the fact that many factories are shut down. 

Textron is a direct competitor of Lockheed. Why not options on Lockheed instead of Textron? Well, your mom‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs wallet can‚Äôt afford a call option on Lockheed. Also, Textron volume is on the rise. Additionally, whenever BA and other defense stocks rise, Textron rises proportionately given the fact that they still have active contracts with the U.S.

Currently, Lockheed and Textron are battling for several Air contracts. Combined with the fact that Textron will be able to maintain a revenue stream as well as the fact that the military industry complex is deemed an essential business and will soon be up and running far before and quicker than any retail stock possibly can, getting in on a TXT call early on is a gold opportunity. 

Happy National Autism Month

TLDR: TXT CALLS $40 06/19/20"

This covid-19 model and projections have been shared around a lot. I‚Äôm guilt of sharing it too because it paints an optimistic picture for many states: that they should be able to handle the spike of new patients with their current ICU/ventilator capacity.

But this model is built around the assumption that we are shelling in place at the same level as Wuhan, China did. 1. We know we are not. 2. We also don‚Äôt really believe the Chinese numbers. 

So please be careful about this model. This tweet thread explains more: [https://twitter.com/CT\_Bergstrom/status/1243819232950751233](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1243819232950751233)

2020-04-01 21:50:15,straightCrimpin,6,"Writing this down so I can re-read it tomorrow and not make the mistakes I did today.

Thoughts - After 6 trading days of running up we finally broke out of the short term uptrend with today's gap down and dip. Resistance level of $251 held, but so did support level of $244. Tomorrow's action will be depend heavily on where we open tomorrow.

* Open above $251 - Bullish. Expect us to come down to $251, possibly $250 before going higher, target $253.6 followed by $256. Off the table if we trade below $249.

* Open below $244 - Bearish. Expect a morning retest of $244 before going lower. Downside target of $240 followed by $234. Off the table if we trade above $246.

* Open between $251 and $244 - Neutral to bullish. Base actions on pre-market strength/weakness. After a day like today with relatively low volume selling, follow through is needed to confirm the bearish price movement. Without convincing follow through the odds of us turning back around and going higher increase. Look for strong movements above $250 for upside, or below $246 for downside.

More thoughts - Throughout this whole downtrend there has only been 3 areas with consecutive red daily candles. The first was the start of the move, where we had 6 red daily candles. The 2nd looked a lot like the last two days and occurred on 3/11 and 3/12 with a large gap down separating days. The third was 3/20 and 3/23, which marked the bottom. Yesterday and today makes the 4th area with 2 consecutive red candles. This time may be more similar to the first time, where we don't gap much overnight but trade consistently lower and end up with 3 or 4 red candles. If we do have a big gap down, like if we gap to $234, the odds favor a green candle and we should probably go long to $240, possibly $244.

TL-DR; Big gap up = go long for the day. Big gap down = go long for the day. Flat (slight gap up or down) = go short for the day, ideally at a resistance level."

**So if you are here for a lotto jackpot 20x position. downvote this and move along. But if, you are here and looking for a sustainable way to generate cash, keep reading.**

I posted this last week and will keep posting until yall listen! (If you already read it sorry for this wall of text again.)

First, There is no good in being perma bears or bulls that is so fucking stupid the only gang that you want to join is **PRINTING GANG**

Second, This is what I made today [+$43,966.04](https://i.imgur.com/Bvq2mfR.png), YES I MADE MONEY ON BOTH PUTS AND CALLS TODAY and This year so far [+$359,264.01](https://i.imgur.com/EuGU7nt.png) which on average I made 3.48% per trade so **DON'T GET FUCKING GREEDY** and **TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROFIT**.

Third, I have day traded options for about 14 years since I was 22. Right now the market is **ONCE IN A LIFETIME** opportunity. Like my man EMINEM once said *""Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo""* so don't let it fucking slip.

**DO**

 - Get in and get out don't be fucking greedy.
 - Have an entry and exit price in mind before you open the fucking trade. So learn how to cut losses and take the profit.
 - If you made a bad trade. Get the fuck out, cut losses and try again, Don't fucking bagholding it and pray. God is not real. Santa is also not real.
 - Learn your greeks if you don't know what it is just fucking BING IT.
 - Keep in your mind that if you trading options without any underlying then you are **GAMBLING**. This is not investing and stop calling your bankroll ""portfolio"".
 - If you are degenerate gambler like me this is what I do with my bankroll. I put whatever I feel comfortable losing in my trading account. The rest I keep in my checking account (separate institution). So when my retard brain tell me to do stupid shit, I don't lost it all. By the time I need to move more money into my bankroll, my head will be cleared (hopefully) and stop doing stupid shit.

**DON'T**

 - **DON'T GAMBLE MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE** It's sad that I have to say this. Use the fucking money on important first, rent, mortgage, car payment, food, etc.
 - DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT be **H**orrified **O**f **M**issing **O**ut. Just remember that it is better making no money than losing money so assess the market before make a fucking trade.
 - Don't fucking all in, this is not a world poker series. There is no such a thing as a sure trade.
 - If you win on one trade. It is already your money. Don't use your tard brain and think that now you are gambling with a house money.
 - Don't be a MONEY HATER person. Let's say your position drop 50%, assess it. Imagine that if you have the money now, Would you get in to this position at this market price. If the answer is no, then cut the loss and exit the position. **IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT** What matter is what it will be in the future.
 - Stop using fucking robinhood and use any real broker. I use Charlie's most of my trading friend use IBKR
 - Don't be fucking poor go find $25,000 and day trade if you don't have $25,000 then go live your live until you have it.

Good fucking luck and Happy Gambling

Looking for reentry by EOW with some ITM & 2-5 Strikes OTM 6/19 Puts-- hopefully during a sideways trend following a pump for a lower level of volatility! 

Plan to ride out the approaching carnage, and rack up 100%+ gains to push me into the six figure club!
