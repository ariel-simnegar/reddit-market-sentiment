According to Borrell, the relationship between the US and the bloc was impacted by Trump's attacks on the EU, as the gap between their approaches to different challenges widened. He pointed out that while EU is closer to the US than it is to China, ""it's clear that we don't have the same kind of systematic confrontation"" with the Asian country as Washington."

There is a lot of swift action towards EOD on Fridays, which is what I am going to try to capture. Problem is that my thesis is that we are in the early stages of a multi-year bull run, so I do not think EOD puts might be the move, but I also don't think EOD calls will provide the necessary price movement to capture 300%.

#its your boy chimpu back with some daily update and insights

#_________________________


Asia is in a bullish tone this entire week, and majority of their indices are extending gains today

India 1.5 % up

Nikkie 0.7 % up


Europe after few flat days refuses to give away any gains and still holding the gains currently in Futures

#__________________________

#Spy

Majority of the week spy respected it's support and resistance giving it a Bullish stance for the next week


Major support has shifted to 309 from 307, giving some bullish signals


Major resistance remains at 315, a sequence on flat top and higher lows giving away they indication of upward breakout


#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 310 and 315 with a possibility of breakout on the cards tend to be forming which is most likely going to be upwards

Trade plan changes a bit different today as carrying position through the weekend may turn out profitable, looking forward to building long position if spy gives an opportunity at 310 zone

#__________________________


It was previously recommended to have many trades with small profits, but the play on short side seems to over


#Prior said that Nasdaq will take a breather each time it hits 10k, person bias observation suggests that Nasdaq has consolidated this entire week between 9500 - 10000 and is being set up for upward breakout

#___________________________


Long term : people looking to build long term portfolio, chart suggest that we are still bullish with vix making new lows on long charts and major indices still on uptrend, as usual invest in SIP mode to take advantage of this volitality

#__________________________


Random tip of the day : "" See stock prices on a different application cause seeing it at yours broker might influence you in the way that may blind you ""


A change from cantractionary market to expansionary market is very much likely, this will be confirmed when spy breaks out from 307 - 315 channel, personal bias is that 315 is going to be taken out sooner than later

Asia is in a bullish tone this entire week, and majority of their indices are extending gains today

India 1 % up

Nikkie 0.7 % up


Europe after few flat days refuses to give away any gains and still holding the gains currently in Futures

#Spy

Majority of the week spy respected it's support and resistance giving it a Bullish stance for the next week


Major support has shifted to 309 from 307, giving some bullish signals


Major resistance remains at 315, a sequence on flat top and higher lows giving away they indication of upward breakout


#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 310 and 315 with a possibility of breakout on the cards tend to be forming which is most likely going to be upwards

Trade plan changes a bit different today as carrying position through the weekend may turn out profitable, looking forward to building long position if spy gives an opportunity at 310 zone


It was previously recommended to have many trades with small profits, but the play on short side seems to over


#Prior said that Nasdaq will take a breather each time it hits 10k, person bias observation suggests that Nasdaq has consolidated this entire week between 9500 - 10000 and is being set up for upward breakout


Long term : people looking to build long term portfolio, chart suggest that we are still bullish with vix making new lows on long charts and major indices still on uptrend, as usual invest in SIP mode to take advantage of this volitality


Random tip of the day : "" See stock prices on a different application cause seeing it at yours broker might influence you in the way that may blind you ""


A change from cantractionary market to expansionary market is very much likely, this will be confirmed when spy breaks out from 307 - 315 channel, personal bias is that 315 is going to be taken out sooner than later

not an autist believed that stonks could go up

the quad witching they said

if in a bull market stonk goes up, then in a bear stonk will drop

iirc stonk went up, everyone had puts

this time most of you got calls,  guaranteed stonk will drop

if stonk rallies during the day double down on puts

2020-06-19 06:32:50,smallchimpu,15,"#its your boy chimpu back with some daily update and insights


Asia is in a bullish tone this entire week, and majority of their indices are extending gains today

India 1 % up

Nikkie 0.7 % up


Europe after few flat days refuses to give away any gains and still holding the gains currently in Futures

#Spy

Majority of the week spy respected it's support and resistance giving it a Bullish stance for the next week


Major support has shifted to 309 from 307, giving some bullish signals


Major resistance remains at 315, a sequence on flat top and higher lows giving away they indication of upward breakout


#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 310 and 315 with a possibility of breakout on the cards tend to be forming which is most likely going to be upwards

Trade plan changes a bit different today as carrying position through the weekend may turn out profitable, looking forward to building long position if spy gives an opportunity at 310 zone


It was previously recommended to have many trades with small profits, but the play on short side seems to over


#Prior said that Nasdaq will take a breather each time it hits 10k, person bias observation suggests that Nasdaq has consolidated this entire week between 9500 - 10000 and is being set up for upward breakout


Long term : people looking to build long term portfolio, chart suggest that we are still bullish with vix making new lows on long charts and major indices still on uptrend, as usual invest in SIP mode to take advantage of this volitality


Random tip of the day : "" See stock prices on a different application cause seeing it at yours broker might influence you in the way that may blind you ""


A change from cantractionary market to expansionary market is very much likely, this will be confirmed when spy breaks out from 307 - 315 channel, personal bias is that 315 is going to be taken out sooner than later

2020-06-19 06:20:01,namsilat,13,"For those of you who don't know and are afraid to ask, ""Quad Witching"" simply refers to one of 4 days a year when stonk options, index options, single stock futures contacts and index futures all expire on the same day.

Historically, you'll see lots of volatility on quad witching days, and markets close moderately up a slight majority of the time. The market on the week following quad witchings are down a slight majority of the time.

What's been interesting about this quad witching is that the markets went fucking nutso just about a week before.  thrashing up and down but following a barely up trend, which made options holders premiums worth less as overall volatility dropped allowing theta gang to keep more. This also shook out entrenched positions among options holders, allowing their value to depress further.


I think this wierdo consolidation trend is market manipulation by MMs.  I also think we're either going to fucking nose dive or skyrocket immediately afterwards.  ITM VXX strangles or leveraged ETF (dow based would be my preference, I think dow has the most swing in it) strangles might be a good play on monday or tuesday.  Once the direction of the market is known, you can sell out the unprofitable leg."

I also have some alternative investments. Unmentionable on this sub.

I don't do options. I don't know enough greek letters. I like the old fashioned buy the shares. Hold those sweet share certificates. I like get spammed by physical mail asking me to vote on board members, and burning that paper for heat, to save on electric bills. That's my dividend brothers. All good stuff.

Worst of all, that's not even the most frightening part. The most horrific thing about watching myself die almost every night is the fact that I wasn't even a HUMAN. No, I was actually a BEAR. Thousands of dreams, and not a single one where I'm not a bear getting shot by hunters, falling out of a tree, drowning, you name it! I died every single way imaginable. Even surrounded by loved ones.

Now you might be thinking, ""Huh, being a bear can't be that bad. How is that worse than watching yourself die?"". Well...It's because I finally learned the ultimate reason as to why I became a human in this life....and it's because in this body, I'm the most **bearish** man on earth and my portfolio is down 85% trading puts.

2020-06-19 04:20:05,Huckleberry_Ginn,25,"Genuinely, the flat days show something is happening. There is so much uncertainty that no one wants to do anything. Sure, the price is where it is but there is a TON of cash sitting on the sidelines. 

The flat days this week were waiting to hear about wave 2. Wave 1 is priced, the recovery from wave 1 is well understood - Powell said this. Wave 2, however, is not priced in - Powell said this. 

The Fed’s switch from bond ETFs to individual bond by the fed on Monday barely bumped the market. Previous bond announcement literally dug us out of hell. It placed protection in mega companies from default. This was also important to tailor aid, rather than buying an entire ETF. It’s important for the market; yet, it didn’t do much. Because people are SCARED. Look at vix, sure, low 30s isn’t high... look back and look at vix numbers relative. ITS HIGH. And, yet the market isn’t moving. 

I think there is a bloody, bloody day ahead with news like, “Arizona will reach hospital bed capacity June 27 to July 2” or some other headline will spark a circuit breaker day. It will probably be an over reaction for the first 2-3 days, but it will drop. Hard. 

The news cycle is pausing right now. Black lives matter is being focused on in real ways and the riots are fading. Juneteenth and trump rally will be fading... I think big headlines will pop tomorrow. Trump will also want news to overshadow the Bolton talk. 

I’m biased with my positions. And I may be self reinforcing. Any thoughts?

EDIT: TL:DR I believe the market will over react to wave 2 with a few trading days. I think tomorrow is a perfect storm, but I believe by end of next week we will have a panic sell."

>Let’s say that on a certain day the OCC reported that 8.82 million puts and 7.47 million calls traded, meaning the P/C ratio was 1.18 (or 8.82/7.47). According to some analysts, a P/C ratio below 0.75 signals high levels of bullish sentiment, so it’s considered bearish from a contrarian viewpoint. Between 0.75 and 1.00 is neutral.

It's fun to look back at [this post from Crescat Capital in March](https://www.crescat.net/this-is-it/) crowing about how their years-old thesis that we're in a bubble is finally being proven correct by ~~a global pandemic and economic shutdown~~ stonks are too damn high!

i love the audacity of this guy talking about how correct their analysis is and how we're heading for Great Depression 2.0 type crash and how much money they're going to make/have made. 

And now they're mad because the extraordinary interventions of fiscal policy and the Fed have pulled us back from the brink for now. Nevermind that as pointed out in that post, financial crashes become economic crashes.

Now they are slapping big fines on restaurants + bars that aren’t adhering to phase 2 guidelines. Fines they can’t afford. On top of that property taxes have increased 34 fucking % to cover the costs the city incurred due to COVID.

With lost wages, lost traffic, fines, tax hikes, lack of weekend travelers on top of the losses they already incurred from March to Mid-May. How the fuck is downtown USA going to survive this? Cities are going to be fucked.

Still the market continues to rise on empty promises. At some point (could be right around September / October the bottom is going to fall out of the service sector. And with it will come massive side effects that tech can’t carry alone.

As I run my finger down the condensation on the window in my Hertz rental car, I realize it's now or never. ""So, are you going to tell me your name?"" I feel his body tense, even though I'm not looking at him. After an extended silence, he says, ""No.""

I turn to him and see the drying sweat in his ringlets of brown hair. Suddenly, I feel like I'm ruining an options seller with early assignment. He wants to see how this romance rises and falls a bit longer. That's fair. But when does this contract expire?

""Okay,"" I say, even though it doesn't feel okay. ""But you know we can't do this forever."" He takes my comment literally and responds, ""Because this place is going bankrupt?"" He gestures at the green neon sign at the far side of the parking lot where we've been parked for hours. I don't tell him that I meant my heart can't do this forever, and I instead answer him seriously, ""It might not. A group of autistic investors are buying the worthless stock, keeping it afloat.""

""Then why can't we do this forever?""

This is an excerpt

The pros are shocked—shocked, they tell you—to find that there is gambling going on. Much of their ire is directed at the million-plus users of r/wallstreetbets, a Reddit forum where frat-boy argot is mixed with trading jargon. Its devotees are not the type to buy a stock based on a model of discounted cash flows. Instead they favour buying call options. A certain kind of call option—deeply out-of-the-money and close to expiry—is much like buying a lottery ticket or making a long-odds sports bet. They can pay off spectacularly for a relatively small outlay if the stock price suddenly surges."

1) buy up a bunch of equities, spiking price up 0.5%

2) set sell orders at the new price you've run up to

3) greedy bulls see the spike and FOMO into buying up your orders

4) when they run out of steam, you sell the rest of the stock purchased in step 1, down to the original purchase price

5) greedy bears or momentum traders see this as sell signal and keep selling

Tada! You've made a profit, and the price is lower.

Optionally, step 1.5 is ""favorable news dump"" and step 3.5 is ""unfavorable news dump""

This is why futures market tends to rise before it falls overnight, or vice versa. Also, read ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" to learn about more typical plays like this.

You’ll see them repost after the run that they called it with a pic of their discord. You don’t actually need to use discord because this strategy is about being late. Make sure the pumper has at least 10k followers. There’s 3 waves of pumpers, the ones who legit call it out and front load selling into the volume, the ones who show up right at the top who buy high and sell low and the ones who bought “the dip” who baghold and pump it for weeks/months until the can break even. You wanna get short when that second waves comes in. When you do it long enough you will recognize these accounts like it’s a classroom day after day different tickers. I don’t wanna drop any names because I don’t wanna give any possible clout or new followers. But it’s easy to spot bro. Tomorrow between 7 and 9 find the top 3 percentage gainers and watch those boards closely throughout the day. You’ll see the 3 waves come in. It will be a long day but it’s worth it to see how it play out all day. It won’t take long and you’ll literally be able to follow a few of them and jump right in and out of trades."

So i pick a stock I’m bearish in that’s currently $30 a share. Then I Buy a $20 7/17 put of the stock for $5 and Sell a $10 7/17 put of the stock for $1.

If the stock actually goes up and stays up to like $40, I keep the $100 premium from what I sold, and lose $500 from the put I bought becoming worthless. Total loss is $400.

If the stock goes down below 10, and the person who bought my put exercised it, I would then have to buy 100 shares of the stock at $10 each (so buying $1000 of stocks). Then I exercise the put I bought to sell the shares I just bought for $20 each (selling for $2000)? Is that right? 

what happens if the stock gets to $15 by expiry ? I keep the premium from what’s sold and then sell the put? When do I know the right time to sell ? Like if I sell before the person who bought my put exercised I’m fucked."

However, statistics such as requests for driving directions in Arizona and Texas suggest consumers are responding to the virus with less caution than they did three months ago, he added.""

They think less caution is bullish?  It just means that cases are going parabolic, then people are going to freak out when grandma dies.

Over the course of a quadruple witching day, transactions involving large blocks of contracts can create price movements that may provide arbitrageurs the opportunity to profit on temporary price distortions. [Arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) can rapidly escalate volume, particularly when high-volume round trips are repeated multiple times over the course of trading on quadruple witching days.

These two lines will converge overnight. If it breaks through to the downside of the smaller uptrend line that was forming, then tomorrow might test the 307-308 level and possibly the 295-300 level if the selling pressure picks up. If the downward trend line is broken to the upside, then tomorrow might test the 319-323 level. Either way, tomorrow should be interesting.

Edit: Revision after comparing with SPX - pattern is larger on SPX and the channel formed over the past couple days might continue throughout Friday.

2020-06-18 21:46:02,SolitaryEgg,10,"I actually believe in the ENPH scandal. I exited my positions, so I have no skin in the game, but the report is pretty convincing.

Basically they studied ENPH for two years, then went to India and spoke to a bunch of employees handling their books, and found tons of evidence of cooked books.

After they went to India and did this private investigation, ENPH executives and board members sold $120.9 million worth of ENPH shares in the span of just fifteen days from June 1st to June 15th, and ENPH's previous largest shareholder sold its entire ~11% stake in just one day on May 20th.

Then they release this report, and the stock plummets.

Then last night, someone from JPMorgan was like ""nah I don't think so, they seem legit to me,"" and now everyone just completely accepted that the original report was a scam, and the stock rallied today.

To me, it seems like if anyone is being sketchy, it's this JPMorgan analyst. There's no way he really could've done the DD in one day and investigate the claims to properly release a public statement against the initial report, and it seems super obvious he was just trying to prevent a continued sell-off.

Anyway, that's my retarded 2 cents."

Gang, the MM’s rule the roost.  Don’t forget it.  They managed to completely skull fuck volatility just before everyone’s options expire.  Now I don’t know if they say up or down after Friday. But I’m guessing down, because they’ve got us all believing this bullshit about a bubble.  It’s been a bubble since 09.  This is just a bubble they missed out on.

I look out the window. What was once fantasy in video games like Fallout: New Vegas have now become reality. Nuclear war. Trade wars and resource tensions have escalated to the point of no return. The bombs have fallen. I take shelter in my bunker.

I consume spam and eggs for dinner, for the upteenth time for over three decades. Is this finally the bear market rally? Surely, the market cannot survive a nuclear apocalypse. I open my Robinhood to check up on my puts, which I luckily dated for 2050, having bought them in the late 2000s.

..it couldn't be. SPY, at all time highs? But, how? It was foretold, a market crash during an apocalypse! I check the news to see why.

""Markets are forward-looking,"" said Cramer. ""The market is currently pricing in a full recovery by the 31st century.""

Thirty first..what? The 31st century? Surely, he was joking? The markets were pricing in a recovery of the human race over a thousand years from now?

I sell my puts. It is time to throw in the towel. I look down at my spam and eggs, consuming them, tears rolling down my face.

""Priced in,"" I mutter to myself. What utter hogwash."

US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Thursday he will oppose any attempt of the Trump administration to announce the COVID-19 vaccine by the November election unless the vaccine is ""safe and scientifically sound.""

In an interview with McClatchy, Fauci said he disapproved of the use of the term ""Operation Wrap Speed"", which is the name of the vaccine development project, as it incorrectly implies that critical scientific benchmarks for safety and effectiveness might be sidestepped in a government effort to get a vaccine as soon as possible.

Earlier in the month, Fauci said that a vaccine against the coronavirus could be developed either by the end of this year, or in the first few months of 2021."

United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the country's economy is experiencing a V-shaped recovery following a slump caused by coronavirus lockdowns.

Trump praised record monthly rises in jobs numbers and retail sales as the economy started to bounce back in May and insisted his administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) helped save as many as 50 million jobs during the pandemic.

The US president went on to claim the recovery is even steeper than a V-shape, ""almost I-shaped"" and asserted that many of ""smart Wall Streeters"" who hadn't initially believe his claims that a V-shaped recovery would be possible are slowly coming on board."

2020-06-18 20:34:48,namsilat,13,"Men, gather round, for I have come to speak my words.

Yes, our fitful ship of miscreants has sailed into the doldrums of a rangebound index.

Yes, market makers are closing in with their canon, they out number us, two to one.

Yes, our deck is swarming with kangaroo gang, our waters swarming with theta eels.

Times appear dark, indeed.


But out of such times, are not true men made?

Bulls! How long have I fought with you, side by side, horns flashing and glinting in profits. Led by a brigade of furious autists, how many of you have rode to Valhalla, snatched the gains of Zeus himself?

Bears! O worthy opponents.  Have the markets not felt the naked sting of your razor claws?  Have you not been felled by the massive dicks of the fed itself and yet risen anew.  We sing your songs, brave gay beasts.

Now is not the time of our undoing!  Market makers, hear my cries. With all the hate in my heart I spit calls at thee. Theta, I shall fuck thee with the Devine and righteous cock of thunderous profits! Roos! hear the slicing whisper of my murderous sword, The Dread Margin of Sherwood!!!!

Into the breach, my fellow tards! Leave no call unbought, no put unmolested.  For this is our time!  For our margin called brethren!  For tendies!

Buy that shiiiiiiit!!!!!!!!!!!"

Today when I tried to open WSB I got a message from reddit saying ""Couldn't connect to our CDN servers"", maybe reddit should consider one of these providers to help them out?

Literally the highways of the internet, how the fuck do you bet against that.

Cloudflare even got the crab guy, Steve Klabnik, all these millennial programmers with spare income love Rust even though they've never touched it, and by mere association with this person they are probably pouring their inflated Silicon Valley salaries into this stock.

Eastdakota, their CEO, seems solid and knows his shit, posts regularly on hackernews which probably makes these techies pour even more money into Cloudflare.

Fastly I don't know as much about it them but it seems to have even more retard strength. CEO has a ginger beard, this makes me think bullish. Bought shares, and my price target is 100. They have not yet opened options at the strike prices I would like."

Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: ""Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales.""   

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.  

The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy. A quiet rage flares behind your eyes, then fades to sadness.
