According to Borrell, the relationship between the US and the bloc was impacted by Trump's attacks on the EU, as the gap between their approaches to different challenges widened. He pointed out that while EU is closer to the US than it is to China, ""it's clear that we don't have the same kind of systematic confrontation"" with the Asian country as Washington."

There is a lot of swift action towards EOD on Fridays, which is what I am going to try to capture. Problem is that my thesis is that we are in the early stages of a multi-year bull run, so I do not think EOD puts might be the move, but I also don't think EOD calls will provide the necessary price movement to capture 300%.

#its your boy chimpu back with some daily update and insights

#_________________________


Asia is in a bullish tone this entire week, and majority of their indices are extending gains today

India 1.5 % up

Nikkie 0.7 % up


Europe after few flat days refuses to give away any gains and still holding the gains currently in Futures

#__________________________

#Spy

Majority of the week spy respected it's support and resistance giving it a Bullish stance for the next week


Major support has shifted to 309 from 307, giving some bullish signals


Major resistance remains at 315, a sequence on flat top and higher lows giving away they indication of upward breakout


#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 310 and 315 with a possibility of breakout on the cards tend to be forming which is most likely going to be upwards

Trade plan changes a bit different today as carrying position through the weekend may turn out profitable, looking forward to building long position if spy gives an opportunity at 310 zone

#__________________________


It was previously recommended to have many trades with small profits, but the play on short side seems to over


#Prior said that Nasdaq will take a breather each time it hits 10k, person bias observation suggests that Nasdaq has consolidated this entire week between 9500 - 10000 and is being set up for upward breakout

#___________________________


Long term : people looking to build long term portfolio, chart suggest that we are still bullish with vix making new lows on long charts and major indices still on uptrend, as usual invest in SIP mode to take advantage of this volitality

#__________________________


Random tip of the day : "" See stock prices on a different application cause seeing it at yours broker might influence you in the way that may blind you ""


A change from cantractionary market to expansionary market is very much likely, this will be confirmed when spy breaks out from 307 - 315 channel, personal bias is that 315 is going to be taken out sooner than later

2020-06-19 09:43:13,talent3d,2,"dumb question but I got stupid RobinHood and I know they sell your shit an hour before close to reduce their exposure

If I have both ITM calls, say +1 DKNG 30c and -1 DKNG 40c, do I need to close out position before RH tries to fuck me by selling at bid & buying at ask?

My Merrill account would just keep it and exercise it.  Don't know how RH do their shit since they hopped on my account before and close my shit 30min before close.  Thanks in advance."

TTOO has a 3 hour covid test flooding the market (fastest result by any current test).

2020-06-19 09:40:06,ElPatronDelDesierto,-21,"Seriously, if you work at taco bell I expect you are semi retarded...or just desperate for work. But how fucking hard is it to not fuck up putting cinnamon twist things in my bag instead of the chips that are supposed to come with the fucking NACHOS I ordered! I mean, thanks for trying I guess... but why would anyone want cinny twists with nacho sauce? Disappointing. Someone train these poor kids how to trade stonks, and let's get the robots flipping burgers for us so we can all enjoy makings tendies and taking humanity to the next level. 

Calls on humans if we can stop being devisive and just agree on a basic set of priciples and values as to fundamental human rights. One of which should be that everyone gets their rent paid and an opportunity to have some kind of job, and also equal access to play the ""stonks go up"" game...  everyone gets like unlimited lives is the form of annual $4k deposit in your tendie town account. This would be a beautiful world I would want to live in.  

Ok, I'm high as fuck... But boom look at the tiny dik on vix bye bye little fella. Time for some green candles. Futures don't always mean anything but VIX down 4.3% and climbing means we are looking to be climbing all Friday. It's buying day tomorrow boys!! Get that cash gang woken up, i can get a 1.2 hr nap in before premarket. Let's gooo"

Short answer: *yes*"
