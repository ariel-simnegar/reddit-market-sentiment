The bear thesis is that the virus will be a pandemic and effect supply chain, thus causing global gdp to decrease.

Therefore, any coronavirus news is relevant because it increases bear argument and we become super sayan.  Just sayin'.

To recap: Singapore and Thailand are ded.

The french chalet cluster is big problem because it doesnt come from.china. so they have to effectively ban anyone coming from europe, if it continues spreading.

One of the latest patient arrived in the UK via Geneva. Worse, the cluster are jet setters.

Bans on planes from Europe, if the virus spreads there over the next month."
