The bear thesis is that the virus will be a pandemic and effect supply chain, thus causing global gdp to decrease.

Therefore, any coronavirus news is relevant because it increases bear argument and we become super sayan.  Just sayin'.

To recap: Singapore and Thailand are ded.

The french chalet cluster is big problem because it doesnt come from.china. so they have to effectively ban anyone coming from europe, if it continues spreading.

One of the latest patient arrived in the UK via Geneva. Worse, the cluster are jet setters.

Bans on planes from Europe, if the virus spreads there over the next month."

Edit: looking into the index component of the hang Seng. Pretty much the only thing that’s green is Hengan International Group. They sell napkins and diapers and it is soaring. Everything else on the exchange is pretty bloody

Edit 2: just dug deeper and turns out in 2018 the Hengan International Group stock plunged after an analyst called it a worthless front. It hit the circuit breaker and paused trading. “The company has orchestrated a scheme using a web of inter-company related transactions to artificially inflate profits and conceal fake cash balances”

Edit 3: Hang Seng might not be doing great because of Chinese injections, it might just be doing great because Hengan International Group are putting in fake transactions. It’s literally the only thing on the exchange that’s consistently been green. Everything else that’s green is only .1% or lower. Hengan has consistently been getting 5% daily profits.

It's illegal to buy it without money you don't have, but that doesn't really matter 'cause, get a load of this, all right; if you get stopped by Robinhood after you get margin called, it's illegal for them to just take the money from you if you have it in another account.*

I think the details of this Iran/US deal will probably be released in order to change headlines from coronavirus soon. These rumors in Iran are spreading fast and the gov no longer talks about Soleimani/IRGC in the media.

It's really interesting, because although the erosion to the structure can be seen long before it fails, there is nothing dramatic at all.. Right up until there is. Once that happens, there's no way to move fast enough to get away from the ensuing tsunami.

It's possible that our dam won't burst this week, or this month... but the erosion to the internal structure of the financial system is clear. This market feels more like a game of musical chairs than a means of allocating value.

REAL DD BELOW

    Alright everyone knows that millennials/zoomers value experiences over products. Nobody thinks you're rich if you have an iPhone. The new face of luxury is traveling to exotic/erotic locations and peppering your instagram with the proof. What is the rarest and most exclusive travel destination? Outer space GUH. Anyone with 250k to burn (approx 1.6 million people in the 1%) is going to splurge on this if SPCE can get up and running. The technology is there. Previous crash was due to human error, not technology failure. This is the future. This stock is what TSLA was 8 years ago, and then some. Until SpaceX goes public, this is the only space travel stock you can buy. Literally no competitors to this ticker. Operating loss of 50mil. All they have to do is send a few hundred people to space and they are turning a profit. This literally can't go tits up. Go short, go long.. it doesn't EFFING matter, this is literally going to space and you're a GUH if you aren't in."
