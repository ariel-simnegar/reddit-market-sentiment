I'm bored and started running names. The person Trevor Milton put in charge of his Hydrogen Development? His brother, Travis, who previous did concrete and home renovations for ten years?

Rap sheet going back almost two decades. Most recently for domestic assault a year and a half ago. I've provided this information to the parties that can propagate it. Including GM. Working on Trevor. Numerous domestics. Numerous assaults. Shoplifting. 

I can't tell you what to do with that information. Mostly because that could be interpreted numerous ways and I like this sub. So, do whatever you want with it - but sharing the screenshots to Trevor resulted in an immediate block.

I'm just some dipshit on the internet, but - non professional and dipshit observation - I'd exit my positions tomorrow since it'll probably be until next week until that party starts.

Maybe I'm wrong. It won't matter.
Please keep that in mind while making any decision you decide to make.

Fair disclosure:
I have neither shares or contracts in Nikola.

/Quick edit:
I can provide proof of this but it's also on the razor edge of what I'd consider doxing. Find a way to chat with me should you want to discuss it."

2020-09-11 02:48:13,ThePeoplesBard,9,"Your wife brushes her hair as you watch silently from the bed. This is when you find her most beautiful: she’s in her nightly routine, humming softly, wearing ancient pajamas she got one Christmas when she was still a girl.

“What are you looking at?” The question startles you. You stare at her like this most nights, and she never notices. But now she smiles at you—or rather her reflection in the mirror does—with an inquisitive eyebrow raised.

“Nothing much,” you try to joke, casually. But she turns around immediately, to look over her shoulder at you: “What’s wrong?” The gravity of her tone briefly catches you off guard, but you collect yourself: “What? Nothing’s wrong.” She stares at your face a bit longer, and then satisfied you aren’t lying—because she trusts you more than any human being she’s ever known—she turns back to her mirror and hair brushing.

And you know why tonight, of all nights, she noticed you watching her: she could sense your fear. She doesn’t know what SPY is. Or a call. But something primal in her knows what you did with those things, and how it is eating you alive inside. Because she loves you. 

Suddenly, you realize fully that you do not deserve the connection that allowed her to sense that in you, the connection that you lied in the face of. As her humming resumes, you start drafting your goodbye."

Cause everyone to scramble and cover shorts. Put to call ratio gets all fucked up and then we enter the last phase of the bull market and fly up to spy 380. Market makers always win. Play both ways at such a crucial point in the market and you’ll make money.

“Enough is enough,” Del Rio continued. “It’s been more than six months. We as an industry, we as  society, have learned a lot on how to live alongside COVID.”

Del Rio said the company’s Healthy Sail Panel in collaboration with Royal Caribbean Group was a week to 10 days away from submitting its plan.

“It will be safe to cruise from America,” he noted.


“We are effecting the 1,000s of employees and their families and their children,” Del Rio continued. “Yet we see airlines flying. I want someone to tell me how it’s possible how COVID-19 transmission doesn’t occur on airplanes when you’re sitting four inches away from someone in a middle seat, yet it happens on a ship that is nearly 200,000 tons. It is unconscionable what’s happened to the cruise industry. We’ve been quiet for too long.”

Del Rio said being more vocal would educate government officials who may not understand the depth of what the industry is going through."

And after months and months of seeing giant dildos undo red, I still sort of can’t believe I was rewarded for holding. Especially after the sharp dildos at 2:50-2:55. Especially with Trump coming on and VXX imploding (I still don’t get that part).

Anyway, at 3:30 I day traded them at a great gain, then said EOD I’d buy calls if we were over 333, or puts if under.

Some things I’ve noticed

- they feel having an assistant is the #1 sign of success and will hire one way before they ca afford to or need to
- they love to automate things way before they have any idea if they need to, or how the process looks or whatever— the idea being they’ll be ready to scale when the time comes. This literally never works
- they typically lack focus and will “pivot” from one strategy to another before they know if the last strategy actually worked or not. The idea being “diversification” so that if one strategy hits you’re good and avoid all eggs in one basket. The result is they’ve got a bunch of half implemented half ass strategies that all don’t work because none were followed through enough.

Fun Fact: Other than March 2020 lows, TSLA has not traded at this low a 2-year forward PEG ratio (0.8x on Street 2-year forward estimates) since May 2019, when TSLA was at $38 (or $190 pre-split). The average PEG ratio at which TSLA has traded over the past 3 yrs is 1.5x. PEG is Price/Earning to Growth ratio. Technically TSLA is extremely undervalued.

Hit a high unrealized gain? Now you’re stuck chasing that back and end up losing... it all. 

So I have a new goal. Scalping options. Hit daily goal and sit out!! 252 trading days a year so small gains add up!!

###500 a day = 126,000
###1K a day = 252,000
###2K a day = 504,000
###3K a day = 756,000

500 a day is a six figure salary the majority wish they could have. 

We’re trying to eat whales all at once when it’s suppose to be ONE BITE AT A TIME. 

Set your daily goal, hit it and walk away. Don’t chase, don’t get greedy. One tendie a day keeps the  🌈🐻 away!

But I'm too much of a degenerate to quit while I'm ahead. I had a couple of days where my account was at 55k, which would have still been nice gains. But no, I'm too much of a retard. 

My IRA which has some long calls and some /r/thetagang strategies is doing less bad. 80k to 144k to 110k now.

Still long on various strikes and dates for AAPL calls, October thru March (mostly in November $125c). I'm counting on run up to earnings as well as product announcements to drive the stock price up, then getting out of my calls before earnings.

New position today for my ira is a fig leaf (https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/leveraged-covered-call/) on AAPL Sept 2022 122.5c. Bought 2 at $23 per. I anticipate Apple will be between $180-$200 per share 2 years from now. Selling monthly $135 calls (changing strike each month to match delta of approximately 0.15).

I also bought Tesla Dec 18 $420 calls

Main moves for tomorrow and the next few weeks... Praying.

Oh also, I'm deployed to a combat zone, and haven't had WiFi for the last 3 days, and fly missions where I'm airborne during market hours, which is what screwed me over in the first place on aapl's first down day. And I was too stupid to set up a trailing stop. I love you retards. I'm just happy I have internet back again so I can lurk and bitch and occasionally claim victory."

It's always possible that we have a big upwards spike (which would be a buyable event imo), but it's just hard to see where it'd come from given dollar strength on lack of US stimulus prospects, which seems to be controlling much of the action right now.  The dollar broke out of its downtrend right when the market fell off a cliff last week, and the movements seem to be tied together at least for now.

They're shoot off buy orders on the big tech stocks to float the prices and make it look like they're going up or holding.

2020-09-10 21:58:02,Leylinus,25,"I know a lot of you are upset about the way the market is shifting but there is a ton of bright side out there. 

I'm not an expert so you might know better, but here are some value stocks you can currently get at multi-month low prices that have a lot of room to grow and absolutely won't go under. This is more for stocks than options btw. 

T- At a three month low, and doesn't move much. Has a high morning star valuation. In addition to their cell network they own Warner Brothers, Cartoon Network, HBO, and a bunch of other stuff including a video games division.

Most importantly, HBO MAX has arguably the best streaming catalog out there. The moment they finalize a deal with ROKU to get on there or Comcast finishes integrating their app it's going to be huge. They have Friends and the Big Bang Theory so they will have the normie audience locked down. 

GE- At a three month low. Will benefit from vaccine production, has a great diversified portfolio, and a likely beneficiary of government contracts. Most importantly it's got a 5 star Morning Star rating. 

CVS- 3 month low, 5 stars from morning star, will benefit in a big way from looming vaccinations. 

BTI- British American Tobacco owns a huge catalog of cigarette and cigar brands, something that remains very popular in much of the world. They've also got a foothold in the ecig industry. 

Most importantly, the UK is taking in millions of rich Hong Kong smokers soon. It also has a 5 star morning star rating. 

DEO- near three month low, has been gaining very nicely lately but dipped a little today. The moment bars open this stock will damn near double and until then you can expect profits to wildly increase from winter drinking. This company owns most of the most well known liquor brands.

Johnny Walker, Captain Morgan, Ketel One, Aviation Gin (Ryan Reynold's thing, dope bottle), Ciros, Smirnoff, J&B, Crown Royal, Don Julio and so on and so forth. One of my favorite stocks. 

AMCX- 5 star morning star rating, currently at the best price you'll ever find. Has the best prestige tv catalog aside from HBO, especially for the streaming market. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Walking Dead (spin offs incoming), Legion, MAD MEN, Killing Eve, Halt and Catch Fire, and a huge collection of other things that will always be streaming on multiple platforms. 

They've also got Shudder, which is probably the best niche streaming service and will do gangbusters next month.

MSFT - If you don't buy MSFT at 205 there is literally no helping you. They're the only option for business. They benefit from students doing class from home since you can't use exam software on chrome books. Teams has become huge. They just got that huge Jedi contract from the government. They're one of the only tech companies that's not on the verge of getting fucked hard by the federal government... and they're absolutely about to get Tik Tok. 

Currently undervalued by about 10% according to Morning Star and that's not factoring in the spread of Teams of the fact that the additional data mining from Tik Tok may finally make Bing a real competitor.

Oh, and of course, the new Xbox. Game pass (streaming service for video games) is also fantastic and will soon become the new industry standard. 

SWBI - As low as you're likely to see it. Gun sales are huge and they'll spike even more once threats of gun grabbing become part of the campaign. Believe me, Republicans always use this in the run up to the end because it rallies moderate conservatives better than anything else. 

Constant riot footage also means constant gun sales, and based on recently released earnings information the concerns about supply problems that have kept the stock from mooning have been put to bed. 

Best of all, while threats of gun bans will stimulate sales, they're also not a threat at all anymore. On the gun issue, the court is solidly 5-4. And it's likely to soon be 6-3 as Ginsberg surviving until January is very unlikely. 

Finally, and most controversially, XOM - Its as low as it could possibly get and the question of its future is entirely about when it kicks back up, not if. Increased travel from the holidays will push it over. Not to mention increased tension in the South China Sea means a lot of carriers and planes wasting a lot of fuel. 

It also has a 5 star Morning Star rating.

*Bonus recommendation- Not blue chip like the others, but DXLG offers more growth at better odds than any other stock you'll find. A well established chain store that sells high end brands (Lacoste, Polo, etc. etc.) in big and tall sizes. If you've been outside recently you know that Covid has made Americans MUCH fatter. They also have a very well developed online store. 

They currently sit at around 1/6 their precovid numbers, and their recent earnings report painted a positive picture. There is also a huge wall of shares preventing it from falling below 25 cents. Their set up will also allow them to benefit from ongoing small business assistance from federal Covid discretionary funds. I've got thousands of shares and I'll be holding until it's back to the nearly two dollars it was at before, though with the additional fatties it could get even better. *

Hope this info helps somebody out there. We're moving into uncertain time, and these stocks are all things you can park your money in and get guaranteed gains beyond any index. 

Remember, a down market is a buying opportunity. Since stocks usually only go up, make sure to pounce when you can!"

Now here is my next prediction... Tesla Battery day will be a bull trap and Apple will drop on Sept 23rd... 5G will be great when you have full coverage but the infrastructure is not built out. Honestly the leap from 3G to 4G was huge as you could stream live video. All 5G does for the average person is allow them to download or steam HighRez content. People already blew their stimulus load on inflatable pools and Jetskis this summer and now that PPP is running out and the markets are not “printing trendies” for every 22 year old “day trader” the MM are going to hit the reset button.  Also banks need to get their shit in order in the next two week and as we all know the last two weeks of March and the last two weeks of Sept is when shit gets real.

2020-09-10 21:14:03,Panda_Pineapple,6,"Alright guys, I hate astrology as much as anyone here, but I think I have some actual DD— plus I’m fucking tired of losing money over the past three days from stupid decisions. 

If you look at the 50 day EMA and 20 day EMA on either the chart of QQQ or SPY (1 year timeframe),  you’ll see that the past three days they’ve been bounce between the two moving averages. Tuesday was the first time either QQQ or SPY dropped below and closed below the 20 day EMA since June, but it only lasted for three days then. Prior to that, they hadn’t dropped below it since the beginning of March. Daily volume and volatility are still high, and cyclicals aren’t performing; the market can break out either way at this point. 

I think it’s best to wait to make any real plays until we break and close out of the channel between the 50 day EMA and 20 day EMA... right now I’m just trying to day trade before I get into leaps/long positions. Holding VXX shares/calls might be a good move as well."

## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Thursday in a broad-based retreat led by shares of technology and energy companies. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5%, and the Russell 2000 declined 1.2%. 
* The day started with the S&P 500 up 0.8%, and briefly surpassing yesterday's intraday high, on the back of leadership from the mega-caps and growth stocks. The latter might have benefited from an underwhelming weekly initial jobless claims report, which was unchanged at 884,000 (consensus 813,000).
* On no specific news, though, these stocks quickly turned around and the selling carried over to the broad market throughout the day. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in red, and 29 of the 30 Dow components finished lower.
* The information technology (-2.3%) and energy (-3.7%) sectors declined more than the S&P 500, while the materials sector (-0.9%) was a relative outperformer. At one point today, the influential tech sector was up 2.6%. 
* Some factors that might have pressured sentiment included the inability to sustain yesterday's rebound, suggesting that there was still more selling ahead, and news that the Senate failed to pass its $300 billion coronavirus relief bill. Granted, no one was expecting that bill to get very far, but it reflected the burgeoning pessimism surrounding another relief bill.
* As equities steepened losses throughout the afternoon, money flowed into longer-dated U.S. Treasuries in a safety trade. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.14%, while the 10-yr yield decreased two basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 93.41. WTI crude futures fell 2.1%, or $0.78, to $37.27/bbl.
* Bucking the trend today was RH (RH 385.46, +64.38, +20.1%) after the furniture and home accessories company exceeded quarterly expectations. RH shares surged 20% to fresh record highs. 
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for August and the Treasury Budget for August on Friday.

Oil industry will suffer a lot in Q3 compared to any other industries. Oil bankruptcies over 2020 is tracked by law firm Haynes and Boone, LLP, for the US.

Here's the latest report: [https://www.haynesboone.com/-/media/files/energy\_bankruptcy\_reports/oil\_patch\_bankruptcy\_monitor.ashx?la=en&hash=D2114D98614039A2D2D5A43A61146B13387AA3AE](https://www.haynesboone.com/-/media/files/energy_bankruptcy_reports/oil_patch_bankruptcy_monitor.ashx?la=en&hash=D2114D98614039A2D2D5A43A61146B13387AA3AE)

Bankruptcies are growing in Q3 more than ever. (partly due to recovery stalling and drop in oil prices), more than 250 filings.

TLDR: short oil to 30$ and short banks due to the banks will be forced to increase loan loss reserves as the threat of more bankruptcies among debt-strapped U.S. oil producers increases."

Yeah I get that a 10 dollar drop and rebound can make for separate returns, but really only if you are investing a large amount of money each day and then playing hourly trends. I heard a guy say he planned on making 3k before the 10 dollar dip. So what were his expectations on quantity of shares to move today?

I’m new here, but not necessarily new to investing. Are y’all really ripping and retrieving 20+k a day?"
