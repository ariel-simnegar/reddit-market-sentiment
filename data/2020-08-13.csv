We mooned on a pump and prayer from Mnuchin end of July and it turned out to be crap. The stimulus we 'mooned' on was not just about the UI benefits.

I see a lot of posts blasting bears with the reasoning that they are betting against America or something on that line

But there is another explanation why some of us expect or wish for the market to tank

It comes down to empathy 

Some people actually empathize with all the human misery that's going on out there and our moral stance makes it very difficult to accept that a lot of people can make a lot of money by taking advantage of these dire circumstances where literally half the country is struggling

So it's not like bears wish utter destruction or rooting for others to fail

Bears simply are crying inside when they see how much suffering is going on out there and they wish that maybe the more fortunate can for once in their lives resist that greed and actually try to be a decent human being and help others who are less fortunate

Show some god damn sympathy for others and stop constantly obsessing about the fucking stonk market

The stonk market would not exist without people

And people are now struggling badly

If you're one of the 10%-ers who own most of the stonks maybe you could donate 10% of your obscene gains in the last 5 months to help someone who is waiting in line at a food bank"

August 12, 2020 01:37 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Government

An Eastman Kodak Co. (NYSE:KODK) board member and his wife donated nearly half their stock holding in the company, amounting to 3 million shares, to a religious charity on a day when the company‚Äôs stock hit its highest valuation since 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. 

What Happened

George Karfunkel and his wife Renee Karfunkel made the donation to New York-based Congregation Chemdas Yisroel on July 29, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The donation, thought to be the largest made to a religious organization based on a list maintained by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, is valued at about $116.3 million, based on the Kodak stock's average trading price of $38.75 per share on that day, with an intraday low of $17.5 and high of $60.


The New York charity‚Äôs registration filings indicate that the benefactor Kodak board member Karfunkel is also its president, as per the Journal. 

The donation has the potential to give the couple a tax break in the region of tens of millions of dollars."

I‚Äôve now split 50% of my portfolio into Apple stock  30% in Apple (Nov480 March50 June 500) and 20% Tesla Nov2000. Should I roll my Tesla into 2021? My goal is to get to $800k before I convert everything into stock and sell weeklies which I‚Äòm betting may happen in a few wks (running into the stock splits). Does this trade make sense? Should I just F it and covert the remaining 50% of options into Apple and Tesla stock??

As European Markets open shortly, investors are still nervous for how to end the week, as we are still crawling against major resistances to ATHs. Interestingly, metals did recover some of their big losses from Wednesday, but show less dynamic than before. Could that signale more investor confidence based on the russian vaccine announcement or stimulus? Investors certainly seem to brush off the lacking progress towards a US stimulus deal, as the talks pretty much failed at this point. 

Without many good news left for August, what I recommend today would be buying calls, puts or stocks. Have a nice trading day."

Modern democrats cater to those poor poor people and ""help"" relieve some of their poorness with welfare/food stamps/subsidized housing etc etc. Rural poor folk don't consider themselves to be in need of ""help"" and are more on the side of fuck off with your help the less of you the better.

TL;DR: Apple doesn't just take a 30% of every app sale. They take a 30% cut of *all revenue* from *all in app purchases*.

This makes it virtually impossible to compete against Apple (and Google) in any particular app space they decide to go into. And you can bet that if your app becomes popular they're going to clone it and try to crush you out of business and steal your customers.

3. Dress up as bear getting fucked (or pegged) by bull. Obviously this will require a volunteer, but will pay out the most. Bears love throwing their money away more than anyone else and bulls will get a good laugh.

4. Yolo part of profits into stupid plays to make more videos.

I'll tell y'all a cheat code to living a good life and being happy. 

Exercise and eat good food.

Get in the gym, get swole. It takes 2 weeks of dedication for you to notice a difference and 3 weeks for other people. I know a lot of you are either skinny, fat, or skinny-fat. If you're skinny, there's a supplement called serious mass that contains 1400 calories per 2 scoops. Take that alongside a workout minimum 3 times a week and you'll gain 10 pounds of muscle. If you're fat, lift alongside rigorous cardio; push yourself to your limit. If you're fat, all you need to eliminate from your diet is junk food and sodas. As long as you exercise, you'll get fit. If you're skinny fat, you were probably once skinny but years of sitting down and being inactive has caught up with you. You just got to get out there and put in work in the gym. 

You guys do this you'll wake up with confidence you've never had before. You'll be ready to tear the world apart. Success all starts with getting your body and mind right. If you don't have that together, no amount of baggers will ease your pain."

Foxconn counts Apple as one of its major customers and assembles the bulk of iPhones for the U.S. tech giant.

There are concerns that U.S.-China tensions could hurt the revenue of Foxconn, after President Donald Trump issued executive orders banning American transactions with Chinese tech firms Tencent and ByteDance.

no one realizes how big this will probably be. ""oh no, apple blocked an app from the store, no one gives a fuck"". these small things slowly spiral out of control.

no, this is literally america vs china. apple is literally the symbol of AMERICA. fortnite is 40% owned by tencent. its safe to say the ceo cuck probably has less control of epic games than tencent even though he has a 50% control in the company. tencent is literally using fortnite as propaganda to paint apple as a piece of shit. it may seem like ""banter"" for little kids, but this is exactly what propaganda looks like. this isn't apple vs fOrNiTe, it's tencent (china basically), attacking the most american company possibly by calling it the equivalent of ""1984"" (the irony).

One thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of QQQ, based on every technical factor out there, we are looking at a grand slam home run."

**Context -**

The S&P 500 declined 0.2 however, the continued strength in the mega-cap stocks helped limit the decline. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%.

**Apple** (**AAPL** 460.04, +8.00, +1.8%) set a fresh record high in a momentum trade, helping the information technology sector (+0.04%) squeeze out a gain despite a pullback in the semiconductor stocks. There was an 11% decline in **Cisco** (**CSCO** 42.72, -5.38, -11.2%) following poor guidance. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.1%.¬†

Nine sectors closed lower led by energy (-2.0%), real estate (-1.2%), industrials (-0.7%), and financials (-0.6%) sectors declining the most.¬†

Initial claims decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (consensus 1.150 mln), which was the first time since March that claims checked in below one million. This was positive, but some questioned whether it would lessen the pressure for lawmakers to reach a timely coronavirus relief bill.

A report from *Politico* suggested that there is little hope among negotiators of reaching a deal by September. House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) said she will only resume talks with White House officials if they are willing to agree to at least a $2 trillion deal.¬†

Interestingly, the S&P 500 scraped above its all-time closing high (3386.15) and matched its high from yesterday at around the 3387 level before facing selling pressure throughout the afternoon.

Turns out it is for ads across all of streaming TV. [oneview](https://www.adweek.com/digital/rokus-new-ad-platform-oneview-signals-growth-ambitions-across-all-of-ott/)Probably explains part of the 40% rev growth yoy. I am pretty sure the company could be profitable if they wanted to be. The loss each year seems to be around the same amount even with massive revenue growth. So they get revenue from having their own TTD along with being a platform for streaming. Should be massive profits one day

The name of the company, Powershares QQQ. It is a cutting edge high-tech ETF out of Silicon Valley awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of üåàüêª detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications now. Right now, the stock trades over-the-counter at $273.30 a share. And by the way, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment would be upwards of $60,000! 

One thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of QQQ, based on every technical factor out there, we are looking at a grand slam home run."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had kept the chamber in session this week, which was technically the first in its August recess, as a last-ditch attempt to create space for the administration and congressional Democrats to get an agreement.
But with talks stalemated, senators argue there is little reason for them to keep holding daily, roughly 1 1/2-hour sessions. The House already left town and isn't expected to return until Sept. 14."

2020-08-13 20:16:04,Revolant742,2,"~~Fall 2008~~

Fall 2020

Even before the opening bell, ~~Monday~~ Friday looked ugly.
But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.

Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid ravaged economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined ~~Monday~~ Friday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ~~announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of a bailout~~ made little ground on a Covid Stimulus deal, but no one believed it would take this long. Flirting with all time highs the market began unraveling Thursday afternoon..
