S&P bumps to 3200 where it stays until mid July and the Senate finally finalized the HEALS Act. Again, with assurances from Mnuchin a deal would be reached shortly with the House/Senate minority (pump, pump, pump...)

We mooned on a pump and prayer from Mnuchin end of July and it turned out to be crap. The stimulus we 'mooned' on was not just about the UI benefits.
