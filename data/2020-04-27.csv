2020-04-28 11:49:05,dbgtboi,28,"Daily explanation of why markets are mooning:

Once again, stop using earnings/guidance/pe/whatever other bullshit you are using to value stocks. Since 2008, the fed has taken control of the market, the only thing you should ever be looking at is the fed. When QE begins, stonks go up, when QE stops, stonks go down. This simple strategy would have predicted every goddamn movement for you in the last 12 years and made you a multimillionaire. Nothing has changed in 2020, market is still controlled by the fed, we have the biggest QE program we have ever had, so stonks go up. Do not bet against this shit until the fed turns off QE or you are basically flushing money down the toilet. Infinite QE will most likely not be turned off anytime soon because we cannot go back to fundamentals right now (that would be a 50% crash easily) so it will be here to stay for at least another few months. Yes, btw, we can easily go past ATH with this level of printing, like I said, ignore the goddamn economy, it isn't even remotely related to the stock market at this point."

# Junk Bonds Bounce Back, Raising Hopes—and Concerns

Paywall warning.  So, I will post it here:

>A rally in corporate debt is enabling riskier companies to raise much-needed cash while fueling debate over whether investors have grown overly optimistic about the economy.  
>  
>From April 13 through Friday, companies such as Ford Motor Co., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. issued a combined $28 billion of speculative-grade bonds, the fourth-largest two-week total on record, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.  
>  
>The surge in issuance follows an even bigger boom in new sales of investment-grade bonds, as businesses of all stripes try to stock up on funds to weather a period in which many can expect little to no incoming cash flow. Bond sales have continued despite volatility in oil prices, with investors largely separating the problems of energy companies from those in other sectors.  
>  
>Speculative-grade companies -- which tend to have large debt loads, challenged business operations or both -- had gone most of March without issuing new debt, after investors dumped their bonds and potential borrowing costs skyrocketed.  
>  
>On Feb. 18, the average extra yield, or spread, investors demanded to hold speculative-grade bonds over U.S. Treasurys was just 3.41 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. By March 23, it had climbed to 11.0 percentage points. But Friday, it was back down to 7.75 percentage points -- still relatively high, but low enough that large numbers of companies can borrow in the market, especially if they back their bonds with collateral.  
>  
>Along with other assets like stocks, high-yield bonds have been boosted by government and central bank policies. Those include the Federal Reserve's promise to buy investment-grade corporate bonds and even some lower-rated bonds, provided they were only recently downgraded.  
>  
>Investors' analysis of history has also helped. Over the past three decades, high-yield bond investors have been able to generate some of their best returns in the months after large selloffs pushed spreads to about 9 percentage points.  
>  
>The lesson from that is ""you don't get this opportunity every year, and when you do you've got to jump on it,"" said Scott Roberts, head of high yield at Invesco Fixed Income.  
>  
>Improved demand for speculative-grade bonds has already helped some companies.  
>  
>Prices for Ford bonds collapsed last month when the company shut down car production. On March 24, the company's 7.45% unsecured bonds due in 2031 traded as low as 62.25 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess, translating to a yield above 14%. S&P Global Ratings downgraded the company's credit rating to below investment grade the next day.  
>  
>Already wrestling with slowing sales before the pandemic, Ford has estimated it could burn through around $5 billion a month before it gradually restarts production in the second quarter.  
>  
>The bonds, though, jumped to nearly 90 cents on April 9, when the Fed said it would buy recently downgraded bonds. A week later, Ford issued $8 billion of unsecured bonds, the largest speculative-grade bond sale on record, according to LCD. Its new 10-year bonds came with an interest rate below 10%.  
>  
>The recent rally in high-yield bonds is part of a broader trend that has lifted the S&P 500 by about 29% since its March lows. As with stocks, however, investors are questioning the durability of the move.  
>  
>One cause for concern is an unusually large disconnect between what the market is implying about how many companies will default over the next nine to 12 months and what analysts at ratings firms and Wall Street banks are predicting.  
>  
>According to one model developed by Marty Fridson, the chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC and a longtime high-yield bond analyst, the market is currently pricing in a twelve-month default rate of 8.1%. A different model produced by research firm CreditSights puts the market-implied default rate at 7.4% over the next nine months.  
>  
>By contrast, Moody's Investors Service has forecast a trailing twelve-month default rate of 11.8% by the end of the year and 13.1% by the end of next March. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have similarly forecast a twelve-month default rate of 13% by the end of this year.  
>  
>With social and business activity severely restricted across the country, there is little debate about the near-term hit to the U.S. economy. Investors, though, have tended toward optimism about how quickly the economy can recover, with markets consistently rallying on signs that the spread of the virus is slowing or that potential drug treatments are working.  
>  
>Many economists -- and, for that matter, epidemiologists -- have been more pessimistic. In their view, the threat from the virus could linger into next year, continuing to depress economic activity and causing bankruptcies and job losses that will further drag on growth.  
>  
>""My sense is the market is attaching a higher probability to a V-shaped recovery than I would or most economists would at this point,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which produced the economic forecasts underlying the default forecast of its sister ratings firm.  
>  
>One wild card could be the market's ability to help create its own reality. The stronger the high-yield market is, the more likely it is that struggling companies such as movie-theater operator AMC will be able to obtain rescue financing, holding down the default rate at least over the near-term horizon.  
>  
>Still, extending loans to businesses that might otherwise run out of cash isn't without risk, since adding debt to companies could lead to deeper losses for bondholders if those businesses ultimately file for bankruptcy anyway.  
>  
>""We don't know if we are prolonging the inevitable and impairing recoveries at a junior level, or whether we're providing the Band-Aid to actually get the company through to sustainability,"" said Geof Marshall, head of fixed income at Signature Global Asset Management, a division of CI Investments."

He just calculated yesterday if he had been laid off with the rest of his team for corona he would be making unemployment + $600 a week federally. Nearly $2k a paycheck and could've kept that going for 10 months. I didn't even have anything to say back to him.

I work at and with early-stage tech companies, so I have a decent window into the mobile advertising landscape. (not claiming to be an expert) Snap has been able to keep relatively large advertisers Uber Eats, Postmates, Mint, Quibi, etc on the platform and for smaller advertisers they were always the cheapest options so SMBs have shifted focus over to Snap. For FB their main source of rev, the Facebook platform not IG, is focused on SMB or individual advertising that is relatively expensive but has much more detailed analytics than SNAP.

2020-04-28 07:16:28,jf286381,12,"Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a **liquidity trap**. There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period. Or we'll try and print our way to inflation -- with consumer spending as the operative variable.

Welcome to the debt bubble! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* Wage increase (through Federal stimulus check or other) will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble.

Cash out high. Assets will be worth less than cash. Then pay down your debt or invest when we finally touch bottom. The environment looks exceptionally bearish for months and years to come. Everyone is scared to say liquidity trap because that will cause equities and lending to tank. But I encourage you to scream it."

Now everyone is worried that there is going to be a drop in consumer demand. However, the supply chain issue still exists. I've been bored out of my fucken mind the past two months and have been trying to buy an Oculus for two months now, but they've been out of stock for two whole fucken months. There's definitely still supply chain issues happening globally. Even Apple said they're only going to be producing the shitty $399 iPhones in 2020, and delaying the new flagship ones till 2021. That's probably subtly hinting that they're having supply chain issues or something."

""We're going to probably need another phase of stimulus of some sort. We've built a bridge to the other side of this crisis we believe and it looks like we're getting close to opening up in many places around the country. With that, we have to think about what's it going to take to make sure we go back to thriving,"" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a Fox News Channel interview.

""And I don't think that absent another round of stimulus that it's very likely that you would see a V-shape,"" he added."

New York Attorney General Letitia James told Amazon in an April 22 letter that the state is looking into whether the company violated federal employment law or ran afoul of state whistle-blower protections by dismissing the worker, Chris Smalls, her spokesperson confirmed on Monday."

2020-04-28 03:04:06,DrHarrisonLawrence,7,"Here’s what’s happening: People pulled profits early on $FAGMAN before earnings. They don’t care if the earnings are good, they already milked 20% profits the last three weeks. So they’re putting their gains into the rest of the S&P490, and now you saw some banks and other weirdos get green today.

Those who sold tech to pull profits early before earnings aren’t rebuying again before earnings. And also, those who didn’t sell tech to pull profits before earnings are probably about to do so tomorrow, because they were late compared to the real rich people who sold into volume last Friday. So it should be another flat or red day for tech tomorrow (besides Slack, they’re good for a run past $30.49 at this point). I can see people rebuying into tech on Friday depending on how the earnings play out.

If all is well, we will go down 12% this week. Friday could be a 2.4% greener cleaner so then maybe overall we’re down 9.8% since this morning.

Honestly that would be really cool and fair"

My former coworker who got me into options trading, told me he is putting his whole portfolio into oil.  Now when this dude was talking to me about oil all the years we worked together, I’d be secretely thinking in the back of my head what the fuck does this proletariat know about oil trading that makes him so special.  Might as well have been picking letters out of Alphabet soup.  

So we had been exchanging textes and this Sob convinced me to fomo into oil calls because damn, “how could it get any lower, if it goes back to what it was 2 days ago it will moon!”  I don’t usually put my money into things I know nothing about, because the losses feel so much worse, but fuck it I put on my Tarbush, white robe, and bought all the contracts like I just set foot on the Gulf of Iraq.  USO, UCO, my hands were like that of Thanos in his golden gauntlet, waiving my arms as if time stood still, buying all the contracts faster than TDameritrade could fill the orders.  Then at the snap of the fingers, just as the gauntlet predicted, my portfolio split in half.  The second snap, it was gone.  

My only hope is that I wake up from this terrible dream, or that it never happened at all.  Better to go out with an exclamation point, then a question of what could have been, I suppose."

Volume has shot through the roof since the middle of March, but buying volume for USO down below the $3-4 range has started improving. Granted, it still has some ways to go before it approaches more healthy long-term levels, but it's certainly looking like the short-term bottom is in.

#I'm anticipating a return back to the $4 area here over the next month or so as governments continue pushing to open up the economy and create some more demand for crude products.

- sell a call with $300 strike let's say a week out 

- keep the premium 

- if spy drops then the call expires and you keep your tendies and do it again 

- if spy goes up over 300 and someone exercises the option then you're forced to sell at $300/share... and still keep the premium (just miss out on future gains if spy keeps going up)

Am I missing something here?

Edit - if spy drops a lot and have no intention of ever selling unless someone exercises a call, then that's a moot point  big brain bros."

2020-04-28 01:25:13,saliym1988,4,"We’re reaching out about important changes to your USO options contracts.

United States Oil Fund LP (USO) will perform a 1 for 8 (1:8) reverse split at the start of the trading day on April 29th, 2020. Due to the reverse split, your contracts will become USO1 options contracts, and the deliverables will change to cash-in-lieu (CIL) of USO stocks. Cash-in-lieu will be determined by the OCC when pricing for USO1 is finalized.

What to expect:
If you sold a contract: We will send a follow-up email once the amount of cash-in-lieu has been determined by the OCC.
If you exercise a call contract: You’ll still pay 100 times the strike price. In return, you’ll receive 12 shares of USO and the cash value equivalent of 0.5 fractional shares.
If you exercise a put contract: You’ll still receive 100 times the strike price. You’ll need to deliver 12 shares of USO and the cash value equivalent of 0.5 fractional shares.

Once the OCC determines the final amount of cash-in-lieu, it will take two trading days for the cash to settle in your Robinhood account, if applicable.

How to know if you’re in or out of the money:
Until the cash-in-lieu amount is determined by the OCC, the underlying price for USO1 will be equal to 0.125 USO. You can multiply the price of USO by 0.125 to determine whether your contract is in or out of the money.

For example, if you own a $2.50 call contract, you’ll want the price of USO multiplied by 0.125 to be greater than $2.50:
If USO is trading at or over $20, your contract will be at or in the money. ($20*0.125=$2.50, which is equal to $2.50)
If USO is trading below $20, your contract will be out of the money. ($10*0.125=$1.25, which is less than $2.50)"

I have a banking and PE background and have been teaching myself options with around 75k and am down a little over 10k mostly from dumb mistakes and capitulating too early. Tomorrow: 1) thinking of buying 30-50 Bill.com 60 5/15C and holding until the day before their earnings date: 5/7.  It’s  a solid leader in the AP/AR automation space. 2) Also considering CRWD 80 5/15C. 3) Longer dated call options on a basket of casinos, hotels and restaurants. Not looking to put a ton of capital at risk or big time YoLo, I’d be happy with a 1.5-2X on what I play with this year. Appreciate any good or terrible ideas. Thanks guys!"

2020-04-27 23:48:12,KimJongUnsTrousers,6,Public companies refusing to return the PPP money meant for small business is so evil. You're public - you have access to public markets and can sell shares while it's the only access to capital for Mom and Pop and now you've squeezed them out. Most of these public companies have rallied with the rest of the market and are well off March lows. How does a company like Monty Bennett apply for over $100M and get $68M.

- 25,000 PCR tests a day (the standard test)
- Antibody (serology) - started with their own employees, currently have done 1,000 tests. Highly accurate test (95-100% accurate, wow!), nothing like what you are hearing in the press. Less quality tests will tests for all coronaviruses, Bioreference test will be more specific. 
- Infrastructure is in place for drawing blood for these tests and the analyzers are much faster. 
- 100,000 - 200,000 A DAY by second week of May
- 30,000 in a week then a significant scale up , WILL BE NATIONALLY DONE
- IT systems need to be brought up to handle the new users coming online to check their results

""I can't say, but I wish him well"" 

The ""I Can't say"" makes me think, oh shit he's dead but ""I wish him well"" predisposes the idea that he's alive.

put them together and I'm willing to bet he's still in critical condition. It doesn't seem like it would be a secret if it was just bad reporting, and I doubt Trump would pass on the opportunity to shit on the media for that since CNN broke it. 

Then as I was typing this, Trump essentially said there was no chance that Kim would have made a statement on Saturday.

I think it's as clear to confirmation as we can get: Kim is alive, probably in critical condition making a statement from Kim so laughably impossible that Trump responded that way."

But only a very cheap / older Iphone. Almost as a test or sampling how iphones work. Can anyone suggest what Iphone I should get? I keep hearing mostly iphone 5 or 6,6s or even possibly the 7?

My only requirements are that it must be in the $50 to $90 range (I would be buying it from amazon, or craigslist or something used for sure.) Also I want it to have solid battery life (which I love about iphones) and needs to be able to handle apps well. Thinks like facebook live, or cam streaming sites, skype type of apps.

My own company has frozen hiring and frozen annual raises, and is on the cusp of beginning RIFs. Big-name consulting firms aren't selling any business. Oil is at unprecedented levels and it doesn't look like the demand will bounce back any time soon. Go outside and aside from the main roads and major grocery stores, every plaza/mall/commercial strip is deserted. We haven't even seen the ramnifications on the housing and the mortgage market. This could certainly eventually turn into a financial crises as much as it is a health crises. People will default when 4 months of payment is due upfront. 20M people are literally living off unemployment. We won't be able to safely pack movie theaters, stadiums, concerts for a long time.  We don't even know if the virus won't come back as we open up states. There could easily be a second wave.  There's no plausible evidence that the antibody theory is real.

>In the worldwide race for a vaccine to stop the coronavirus, the laboratory sprinting fastest is at Oxford University.

>Most other teams have had to start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. But scientists at the university’s Jenner Institute had a head start on a vaccine, having proved in previous trials that similar inoculations — including one last year against an earlier coronavirus — were harmless to humans.

>That has enabled them to leap ahead and schedule tests of their new coronavirus vaccine involving more than 6,000 people by the end of next month, hoping to show not only that it is safe, but also that it works.

>The Oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by September — at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts — if it proves to be effective.

>  
>**As part of its Municipal Lending Facility, the Fed is buying up to $500 billion worth of state and local government bonds. In an announcement Monday, the central bank said the facility now will buy debt from counties and states with populations of at least 500,000 and cities with 250,000 residents or more.**  
>  
>In addition, the Fed expanded the duration of the bonds it will buy from two years under the previous announcement to three years. The program is limited to investment-grade debt.  
>  
>The Fed also said it will consider in the future buying revenue bonds. Officials “will continue to closely monitor conditions” in local and state government debt markets” as it determines whether to accept the revenue bonds, the announcement added.

>\- Contributions to employee pension funds aren't enough to cover future guaranteed payouts to retirees. Cities have three poor choices. They must either raise taxes, reduce spending on other services, or cut benefits.   
>  
>\- The largest expenditure for state budgets is Medicaid. These health costs are rising, which could cut into state revenue-sharing with cities.    
>  
>\- Cities and states are issuing bonds to cover current operating costs.  
>  
>\- They are selling off assets to pay operating expenses.

Much of the economy is on life support as fear of a pandemic keeps Americans at home. Global trade and investment are collapsing. The economy is looking at the possibility of a long-lasting depression. So why is the stock market doing so well?

Two possible reasons:

1- Stock market investors simply expect the full economic recovery after the end of lockdown. But that is looking increasing unlikely. (think about unemployment numbers and bankruptcies so far)

2- This is more disturbing that investors have decided that the US government will prioritise preserving stock market valuations regardless of what happens to the rest of economy. This possibility makes stock markets almost a useless place to evaluate economy and companies."

2020-04-27 20:12:11,HyerStandards,2,"TSLA is one of the few stocks I follow down to a research level.  I'm bullish, but ive seen and attended several earnings calls and in my experience if it runs up like this prior to earnings it almost always takes a 5-10% haircut on the day of.  Even if the numbers come out good.  The only thing that might be different this time is if they post 140M profit or whatever the profit cap is for S&P500 inclusion and guide to sustained profit minus a covid hiccup. Extra bullish of they plow through covid with positive profit."

This nonsense is not on Dr Powell's list.

The Ponzi Inc will save OIL. So, they must kill EV.

Stay away from EV like plague. 

Tesla likely to tank to even $250... Nothing can survive Dr Powell's will.

Apologies for the misconception.

Good luck."

No way Trump gives a blue state free money for more. Jobs aren’t returning anytime soon so they’ll probably draw that down by end of May or early June.
