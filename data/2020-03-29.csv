>This isn't /r/politics, /r/the_donald, /r/political_humor, etc. If you choose to start arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

>Nobody cares about your political opinions. If it's not about taking advantage of the political to make money then leave that baggage at home. WSB is not the stage for your lazy political regurgitation nor will it be used as a propaganda mouthpiece by anybody.

No one cares about your takes regarding the morality of the stimulus package or your opinion on the president. Tell me how to make money off of it or post it somewhere else. This is a community for trading, not for political discussion. In addition to reporting, please feel free to tag me directly in any political post or comment and I will take care of it."
