>This isn't /r/politics, /r/the_donald, /r/political_humor, etc. If you choose to start arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

>Nobody cares about your political opinions. If it's not about taking advantage of the political to make money then leave that baggage at home. WSB is not the stage for your lazy political regurgitation nor will it be used as a propaganda mouthpiece by anybody.

No one cares about your takes regarding the morality of the stimulus package or your opinion on the president. Tell me how to make money off of it or post it somewhere else. This is a community for trading, not for political discussion. In addition to reporting, please feel free to tag me directly in any political post or comment and I will take care of it."

It might happen sometimes this week. As soon as they limit supplies oil will surge higher and stock market to follow respectively.

HCQ and Zpack showed success in 80 person trial. All recovered within 6 days which is significantly better than control besides one in ICU and one dead 86 year old who already had a late stage of the illness. Considering the small amount of people over 80 in the population this data, while small, implies a very small mortality rate.

HCQ and Zpack showed success in 80 person trial. All recovered within 6 days which is significantly better than control besides one in ICU and one dead 86 year old who already had a late stage of the illness. Considering the small amount of people over 80 in the population this data, while small, implies a very small mortality rate.

Today, in specific, is a sad day, as I must inform you I have contracted üßªüôå.  I will be selling my puts at open for a loss to be cash gang until the next leg down, at which point I will be going calls to the wall on all the blue and purple chips. 

We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, looming ahead potentially the worst financial crisis in American history, and the Fed is responding with decisive action and great force.

It is my belief that we may be in a completely corrupted system, that will synthetically keep the stock prices up until all the new bears transition into bulls again. 

At that point, when everyone believes the recession is over and have switched back to calls -- rug pull, drill team six, new bottoms, and everyone will be left holding the bag. At this point, fellow autists, it will be time to strike.

Don't be fooled.

They got the gubment involved to make it all legal. This was so they could pay for decades while being slaves to the bankers and businessmen, with the promise of having financial freedom one day. So mainstreet funneled their hard earned pittance into taxes for regulators for their money, they funneled a small portion into their freedon, and they spent what was left buying useless consumer goods from big businesses. This went on for decades, and was beneficial in most peoples eyes for everyone, and when everyone agrees, its a deal. Whether that deal is one sided or not is irrelevant, a deal is a deal. So mainstreet was paying all its money to the bankers, the government, wall street, corporations, and taking on debt to buy more things they couldn't afford, on things they didnt need, to impress ppl they didnt care about. Then one day a man 1000's of miles away eats what is basically an armadillo, and this fairytale all comes crashing down and gets exposed for what it was. Now what happens is yet to be written."

That looks not promising for my poots and I am locking in small gains across my shorts. The ones that are red I probably ride out with stops at 20% loss.

Overall after hearing trump saying 100-200k potential deaths and lockup period extended and seeing futures ripping higher is not a bearish thesis nor a sign. Plus a fucking rebalancing. I am not saying we might gap down after, but so far I have no skin to ride my heavy shorts to almost nil. I would rather cash out now and wait for another short opportunity at higher price levels.

We aren't doing enough to mitigate the worst case scenario. Hospitals in our greatest cities are being overrun and the virus hasn't made it's way through our poorer rural communities. We haven't locked down. People are ignoring social distancing guidelines. Even after all this our mortality rates are going up.

Even China is having a second wave of infections right now. We are probably going to peak in May not April."

2020-03-29 23:48:29,Zaryeah,7,"Futures will be +1% green by open then plummet shortly after, or +1% red by open, surge green, then proceed to plummet.

I expect SPY to be at or below $247 by EOD Monday. We failed to break the $260 resistance Thursday and Friday, and the EOD drill broke through 2 big supports ($257 and $255)

There will be green days but not as face ripping since we won‚Äôt be drilling as hard as we were 1-3 weeks ago. (Less volume. Early COVID-19 scare and Stimulus Bill priced in now) 

All green and red days will be relative to the price action of the day before, so watch those supports and resistances to time your options better. 

Example: if Monday we hit 1 or 2 circuit breakers, wait till Tuesday to buy puts because it will be green until EOD. It will be a spikey staircase on the way down to SPY $180 by mid or late April. 

I don‚Äôt expect any major market altering news from here on out and right now we are in the process of pricing in the next phase of coronavirus. DO NOT fall for the inevitable bull traps. If you know the resistances, wait until those are broken through to worry. 

This is my opinion, not investment advice. Do your own DD pls

2020-03-29 21:18:56,johntaylor37,8,"Open positions and the thinking behind them:
Options:
$3k entry, SPY 1x 280p 5/15 @$31.33
Pretty self explanatory. I think we go down in the near term but I‚Äôm not sure if volatility will stay high or not. Deep ITM reduces the IV risk component as well as the return. I didn‚Äôt want to be right about the direction and still lose money. 
Considering rerolling into IWM puts but I‚Äôll have to read up a bit first and see how far it‚Äôs already fallen.

$5k entry, USO 25x$6c, 2022 expiry, @$1.98
I expect oil to bleed until the SA/Russia argument resolves and then on some random day to moon with a big supply cut announcement that will enable a profitable exit. Clearly I entered too early (the first big drop), but my trade thesis remains unchanged. No idea how long it takes but with a high probability of a global recession there‚Äôs pressure on both countries to make a deal and restore their oil profits. To break even I need USO to hit $8 between now and jan2022, and if it resolves with another cartel setup I‚Äôll expect a profit of 100% or better. Holding because while it will likely still continue to bleed for now, I think odds are better that it will eventually hit than expire worthless and I don‚Äôt think I can time when it hits. 

Shares:
$43k entry, EXIV, 6000 shares @$7.15
European market XIV, full strength unlike SVXY. Volume sucks. Tracks VSTOXX inverted. The European market is a little farther along than ours so while we could see a higher peak value (and this stock goes below my cost basis), I got in with volatility above the 2008 peak. Typically this settles above $30 in a healthy market. I may scalp but I plan to hold to that level before moving back to traditional long term investment stocks."
