Stocks will likely hit [new records](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/stocks-go-for-all-time-highs-next-week-as-the-earnings-season-continues.html) if earnings continue to beat. Well no shit Nostradamus. How about we wait to see what the earnings are before putting up the celebration photos? Reeks of desperate pumping.

Then we've got Shiller saying 50% chance of recession in 18 months. But he's [bullish](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/20/shiller-recession-likely-years-away-due-to-bullish-trump-effect.html) enough to ignore his own PE ratio that he invented, because he thinks Trump has a good chance of being reelected. Again we have some stupid pumping that's not at all based in reality.

There are three events which I believe the market has already prematurely priced in GOOD outcomes for them.

1. the impeachment inquiry isn't over until it's over.
2. The Brexit delay isn't actually delayed until EU officially grants it, they haven't yet and they might not. Johnson still fighting for October 31st.
3. The phase 1 China deal is literally nothing until it's signed on paper, as we've learned from previous trade talks that looked really promising and then fell apart spectacularly at the very next set of talks.

We absolutely could blast through the ATH this week, but I think the risk/reward is better right now with puts."

Us in Canada finally have Wealthsimple which is like CAD RH.. but they don't offer options yet.. Should i simply avoid diversification and allocate a higher percentage of portfolio holdings to option plays where the commission spent is only 2-5% of total potential payout? Or even buying a few AMZN shares to increase trade value to the point where commission is a very small percentage of total payout?

I am proud to say 

I have lost 25 pounds in the last 3 months.

How I did it? 


Simple i still ate fast food I still ate ice cream and I still ate steak 🥩 

Only one thing I did different 


I stop drinking juice and soda and switched to lacroix, Poland spring and Pepsi bubbly flavored silzer water. 


Shit has worked out I’m in shock as I eat just like I ate before expect just took out all sugary drinks and soda"
