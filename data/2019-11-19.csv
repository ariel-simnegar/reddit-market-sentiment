2019-11-20 02:22:39,but-this-one-is-mine,2,"I’m thinking when trump mentioned more tariffs he meant the hong kong bill. If it gets to his desk before a deal then there likely won’t be one as he’ll be forced to act. But he can lower or eliminate the current tariffs to make a deal. China seems kinda fucked, as the tariffs would be backed by humanitarian causes and other countries. So trump will stay silent and both sides know phase one has to be reached soon or it’ll all fall apart and get even worse when the bill reaches his desk. Thoughts?"

That’s a joke and only applicable to the last 10 years. There are so many people that have gotten so filthy rich over the last 10 years that this party has to come to an end. To just automatically assume that stocks will always go up and not understand or care about earnings and situational performance of a company is a mistake. It’ll wipe out investors like it does in every downturn. But ever since QE has started people have just gotten way ahead of themselves.
