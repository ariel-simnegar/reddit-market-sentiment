I asked her to go to arbys with me constantly, I told her I was concerned and she could talk to me if she felt depressed or anything. That I was concerned her weight could soon be significantly healthy. Once she told me she didn't even see a problem I knew nothing I said or did would change her mind or lifestyle.
