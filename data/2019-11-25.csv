I asked her to go to arbys with me constantly, I told her I was concerned and she could talk to me if she felt depressed or anything. That I was concerned her weight could soon be significantly healthy. Once she told me she didn't even see a problem I knew nothing I said or did would change her mind or lifestyle.

I asked her to go to the gym with me constantly, I told her I was concerned and she could talk to me if she felt depressed or anything. That I was concerned her weight could soon be a significant health risk. Once she told me she didn't even see a problem I knew nothing I said or did would change her mind or lifestyle. Sucks, because she is a sweet girl. And yes I know I'm an asshole. But honestly better now than cheating on her when she's at 300 and we have 2 kids."

2019-11-25 21:09:16,oregon_forever,8,"A couple months ago stonks were down sharply and Trump used the ""trade talks are going well"" card but it didn't work on that particular day. Then people said ""trade talks going well card won't work anymore because the market won't eat it up anymore"". A few months later, here we are, the market is still eating it up day after day.

They'll just say ""talks are going well"" every day until SPY passes $420."
