How much a year would the interest rate have to be to make a million dollars?

Less than $7,000 a year at 10% interest.

You will need to contribute $6,079.24 at the end of each period to reach the future value of $1,000,000.00.

FV (Future Value)	$999,999.30

PV (Present Value)	0

Yesterday I finally took a risk and it will pay off hopefully. My AMZN debit spreads will end ITM by at least $100. $1,500 invested for a $3,500 return. 

God it was stressful. I agonized all day on wether to take my small profit of $300 or let it ride. I honestly don‚Äôt know how you fucks do this every week and don‚Äôt die from stress. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs not $100,000 but it‚Äôs a lot for me. I can‚Äôt work due to leukemia, so this is what I have to rely on now. 

Anyway. Thank you retarded fuckers. Even you dumb fucks that post shitty ideas and lose everything have helped me learn on my own a great deal. And oddly enough a lot of people have been really helpful and kind despite my obvious lack of knowledge.
