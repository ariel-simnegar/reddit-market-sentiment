something like the biolite stoves which lets really really poor people generate power while they cook or boil water to make it safe to drink.

Less than $7,000 a year at 10% interest.

You will need to contribute $6,079.24 at the end of each period to reach the future value of $1,000,000.00.

FV (Future Value)	$999,999.30

PV (Present Value)	0

Yesterday I finally took a risk and it will pay off hopefully. My AMZN debit spreads will end ITM by at least $100. $1,500 invested for a $3,500 return. 

God it was stressful. I agonized all day on wether to take my small profit of $300 or let it ride. I honestly don‚Äôt know how you fucks do this every week and don‚Äôt die from stress. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs not $100,000 but it‚Äôs a lot for me. I can‚Äôt work due to leukemia, so this is what I have to rely on now. 

Anyway. Thank you retarded fuckers. Even you dumb fucks that post shitty ideas and lose everything have helped me learn on my own a great deal. And oddly enough a lot of people have been really helpful and kind despite my obvious lack of knowledge.

Buying at an ATH. Put 15% of my net worth into it; $15,000 -> 10,000+ in Fidelity, 5,000 in RH (aka my property taxes because I'm not escrowing my mortgage).

Fom my experience, after a split, the stocks shoot up almost immediately, and AAPL will continue to be hyped. I'll post here if my account RIPs.

I want to buy AAPL options, but I'm still confused how to cash out without being on the hook for getting assigned. I feel like it's going to be $430 in a month, or close to it, 425 at least.. I don't have enough money to cover a naked call though, and I know shit about Greeks, because I'm not gay. Or is it I don't know anything about being gay, because I'm not Greek. 
  
Anyway, I'm holding AAPLs atm."

I simply cannot sit back and watch this community devolve into such a primordial echo chamber/cesspool of degenerative dialect, both positive and negative, on this forum in regards to a certain The Joker character

Not only is it clear to me that this community is comprised of mentally deficient and morally corrupt verbal jihadists, it‚Äôs also clear to me that this community has no concept of anything at all, and I wonder if a significant majority of you suffer from Dissociative episodes, or some variety of psychosis. You people simply do not understand this film. It‚Äôs a film about mental illness; insanity, to be specific. It‚Äôs a deep dive into a characeter we have all come to know and love for his jokes and his tricks, in a way we‚Äôve never seen him before. Joker is one of a kind. He‚Äôs a mad man, he‚Äôs a criminal, he‚Äôs a clown, he doesn‚Äôt care about your rules or your society, and best of all, he‚Äôs Joker.

This film is a masterpiece simply because it is about Joker. We get to see a film just about our favorite character the Joker. He does it all, he goes around the city, causes mayhem, and eventually chaos. Even if it was bad, which it‚Äôs not I would still love this movie, because like some of you claim to be, and pretend, I am actually a Joker fanatic. If I had to guess, I‚Äôm in the top 10 Joker Fanatics globally, and I only say top ten because I don‚Äôt want you to think my ego is too big, I actually am probably Top 3 if not #1. We all need to come together, and stop this pointless bickering, and begin speculation on the new Joker 2: Age of Madness (which I have obtained portions of the script for) and get ready to watch the next installment of the Joker Cinematic Universe

If any of you disagree with me I will gladly debate you in the comments but I warn you, be prepared to look like a logical fool and inept on a world stage."

I simply cannot sit back and watch this community devolve into such a primordial echo chamber/cesspool of degenerative dialect, both positive and negative, on this forum in regards to a certain The Joker character

Not only is it clear to me that this community is comprised of mentally deficient and morally corrupt verbal jihadists, it‚Äôs also clear to me that this community has no concept of anything at all, and I wonder if a significant majority of you suffer from Dissociative episodes, or some variety of psychosis. You people simply do not understand this film. It‚Äôs a film about mental illness; insanity, to be specific. It‚Äôs a deep dive into a characeter we have all come to know and love for his jokes and his tricks, in a way we‚Äôve never seen him before. Joker is one of a kind. He‚Äôs a mad man, he‚Äôs a criminal, he‚Äôs a clown, he doesn‚Äôt care about your rules or your society, and best of all, he‚Äôs Joker.

This film is a masterpiece simply because it is about Joker. We get to see a film just about our favorite character the Joker. He does it all, he goes around the city, causes mayhem, and eventually chaos. Even if it was bad, which it‚Äôs not I would still love this movie, because like some of you claim to be, and pretend, I am actually a Joker fanatic. If I had to guess, I‚Äôm in the top 10 Joker Fanatics globally, and I only say top ten because I don‚Äôt want you to think my ego is too big, I actually am probably Top 3 if not #1. We all need to come together, and stop this pointless bickering, and begin speculation on the new Joker 2: Age of Madness (which I have obtained portions of the script for) and get ready to watch the next installment of the Joker Cinematic Universe

If any of you disagree with me I will gladly debate you in the comments but I warn you, be prepared to look like a logical fool and inept on a world stage."

Bullish scenario üöÄ: 323.19-324.93 is nice support. Look for it to hold today. Only other level I have is 325.93 and 326.92 which are somewhat weak. We need a nice amount of volume traded around those area for us to break AND hold 327 potentially. Like I said before, next gap is straight to 332.59. I like 325.13 as a healthy support. 

Bearish ü©∏: look for 324.93-323.58 to break down towards 322.09-321.09 area. I would scalp puts at that area. If that breaks, I can see us going down towards 318.95, which is strong. Unload all puts. 315.50 is a key level but that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch rn.

Anyone who disagrees is a simp low IQ retard

I‚Äôm not saying China created or masterminded or initiated the current situation but it all leads back to China.


- we sent our mfg overseas with the idea we would move up the value chain to be a service economy. That only sort of kind of worked but not really.

- China sent us the virus because they‚Äôre dirty scumbags tbh

- we no longer have strong mfg clusters or ‚Äúindustrial commons‚Äù because of point #1

- our people have become lazy.. a mix of culture, tv programming, getting fat and lazy from having a good economy. Our kids want to be youtube stars. Chinese kids want to be rocket scientists 

TLDR: FUCK CHINA

And fuck boomers for selling us out to them.

I simply cannot sit back and watch this community devolve into such a primordial echo chamber/cesspool of degenerative dialect, both positive and negative, on this forum in regards to a certain The Joker character

Not only is it clear to me that this community is comprised of mentally deficient and morally corrupt verbal jihadists, it‚Äôs also clear to me that this community has no concept of anything at all, and I wonder if a significant majority of you suffer from Dissociative episodes, or some variety of psychosis. You people simply do not understand this film. It‚Äôs a film about mental illness; insanity, to be specific. It‚Äôs a deep dive into a characeter we have all come to know and love for his jokes and his tricks, in a way we‚Äôve never seen him before. Joker is one of a kind. He‚Äôs a mad man, he‚Äôs a criminal, he‚Äôs a clown, he doesn‚Äôt care about your rules or your society, and best of all, he‚Äôs Joker.

This film is a masterpiece simply because it is about Joker. Even if it was bad, I would still love this movie, because like some of you claim to be, and pretend, I am actually a Joker fanatic. If I had to guess, I‚Äôm in the top 10 Joker Fanatics globally, and I only say top ten because I don‚Äôt want you to think my ego is too big, I actually am probably Top 3 if not #1. We all need to come together, and stop this pointless bickering, and begin speculation on the new Joker 2: Age of Madness (which I have obtained portions of the script for) and get ready to watch the next installment of the Joker Cinematic Universe

If any of you disagree with me I will gladly debate you in the comments but I warn you, be prepared to look like a logical fool and inept on a world stage."

He told me it's just for fun because he doesn't trade anymore, he has no time, and he's just using it to invest in a couple companies instead of keeping cash in the bank. He never showed me his account for 2 years.

I finally got a look at it today and saw he's up 2k since March. Looked through his trading history out of curiosity.

Turns out he's part of fucking thetagang wheeling and selling premiums for fun..........

2020-07-31 03:18:27,TheFuckNameYouWant,22,"For all you retards that can't be bothered to go the fuckin search bar in their Netscape browser and type in ""what is a stock split?"" You can either take my uneducated and definitely **not financial advice** word for it or go look it up yourself. 

1 share of AAPL currently trades at 400 per share. A 4 to 1 split would mean that, on Augeptobruary 31st, for every 1 share you currently hold trading at 400 you will now have 4 shares trading at 100. 

Let's break it down a little more. You could sell your 1 AAPL share and you would receive roughly $400 (US üá∫üá∏) in return. Or you could hold that 1 share and once that date arrives, you will open your Robinhood account and see that while your total account value is still $400, you now own 4 AAPL shares. 

As we know, stonks only go up. You can still make money off of these now more affordably priced shares. More people could buy into AAPL at the 100 mark. Since the average Robinhood account is worth about $247, the average Robinhood account holder would then be able to buy not just 1, but 2 shares! At the 400 mark, the average Robinhooder can either watch from the sidelines or buy fractional shares at a markup. With more investors, AAPL could eventually trade at 105 or potentially even more. 

""This is WSB I'm here to fuckin gamble with my $247 not buy shares you piece of shit.""

Okay, easy, no need for name calling. Let's keep it simple and imagine that you somehow have a 400c that doesn't expire tomorrow. For the sake of simplicity, let's say you're holding 9/11 AAPL 400c. As of 4pm today the premium on that option is $9.65. Let's pretend the split happens now. At 9.30am EST when the market opens, instead of 1 contract you'll have 4. You're now the proud owner of 4√ó 9/11 AAPL 100c and all things being equal, the premium would be $2.41. You could actually take profits *and* let some ride. 

Again, at best, I really only have a tenuous grasp on this shit. I also don't make crazy dumbass plays on things I don't understand. A lot of you fuckers really have no idea what any of this shit means. Some of you should quit trading. Anyway, thanks for coming to see my Ted Talk - For Retards today."

2020-07-31 00:16:42,ProOrlando,0,I just don‚Äôt understand how the stock market is so disconnected from the real economy. The ONLY reason the consumer made it out of this is because stimulus and unemployment. People made more money during this period of the pandemic. Reality will set in quick unless we are going to a UBI system permanently. The average medium income was up 7.4% during the pandemic LOL. We basically printed money and paid people more than they originally made. Of course people were buying iPhones and blitzing Amazon üòÇ

Despite the fact that LULU completely flopped on the past 3 earnings reports, with the big wins today, I have some renewed confidence that LULU could completely fucking spike again.  I also believe that they're a company that will benefit from a Biden presidency because the more money people have the more money they can spend on $100 yoga pants and $1500 TVs that only play workout videos.  

The Q2 consensus estimate is that LULU earnings will be down about 50% year-over-year for the quarter.  They could easily have blown past that.

Also, IMO, LULU's Q3 is going to be completely off the fucking charts with the Mirror + its warehouse sale that dumped all the old inventory."

We haven't crossed that threshold yet and it is by far the biggest game changer of the week despite the schedule packed with JPOW/fed, earnings, and GDP. Everything hinges on the stimulus bill.

No package means people have to start paying student loans, rent, and mortgages again. At the same time unemployment benefits and cash injections are being removed. It's a potent combination.

I've been a bull right along with everyone this year/summer, but this time it IS different. The only reason we've had a bull summer is because of the fast stimulus bill they passed.

And don't forget in the background covid is spiking again, hurricane season ramps up, and... Elections. Y'all are living on borrowed time.

went to pick up my mom from work and saw the apple news. i got so excited cuz that meant my initial investment would nearly quadruple by my calculations.

The app is looking to replace bank accounts similar to a Chime which isn‚Äôt public. Square now has its own debit card, stock trading in the app, beetcoin trading, and you can use it as your main direct deposit account like a normal bank account. All of these features provide a bunch of ways to nickel and dime users for fees. If their monthly active users sky rocket their revenues will too. Cash app is the most talked about P2P payment platform on twitter, which are both run by the same person, Jack Dorsey. Jack has the platform to promote cash app to the masses on lock. Venmo is old, it‚Äôs toast. Cash app is the future. Banks should be on notice. And oh yeah, the market cap is only like 50 billion. Will be 200 billion in a few months/years in my opinion.

To illustrate this, GDP for the year 2019 was $21.44 trillion. Microsoft's revenue for 2019 was $125.8 billion. So their revenue as a percentage of GDP was less than 0.6%... But they are weighted at 6%, ten times that amount, in the world's most popular index of stocks.  


Compare this with Walmart, a company with quadruple the revenue of Microsoft, and that employs 2.2 million workers, while Microsoft employs a small fraction of that. But Walmart only has an index weight of 0.69%  


It seems to me that these big tech companies are having an extremely outsized influence on how we run the country and how we save for retirement, considering that their annual profits average in the mere tens of billions."

I would say this applies to the high level ~~investing~~ gambling we do here at WallStreetBets. 

Before you can hit that 100 bagger and sell exactly at the top, you gotta hit a couple 50 baggers that end up expiring worthless because you wanted a 60 bagger.

Before you can hit 7 digits of tax-free gains in your Roth IRA, you gotta blow up a couple brokerage accounts.

So to all of you beautiful autistic fuckers on this sub that are gonna lose money tomorrow , I say to you - Don‚Äôt give up. *Don‚Äôt ever give up.* 

Many a man will go his entire life without risking anything. Living a life of quiet desperation. Yearning for more but never taking that leap.

But not you. You‚Äôre on the path to achieving your dreams. Not all of us will make it. In fact, many of the bears will never see a profit. But we‚Äôll be damned if we give up without trying.

2020-07-30 20:52:23,ProOrlando,2,Do you want to know why all this is happening. GDP fell by over 32% in the second quarter but average medium income increased by 7.4%. Meaning on average people were making more money during the pandemic than pre-pandemic by over 7.4%. Basically what that is saying is that people that got laid off the majority of them were making more on unemployment than their original jobs. Meaning they had more spending power.

>The ""being made whole"" calculation is relatively straightforward for options. Each option contract typically¬†controls¬†100 shares of an underlying security at a predetermined¬†strike price. The new share ownership is¬†generated by taking the split ratio¬†and multiplying by 100 while the new strike price is generated by taking¬†the old strike price and dividing¬†by the split ratio.

>For example, if you buy¬†a call¬†option that controls¬†100 shares of XYZ with a strike price of $75. If XYZ announces a 2:1 stock split, the contract¬†would now control¬†200 shares with a strike price of $37.50. On the other hand, if the stock split is 3 for 2, the option would control¬†150 shares with a strike price of $50."

Apple on Thursday announced in its fiscal third-quarter earnings that the Board of Directors has approved a four-for-one stock split.

Since Apple stock currently trades above $380, it means investors should expect to again have a chance to buy a share of Apple for around $100, depending on where the stock trades at the end of August.

The shares will be distributed to shareholders at the close of business on August 24, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31."

Is this because analysts are blind without guidance from companies and their estimates were way off as a result, or did analysts (due to this blindness on guidance) intentionally give companies a softball this quarter to make beating earnings easier to lessen the blow of Q2? That way companies can be like ‚Äúyes we‚Äôre down 40% YoY in revenue, but we beat earnings!‚Äù
