Don't get me wrong, I love Gold & Silver and was long since April. However I exited my positions last Friday due to upcoming volatility and I am shorting Gold & Silver for a correction.

They are both extremely overbought. If you can keep your positions the next 2 years, you will be fine. If you play ""getting quickly rich"" game, Gold & Silver are not the play here."

Senior Fed officials including Lael Brainard have suggested a consensus might be forming around a pledge to not tighten policy until inflation reaches its 2 per cent target. The Fed has come around to the belief that the coronavirus shock is disinflationary because of the drop in demand, rather than a supply-side hit that could bring shortages and drive up prices.

Another option being discussed within the Fed is to link the next rate increase to a certain level of unemployment, to guarantee that the labour market would be in sound shape before any tightening.

The change could present some pitfalls, particularly if investors perceive the new benchmarks to be confusing or ill-suited to crisis. Such concerns could unsettle financial markets, which would add to the Fed‚Äôs caution in refining the language of new guidance."

There are a couple days left, and tbh, only like a 2% chance Peloton hits the strike price of $70 before the expiration on Friday. 

So should I just sell tomorrow morning, cut my losses, and save that last $1300? Or do I wait for the coming days and cross my fingers that I can maybe gain some of that $4239 back??

If you get to phase 3 and fail you start all over, your company missed the boat, wasted tons of money and time, and causes global markets to shit the bed.  I don't know how we will time the top here, but I guess we could look at other phase 3 vaccine trials and determine a length of time before we expect results and start grabbing puts a week or two early.

Why not try nickel?!

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/canadian-miner-answers-elon-musk-s-plea-for-sustainable-nickel

This company claims to be able to answer Elon's call for more nickel but looking at the nickel mines in the world you can see there's only a couple in Canada:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nickel_mines_in_Canada

Pretty sure they don't operate a nickel mine, even checking out the archive on their website shows the domain was available just 2 years ago for $99:

https://web.archive.org/web/20180715000000*/https://canadanickel.com/

This company isn't going to produce shit, riding hype.

Vale on the other hand does operate nickel mines in Canada, along with a handful in other parts of the globe amounting to a surprisingly large number of the active nickel mines there even are:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_mine

Specifically:
> Sudbury Mine (Canada), Voisey's Bay Mine (Canada), Sorowako mine (Indonesia), VNC Goro mine (New Caledonia), Onca Puma mine (Brazil) and Thompson (Canada).

Other top producers are Norilsk (Russia) and Jinchuan (China), which are a no for me personally.

According to a USGS report on nickel deposits in North America (pg.26):

https://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/1223/report.pdf

> The largest known nickel sulfide deposits in the world are in the Sudbury district of Ontario along the outer margin of a norite-granophyre complex-the Sudbury irruptive-that rims the Sudbury basin, which is 37 miles long and 16 miles wide.

When looking at the world production:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel#World_production

New Caledonia is in the top 5 of worldwide producers are 210,000t, who has ownership stake in the largest mine in New Caledonia? Vale:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goro_mine

which they're currently in the process of selling off to some kangaroo company. Even better their ownership is exactly 69%, they're going to get a fat check from that sale and will be able to focus more on their other operations (hopefully Canada to be the one who really answers Musk's call for nickel). 

Vale hasn't had a problem-free past:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vale_(company)#Disasters

but I'm pretty sure more recent and yet-to-occur disasters will pretty much overshadow any past disaster. They're not allowed to operate tailing dams in Brazil anymore anyway so that mess should all be priced in by this point.

I'd keep going because there's so much DD to be done to crack open this nut, but I'm just going to say yolo at this point, I bought before doing any of this DD and am up a little, good enough for me.

They got their own ships, trains, all kinds of shit. I don't know anything about the nickel business, but I did buy $12 8/07 calls and $14 9/18 calls on 7/23 and they've so far gained 56% and 61% respectively. They're still a little off from pre-covid-crash levels and earnings are on 7/29.

Do what you will with this information, I don't know how any of this works.

Also their stock ticker (VALE) is the same as the name of their company, that's pretty cool.

TL;DR: VALE $12 8/07 and $14 9/18 calls"

Ok cool, so I ended up positive on the trade but due to the commission fees and the premium paid, I ended up losing $11 dollars

-Just checked ToS now
-The order to buy +100 shares was CANCELLED (this obviously wasn't me because it says right on the order that I'm incapable of cancelling it)
-Now I am short 100 shares of SPY, and it's going up AH so I'm losing more money?

2020-07-28 02:16:52,mattrob1995,-6,"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, *Duke*. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on *Duke* where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think *Invisible Touch* was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can  practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little. Take the lyrics to *Land of Confusion*. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. *In Too Deep* is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like *In The Air Tonight* and *Against All Odds*. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, **eat it**. But I also think Phil Collins  works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist. And I stress the word **artist**."

But now I have 2 kids and a sizable portfolio that has gained value through passive investing. I know I wouldn't normally belong here. But, my business has always provided a pretty solid view of consumption in america via their disposal volume. While I am too much of a pussy to put my own skin in the game as I would rather protect my assets and gain relative value against the overall market decline. I would like you degens to look at REITs that are publicly traded.   


Specifically, look at ones that are solely dedicated to Class A buildings in NYC or have similar assets spread across major metropolitan cities in america. Without getting specific, some of these REITs are trading 4% off their all time highs and their future is fucking bleak. Friend of mine in commercial real estate is telling me they can't move a square foot right now and their current offer is 20 months free up front on a 10 year lease.   


These companies are going to crash and burn. Obviously, timing is everything. But I figured some of you autists could look into this and find some low hanging fruit. Good Luck."

He held onto over a million dollars of it for years based on the hope that historical averages would cause it to triple in value. Ultimately it was all sold for a loss. Place your money somewhere it will work for you. The dollar isn‚Äôt collapsing and metals no longer hold their historic value.

2020-07-27 20:08:28,Jabbermouth,136,"There‚Äôs an old saying in Texas, I know it‚Äôs in Tennessee, probably in Texas - that says ‚Äúsometimes in life you have to break down before you can build yourself back up again‚Äù.

I would say this applies to the high level ~~investing~~ gambling we do here at WallStreetBets. 

Before you can hit that 100 bagger and sell exactly at the top, you gotta hit a couple 50 baggers that end up expiring worthless because you wanted a 60 bagger.

Before you can hit 7 digits of tax-free gains in your Roth IRA, you gotta blow up a couple brokerage accounts.

So to all of you beautiful autistic fuckers on this sub that are gonna lose money next week, I say to you - Don‚Äôt give up. *Don‚Äôt ever give up.* 

Many a man will go his entire life without risking anything. Living a life of quiet desperation. Yearning for more but never taking that leap.

But not you. You‚Äôre on the path to achieving your dreams. Not all of us will make it. In fact, many of us will never see a profit. But we‚Äôll be damned if we give up without trying."
