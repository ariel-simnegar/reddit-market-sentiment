**With trade the major factor driving the Stoxx 600 Index in the near term, there's more upside in this market than downside.**   
The tales of woe regarding the deterioration of U.S.-China relations seem more than a bit overstated ahead of high-level talks this week. The U.S. has been vocal on the issue of Beijing's treatment of the Uighur ethnic minority for years, and the threat of blacklisting Hikvision and some of its peers has been public since May. These aren't new issues, and moves made by the White House are more purposely timed than they are harsh. The inverse way of looking at the latest Xinjiang-related measures is that the U.S. is looking tough before scaling back that antagonism over human-rights to focus on smaller deal that buys political time before the 2020 election.

With a bias toward the White House choosing political self-preservation over further slowing down the world economy, the bearish drift in European stocks opens the door for an upside move. And the SXXP can enjoy its value-like status that JPMorgan strategists touted last week."

What do you guys think about his crash prediction? Probably not likely in the next year or two, however not a bad thought for the future. 

Tldr, basically we are consuming more energy as the economy grows and credit is leveraging more growth and more energy consumption, renewables just add to the consumed energy and once it energy starts to cost more for the same utility, we'll experience a crash...

They’re not showing any leeway in Trump’s major demands. Since this round isn’t like the 15% biggie on the horizon on Dec. 15, I’m wondering if any potential retaliation from China will be at the fringes and not a major ramping up of broad-line tariffs which could be reserved for end of this year or early next (if December tariffs get delayed).

Talks falling apart this week will bring the market down a bit more, sure, but I’m guessing the next major escalation from China is reserved for these December tariffs and deeper into election season. Maybe another minor retaliation will occur right after/if the Fed cuts rates again. Who the fuck knows, but I’m guessing these next two weeks won’t be as bad as early August if China goes home and doesn’t ramp things up bigly.

I remember when Lyft was IPO'ing all the analysts were hyping it and talking about all this good stuff. Now I realize half of that is they need something to hype up and talk about because nothing else was really going on at the time and CNBC needs to fill air space..

But just imagine you're a drooling boomer tuning in and buying stock based on these blowhards half baked opinions and then being way down months later. It makes it all seem like the whole financial media is just a big fraud, basically entertainment."

>bought a 291c for 10/9 (next day) for $89 when I thought SPY bottomed during the morning bullshit

>Followed it through the day and saw it mooning 1-2:30PM

>Got nervous during a slight dip and sold at $97

>About 10-30 mins later it mooned to about 150 per contract (top price today was 291.80....not ITM for me but very close)

>Cried at my possible $60ish profit I missed out on

>Rejoiced when I still made a return and saw it drill to ~289

Anyways...it was fun. I work a blue collar job so it's hard for me to do day trades. I learned to *maybe* have more diamond hands but all in all I'm OK losing ~60 bucks and keeping my initial investment instead of selling for 50% of my contract.
