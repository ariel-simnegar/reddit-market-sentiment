**With trade the major factor driving the Stoxx 600 Index in the near term, there's more upside in this market than downside.**   
The tales of woe regarding the deterioration of U.S.-China relations seem more than a bit overstated ahead of high-level talks this week. The U.S. has been vocal on the issue of Beijing's treatment of the Uighur ethnic minority for years, and the threat of blacklisting Hikvision and some of its peers has been public since May. These aren't new issues, and moves made by the White House are more purposely timed than they are harsh. The inverse way of looking at the latest Xinjiang-related measures is that the U.S. is looking tough before scaling back that antagonism over human-rights to focus on smaller deal that buys political time before the 2020 election.

With a bias toward the White House choosing political self-preservation over further slowing down the world economy, the bearish drift in European stocks opens the door for an upside move. And the SXXP can enjoy its value-like status that JPMorgan strategists touted last week."

Talks falling apart this week will bring the market down a bit more, sure, but I‚Äôm guessing the next major escalation from China is reserved for these December tariffs and deeper into election season. Maybe another minor retaliation will occur right after/if the Fed cuts rates again.
