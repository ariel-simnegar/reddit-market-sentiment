\- DAL is currently at 31.10$, however based on the cash flow, it is expected to be traded 79,15$. That means it is 60% undervalued. This makes a bit sense.

\- They have a high level of debt. Debt to equity is 60%. DAL's debt to equity ratio has reduced from 111.5% to 70.6% over the past 5 years. DAL's debt is well covered by operating cash flow (77.7%). DAL's interest payments on its debt are well covered by EBIT (22.1x coverage).

\- DAL's dividend (5.18%) is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the US market (5.67%).

Looking at debt and dividend, it doesn't make sense and I still don't understand. Buffet bought these stocks because it was undervalued?"

Yesterday a 12, 16 and a 28 year old arrived to the intensive care unit. The 28 year old was in prime condition except for high fever, in less than a hour he needed 12l of oxygen per minute, today he's all blue and they believe he most likely will die. Out of 10 doctors on that unit, 5 are remaning since the rest just quit their jobs. 

The nurses are trying to prevent people from commiting suicide since thats what the patients are trying, they are straight up begging for just dying instead of this.

Anyway, the market still has a lot lower to go. We're in some denial stage rn because we're all hopefully thinking the quarantining is working. County near me is projecting, optimistically, with a long and tight quarantine, 0.2% mortality. That's 2000 people for every 1 million. Assuming the rest of the country implements the quarantine as well as we do, which they won't, that's *optimistically* 600,000 dead in the US. Could well go over 1m. 

Sure, 1m dead (mostly old people) will hit some industries harder than others in the long term. But people are going to freak the fuck out once the death count starts really pumping. Go cash gang tomorrow at market open and put some of your money in puts with June/July strike dates... trust me"

2020-03-26 05:15:18,zg44,30,"""Priced in"" gets thrown around too casually; markets are not all knowing or all seeing; they can only price in events based on the information that we have right now as well as what investors hope happens.

Our information about the coronavirus situation is mostly incomplete and will be so for the next 8-10 days, that's the point at which we can predict with much better certainty what the trajectory for the US is.  The only states in the US that we have good information on are Washington and NY.  Washington appears to have suppressed its curve after the initial rise, and NY didn't.  Most other states appear to be somewhere in-between.

Right now markets are pricing in a decent chance that large numbers of people can return to work in the US in late April as well as a virtually 0% chance of a second wave of infections that's as big or bigger than the first wave.

I happen to believe those two assumptions are incorrect, but of course I can be wrong.

The main thing that gives me hesitation on the bear case is that it's very possible that the death rate has been wildly overstated and is actually well below 1%.  In that case then there are a lot of people getting minor coronavirus infections and simply not being tested or seeing anything serious from it.  If that pool of people is substantial enough, then actually it will make sense to get people working sooner rather than later.

I think markets are hoping for that, and that's why we're seeing something of a rally generating here along with the stimulus/Fed QE.

But if you want to short this rally, then be patient.  If markets are misjudging the coronavirus pandemic, then there is quite a bit more downside to go later on, and you don't have to predict way in advance what's going to happen (see the original slide from S&P 3400 to 2200).  You shouldn't try to short every bounce in what looks like a sustainable bear market rally, if there's further downside ahead, it's not going to all happen in one pre-market session.  And you should want markets to overshoot upwards (say around S&P 2700-2800) so you get good entry points on your puts."

She meant ""honest"", so let me be honest. Making money is not like what I thought it would be. This business kills the part of life that is essential, the part that has nothing to do with business. For the past two years, my insides have felt like they've been eating themselves. All the people that I respected won't talk to me anymore, except through lawyers. People want an authority to tell them how to value things, but they choose this authority not based on facts or results. They choose it because it feels authoritative and familiar.

In the years that followed, hundreds of bankers and rating agencies executives went to jail.

The projected number is **nearly five times as many initial claims as were recorded during the peak of the Great Recession**. In the week ended March 28, 2009, about 665,000 new claims were filed. That was second only to the week ended Oct. 2, 1982, when 695,000 first-time claims were filed. The Labor Department's records go back to 1967.

So if you make above the threshold in 2020 even if you made less in 2018 you will have to pay the money back and vice versa if you made less in 2020. Something to think about to try and reduce your Adjusted Gross Income in 2020 to qualify for the check.

We are witnessing the biggest bull vs bear battle in history guys. The bear has a major advantage over the feds right now because the bubble has been popped while the feds have already used up all their ammos. They got nothing left. They just simply cannot inflate air into a bubble that has already been popped.

The only thing that makes sense right now is to let the market fall and let investors buy up every dip. Inflating the bubble right now is a sure way to destroy the USD which is tied to the US economy.

Don't go long at least until Fall. Some dip buyers may get lucky, but chances are they'll end up losing their gains or break even if they are lucky."

2020-03-26 02:12:17,pakmann,23,"Just did some math for US cases and deaths. Right now on average, for every 42 new cases, 1 person dies that day. Keep in mind this is based off only confirmed cases as of yesterday. 

With the current average rate of increase per day of 30% for cases and 17% for deaths, we'll have 120,000 cases by Friday with 2857 deaths. That seems pretty realistic giving the current numbers. 

If that keeps pace, that means 8 million cases with 191,000 deaths in the US alone by 4/12 (Easter). Obviously that's way higher than anywhere else has come close to and seems way less likely, but only represents 2.4% of the population being infected and 0.05% of the population dying. From that perspective it doesn't seem as crazy, but if it did get that severe, it probably wouldn't happen that fast.

This also suggests we‚Äôll pass Italy for number of cases by Friday and pass them in deaths by next Saturday.

2020-03-26 01:55:46,kkkodaxerooo,10,"While watching Jaws the other day, I was struck at the similarities of the level of denial exhibited by the the character of the film's Mayor of Amity Island, Larry Vaugn, portrayed by actor Murray Hamilton and the rational (and increasingly alarmed newly hired chief of police) Martin Brody, portrayed by Roy Scheider

Imagine the Mayor is Donald Trump and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases is chief Brody

In one of the first of several scenes portraying the ever increasing danger and impending doom, Brody finds the mangled body of the first victim on the beach

Brody wants to shut the beaches down immediately.

The Mayor, having just been told that the police chief was going to post warnings of a shark attack around the island locates Brody on a local ferry and tries to reason with the police chief that any warnings about a shark can seriously impact the economy of Amity Island.

To quote the Mayor's warning to chief Martin Brody as Brody attempts to warn the islanders about the deadly shark attack that just killed it's first victim...

""Martin, you say barracuda, the people say ""What??"", you say Shark and we have a panic on our hands on the 4th of July!""

If the police chief had his way, the beaches would all be shut down to prevent any further deaths but because of the town politics, he can only take small baby steps which, after each new attack, proving the failure of this piecemeal approach, only proves that his way was the correct one.

It isn't until the 4th attack in which Brody's son almost dies that Brody loses his patience with the mind boggling ignorance of the Mayor and takes over.

I only wish it was that easy.

Our president is a danger to all of us.

Dear Mr. president, Listen to Anthony Fauci.

Our Great White Shark, known as COVID-19 is now on a feeding frenzy in the US and you are actually considering serving the American people up as a veritable smorgasbord.

Every day was green except for Friday. Friday I believe it hit a breaker.. might have been the first time a breaker was hit.. In retrospect the following week it was explained that the stimulus was used during the week so investors wouldn't  continue to drive down the market. Instead they let it happen on Friday as to give the investors time to cool down.

I believe the same tactic has been deployed this week. So, meh day tomorrow, and put printer for Friday.

Tony Dwyer called a bear rally as well to end around \~2575. Where he then predicts another huge fall.

[https://twitter.com/dwyerstrategy/status/1242849711373066240](https://twitter.com/dwyerstrategy/status/1242849711373066240)

""We have been talking about a post-crash relief rally that recoups at least 30% of the loss from peak as was the case in prior crashes that were similar in nature. That would suggest a relief rally target of SPX \~2575.""

In addition another trader I follow had some info regarding the exact same move:[https://northmantrader.com/2020/03/25/monster-move/](https://northmantrader.com/2020/03/25/monster-move/)

2020-03-25 23:24:11,expander2,25,"Alright since the dick sucking mods won‚Äôt let me post regularly I‚Äôll post here assholes. 

Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 3/24-3/25. I‚Äôm your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last post still stands and holds some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

We are gonna start this one out with some news I guess. Waffle House has closed 365 locations. If fucking waffle house closes then you know we are absolutely going to get plowed by The Wuflu. Make sure to wear your old panties cause Winnie the Dictator is not gonna wait for you to slide them off, he's gonna rip them from your ass.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokd6w/waffle_house_closes_365_locations_drill_team_6/) gives some more details about the whole situation. Waffle House says that things are not getting better then that tells us to re-examine whatever the hell is going on out there.

As a matter of fact, I have a lot of shit that points to the fact that America is fuk. Our[ Autist Investigator‚Ñ¢](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9cks/did_a_little_dd_on_new_york/) of the day is saying we as a people are dumb, stupid, idiots that only care about ourselves (which is true) and that this is only the beginning. You bulls thought that was[ the bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fogfty/the_good_news_and_bad_news_djia_makes_best_single/) huh? Think again retards. I hope you made some money off of this pump because it sure as hell is not gonna last.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/folqfl/comparison_of_1929_2008_2020_spx/) is a fantastic comparison of the depression, recession, and COVID19 fuckening. This is a very good technical analysis that only like 15 of you will understand, so for everyone else you got juked by the fed so get ready for blood.

This brings me to my next DD. ""Priced in"" doesn't mean the price WILL NOT CHANGE. It means the market is already anticipating what will happen and is reacting accordingly. My man[ u/Um5acentric](https://www.reddit.com/user/Um5acentric/) wrote a[ great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo5tx7/what_priced_in_actually_means/) explaining what ""Priced in"" means and even gave an example so the smooth-brains could understand.

Now to the real DD. I hope you idiots listened to me the other day when I said puts in India because guess what? Here come some tendies. I will repeat myself; Mexico (EWW), Germany (EWG), France (EWQ), India (INDA), and Australia (EWA). These are all decent options. Not Brazil (EWZ) as its already down like 60% or something stupid and not Japan (EWJ) because they seem to have their shit together. Read the DD on my last summary for more info on India and Mexico.

Next Medtronic (MDT). MDT makes ventilators. Ventilators are a hot item at the moment because of Boomer Doomer. Buy calls? If you want but who fucking knows at this point.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnxxpy/mdt_the_hidden_beer_virus_gem/) gets into it a little more than I can here.

[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohxo4/mtch_717_90110c/) says Match (MTCH) which includes Tinder is going to go up because everyone is horny from the Beer Flu. Our wives/wives' boyfriends/dogs/fingers arent enough so random strangers from an app will have to do. He also explains a bunch of shit about profitability and the like the maybe read it. Could make some money, could not. Such is the nature of WSB.

Now, a little mayo for you tards to eat (that means this will help you).[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/) explains how to make money by looking at how companies handle their bond debt and are gonna be able to pay it off. If they cant, short the fuck out of them. If they can pay the debt then find another company dipshit, we can't spoon feed you every play. This is your knowledge of the day so take it in, gargle it a bit then swallow that shit because we don't spit around here.

Finally, a new edition that I'm gonna try and do every time;

Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is[ this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnws9y/no_school_i_got_your_history_lesson_fucktards/). I have no fucking clue what he's saying but he may have ate too many bath bombs.

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

TLDR; Buckle in boys cause we are going down more. The next few weeks will be bloody so hold the line and Valhalla awaits. None of you know what ""Priced in"" means, Medtronic and Match look like good options, and playing on companies bond debt seems like a good idea.

Plays; Puts in EWW, EWG, EWQ, INDA, and EWA. Calls in MDT and MTCH.

Went to Wharton, had a grandfather who knew about the nuclear. Such big numbers. People understand the impact of numbers and borders and Chi-Nuh. Such walls. So big. Trump made everyone a very ~~rich~~ ~~enslaved~~ perfect, perfect, never been better American patriot. May white bearded Jesus bless America. Bears are gay...Barron said so. Good night."

2020-03-25 22:28:06,zg44,5,"It's hard to know what any single market move is a reaction to, but that end of day spike was probably just profit taking before the unemployment claims number comes in...

There is clearly some strength to this bear market rally compared to all the previous up days, but it's going to have to absorb a ton of bad news on unemployment and the coronavirus starting tomorrow.

The biggest worry to me is that the US is pursuing a scattershot policy of each state doing what it wants instead of a national lockdown.

That means even if we get to April 15-20 and see improving numbers in NY/Cali, there might be other lagging states that are getting much worse around that time.  It's going to be hard to send people back to work anywhere if there's still potential for further spread and the creation of a 2nd wave that would crest in May-June."

Honestly my dudes, small cap pharma is gonna be one of the best buys. Specifically hormonal drugs, allergy medication, gene therapies, specific medical devices, novel neurological medication that is the companies blockbuster. US centered, US made. Lotta small caps have nothing to do with global trade and still bring in 50-100% yoy revenues every single year. These companies are all below 52 week lows. Do your own DD but none of these companies have had less scripts since this started. Always more. Will exceed all earnings and yearly 10ks. Most will. I won't give any specific recommendations because I do believe we have one more big drop but my eyes are open and am compiling data for good entries and an actual DD post
