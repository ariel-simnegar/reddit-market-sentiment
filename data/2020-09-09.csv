In any case, the option is now worth $3.55. I believe this is due more to the IV drop as opposed to the underlying share price drop.

Questions.

1. Why did the IV drop so significantly when the market dropped? I understand IV crush at it relates to an earnings scenario. I would expect with the market so volatile, the IV would not drop as it did. More market volatility == IV goes down?
2. What will be the driver for IV to rise?
3. Is this option toast? It seems based on optionsprofitcalc even if underlying goes way up I still lose unless IV goes back up.

When the uncertainty related to a stock increases and the option prices are traded to higher prices, IV will increase. This is sometimes referred to as an ‚Äú**IV expansion**.‚Äù  


On the opposite side of IV expansion is ‚Äú**IV contraction**.‚Äù This occurs when the fear and uncertainty related to a stock diminishes. As this happens, the stock‚Äôs options decrease in price which results in a decrease in IV. 

Has the fear and uncertainty diminished? I don't think so.

Thanks for any insight."

I met up with a gambler and we were both too tired to sleep. We took turns starin out the window at the darkness when the boredom overtook us and he began to speak. He said You got to know when to hold em, know when the fold em, know when to walk away and no when to run. Never count your money when you're sitting at the table - they'll be time enough for counting when the deal is done."

PTON & AAPL Tendies

Anyone see PTON is having a virtual analyst and investor [presentation](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-host-virtual-investor-and-analyst) beginning at the exact same time on Tuesday that AAPL is starting their Watch event... purely a coincidence??? I think not..

According to 9to5Mac, the new PTON bike will additionally feature Apple‚Äôs [Gym Kit](https://www.google.com/amp/s/9to5mac.com/2020/09/08/peloton-launches-new-bike-gymkit-apple-watch/amp/).. enabling ‚Äúdeeper integration with the Apple Watch, allowing for one-tap Apple Watch connectivity and heart rate tracking...‚Äù 

That said I think we see a PTON mention during the AAPL event, especially given the current global situation. 

I bet you AAPL will additionally make a TV spot featuring at least one new PTON product and it‚Äôs integration with the new watch. 

Remember the AAPL Watch has always been branded as a watch that has health/fitness capabilities. PTON has been and is the center of fitness at home equipment and even now fitness classes during this pandemic. If there‚Äôs ever been an opportunity for them to work together, it‚Äôs now. 

My positions are posted below, and keep in mind PTON ER is tomorrow AH.. all I know so far is upgrades up the wazoo the past few days, production is now to run 24hrs a day now to meet demand for bikes, and we have new/cheaper products...

Positions: 
PTON 90c 10/16, 100c 9/18, 90c 01/2022
AAPL 125c 9/18"

Yeah, too much confidence and greed still. I may not be right about tomorrow. But overall, too much confidence and greed says we‚Äôre not done dropping. And with the 9/11 call volume I expect we are pinned or down through the end of the week. And if everyone goes all in again on 9/18 calls it‚Äôll continue to be flat or trickle down.

**Edit to explain lol:**

The top half is putting ur entire buying power on the next play. 

* Start with $1k, make 20% return ($200)  -- BP = $1.2K
* Put $1.2k on the next play where you make 20%, --  BP = $1,440

The bottom half is only putting 50% of BP on each trade.

* So starting balance is $1k, and you put $500 (50%) on a trade. 
* Make 20% ($100). BP = $1,100
* So next trade you put $550 (half of BP) on the trade and make 20% -- BP = $1,210
* repeat. Much more conservativ

Unrealistic to hit every play in a row tho. just thought it was interesting."

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

What Happened: Discussions revolve around multiple options, including a sale or a partial sale that is likely to involve the restructuring of the video app, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

Government officials taking part in the talks are mainly concerned about the security of TikTok data and making it inaccessible to the Chinese government, the sources told the Journal.

So many new vids on it  

I‚Äôm happy tho good 

But it amazing to me
How Tesla is profitable for everybody all the Youtubers like Jeremy and others get major views 

With just the word  ‚ÄúTesla ‚Äú

That how I know we will see all time highs 

So many people are working over time to pump Tesla and as well as buildings massive customer loyalty and MM will not let the Tesla money trading stop 

No they need to keep it volatile up and down to cash In Big big with premium

Do I have to buy all 100 shares at once before exercising it, or can I buy like 50, exercise those, and then buy the next 50 to exercise those?

EDIT: Maybe I'm not making myself clear. 

I'm looking at the Robinhood explanation for it right now, it's the basis of my question.

I understand that a put option allows me the option to sell 100 shares at the strike price. But Robinhood says I must own the shares before I can sell them at said strike price/exercise the option.

I'm asking if, once I am beyond the break even point (strike price-premium), I need to buy all 100 shares at once to sell all at once or if I can buy them one at a time to sell."

1.	Starting off with a higher number gives you a sense of accomplishment early on and keeps you going when you're only 20-30 pages in and would normally give up. 
2.	Towards the end, the smaller page number keeps you focused on the end goal and prevents you from being complacent, taunting you with how little is left and preventing you from putting the book down till you're done.

Below I have political analysis for why gun stonks are a sure thing between now and November, but all you really need to know is that they will all go up. 

I was a poli sci Major in undergrad and I can absolutely promise you that by October guns are all anyone will be talking about. And even Joe will have to take a somewhat pro-gun stance (though still anti by American standards) because Pennsylvania is so important this election. Republicans also always lean into the gun issue hard in the debates because it's how they insure that waivering Republicans fall in line. (Third debate with Hillary in 2016 wS a major turning point because of Heller discussion) 

Don't forget that sales are at record highs, will continue to get higher as riots continue, will get even higher when Biden talks about an assault weapons ban (always happens, that's why gun sales we huge under Obama), and best of all there is no real risk of ban because of the Supreme Court make up. 

Finally, though sales have been very high stock gains have been restrained because there were concerns about supply problems. Luckily based on recent earnings we know that's not the case.

Gains here could be HUGE bros, don't miss out."

4. Repeat until you have only one group of 100 people left. 
5. Take the last 1 person out, leaving you with only 99 people who are not in the 1%. (Optional) Dismember people from the 99 group to get even more (parts of) people in the 1%.

2020-09-09 23:54:33,noentic,12,"## Daily Market and Options Summary for September 9th -

## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&P 500 rebounded 2.0% on Wednesday amid gains across all 11 of its sectors, although the market did lose some steam into the close. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.7% amid strength in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.6%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) underperformed. 
* Eight sectors advanced more than 1.0%, but the 3.4% gain in the information technology sector was the most influential given its top-weighted position in the S&P 500. Note, it was also the sector that led the market lower yesterday. 
* The materials (+2.6%) and consumer discretionary (+2.3%) sectors also outpaced the benchmark index, while the energy sector (+0.6%) was today's laggard despite a 3.5% gain in oil prices ($38.05/bbl, +$1.29).
* Today's rebound was largely described as a technical bounce following a three-day period in which the S&P 500 fell 7% from its record high and the Nasdaq fell 10% from its record high. There were no fundamental news catalyzing the buying activity, and there were several negative-sounding headlines that the market brushed aside. 
* To name a few, AstraZeneca (AZN 53.64, -1.07, -2.0%) paused its COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK due to a serious adverse reaction in a patient, there was some reported pessimism in Washington regarding another coronavirus relief package before the election, and several airlines remained cautious about the travel demand outlook. 
* Separately, shares of lululemon athletica (LULU 323.93, -25.87, -7.4%) and Slack (WORK 25.24, -4.08, -13.9%) fell 7% and 14%, respectively, despite providing better-than-expected earnings reports.
* U.S. Treasuries ended the session mixed. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.13%, while the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.70%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 93.24.
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Producer Price Index for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Thursday.

2020-09-09 23:08:09,leftyjef,4,"So after realizing I could of turned my last weeks calls into puts using a credit spread, I spent the weekend really studying spreads. But here's something nobody covered.

I have multiple PTON spreads, 83/95 and 87.50/100. I'm profiting. However not nearly enough. Not because I capped it with a spread but because the IV on the short legs is so high and will be through close tomorrow.

I don't want to hold through earnings, but right now I see little choice or else I'm just taking peanuts.

Do any off you autist have a strategy for curing this. I don't want to buy back the short and all that IV but I'm starting to think I'm better off watching earnings and if it drops to say 90, I would profit more than I am now."

The company is drowning in debt and burnt through nearly 300M in cash in Q1 before the pandemic took hold completely. Since then all theatres were shuttered, it kept burning cash. They opened 70% of them recently but are heavily discounting the tickets and concessions which will no doubt hurt revenue and margins. 

&#x200B;

Now the million-dollar question is, how the hell is this stock back to pre-COVID prices? Keep in mind it was failing back then too! Now with Disney releasing Mulan on its platform, other entertainment studios are bound to follow because they don't have to share half their revenues with the theatres. There is bound to be a correction prior to the election and with their earnings due on November 4th, I think it makes sense to buy the cheapest in the money puts, no way they have blowout earnings, in fact, I am confident they will miss analyst estimates by a longshot.

2020-09-09 22:47:29,suckafuckduck,2,"I figured out how to make money from tesla finally based on your avg cost. Buy a call 5-10% above your avg cost, sell a covered call exp one week after, around $10 under the strike of said bought call, one week after the bought exp. Have atleast a month of time on your gay little spread, sell the bought call when tesla inevitably sky rockets, at the peak autism if you can time it. Buy back the sold call to close the position when tesla inevitably gets clapped. Pros: you will most likely get +/- $300 credit just for opening said position, if your sold call gets assigned then you will net 5-10% above your avg cost, or it expires worthless and you just made mad profit on the bought call. Cons: you need to buy more shares and gains are capped if tesla lands on the moon of Mars. So buy a weekly when tesla gets clapped at lower strike and exercise it, rinse and repeat. Also con, u can't be poor and not afford 100 shares of tesla."

But I am now 2nd guessing 5 $ZM 09/18 370p that I bought at 3:58 pm today. Although I have more than one week but theta (-0.99) is kind of high with a reasonable IV (79.9 %).

It is called IV crush because Ivan had just finished purchasing a large lot of call options of Levis-Strauss, when a large vodka still installed inside of the stock exchange fell, crushing him underneath and leaving him unable to exercise his call options, causing them to expire worthless. This forced the Moscow Stock Exchange to take physical delivery of 3000 cartons of Levi's 501 jeans, an event that ensured that the brokers on the floor were the most fashionable for years to come."""

On Tuesday, sold VXX puts out of panic from the climb in the morning, switching to calls and lose money again.

In these cases, I made all the right calls and ended up losing money still. Those positions are all against WSB too. When people are shilling for a recovery Friday in the morning, I had the bright idea before the pump to hold VXX calls.

2020-09-09 21:17:04,WowKay100,5,"Microsoft didn't get TikTok but it's honestly fine. The next line of XBOX series is going to absolutely dominate. $25 or $35 a month for an xbox + xbox  game pass ultimate + EA pass is a deal that has taken the gaming world by storm. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I have xbox game pass ultimate, and it is worth every single dollar. Fantastic business model, the Netflix of gaming has really come. Microsoft sales are going to be on fire, and when they outsell the PS5, after the initial finance is over they will increase the price and collect crazy subscription fees for years to come."

2020-09-09 20:23:16,RayCashIsTrashDalio,45,"how i will come back from my losses:

1. dont buy shit till at least 45-60 minutes after market opens to avoid high iv in the morning

2. take profits if it hits 50% every time and look for the next play

3. even if it looks like itll keep going up/down, wait till a dip/pump to buy calls/puts. dont fomo in. there will always be a better opportunity

4. dont get too fucking greedy and roll all profits into a higher strike. 

5. dont always sell your positions for a loss 30 minutes after getting them. selling only at a loss every single time means youll never be up, only down. 

6. sometimes its good to be cash gang. if youre unsure, dont play. there will always be opportunities, you just have to be patient. you dont need a position open 24/7. its better to have a 100% chance of 10% profit and doing that over and over than a 50/50 gamble on a 50% profit or bust. one bad move will cost you everything. 

7. if none of the above works go full retard and pray for the best. at worst you suck dicks in the back alleyway of the wendys for the rest of your life"

Main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

S&P can't go down by design! This is why they will never allow scams like Tesla in.

No matter what happens only companies that make money are allowed in SPY.

As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck buddy! There‚Äôs a table that always comes up black! You‚Äôre gonna be so damn rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‚ÄòBig Jay‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is your lucky day.‚Äù he whispers to you as he leans in close. ‚ÄúFor a short time I‚Äôve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you‚Äôll be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

‚ÄúRed‚Äù you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.

You see the confused expression on Big Jay‚Äôs face as he spins the wheel. ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù he calls with a sigh.

‚ÄúThis game is¬†fucking¬†RIGGED!‚Äù you shout with fury"
