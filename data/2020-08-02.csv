**The Past Week, In A Nutshell**

What Happened: Stocks closed the week practically unchanged after mixed reactions to a slew of blow-out earnings results.

Remember This: “Although the stock market will certainly experience pullbacks, disappointments and corrections along the way, the horses have just begun this race and investors should be wary of cashing in a winning Superfecta ticket too early,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.

Key Events: Earnings; ADP Employment, Challenger Layoffs; Weekly Unemployment Claims; ISM Indices; ISM New York Business Conditions; Construction Spending; Home Prices; Vehicle Sales And Prices.

Fundamental: S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings estimates at a higher pace.

* Blow-out earnings show tech dominates as 10% of jobs may never return.

* ECB extends dividend ban despite banks’ resistance to COVID-19 effects.

* Rates will remain near the zero bound for many years to come.

* As GDP tanked, personal income grew thanks to government support.

* U.S. specialty stores have been hit hard with downgrades.

* Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) limits losses, sees better second half.

* Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to defer quarterly payments on retooling loan.

* Outlook for U.S. value stocks looks uncertain in light of cloudy economic picture.

* Poll shows funds favoring bonds over stocks on surging coronavirus infections.

* U.S. consumer spending presses ahead; declining income poses challenges.

* Trump to sign an executive ban on TikTok amid pressure on Chinese owner to sell.

* China accounts for nearly one-quarter of Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) revenue.

* Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in talks to buy TikTok’s U.S. business.

* Tech stocks may be growing at the expense of others, or the economy itself.

* Congressional Testimony: Lawmakers question big tech about competition, startups.

* Benchmark yield dips; convexity-hedging would accelerate a decline in yields.

* The public’s view of almost every industry improved since the beginning of the virus.

* Exxon Mobile Corporation (NYSE:XOM) struggles to reverse failed bets.

* Renters owe $21.5B in back rent; Republicans and Democrats fight over relief.

* Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) start COVID-19 trials.

* Big tech must take relative market cap from other sectors to keep growing.

* Fed chief says coronavirus surge is slowing U.S. economic recovery.

* General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) to pay off loan if recovery continues.

* Fed buying spree could move to long end of yield curve, analysts say.

* eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) classifieds sale not a big hit to revenue.

* Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) guidance and delays are credit negative.

* Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) DOJ investigation remains open.

* Hurricane Douglas heads toward Hawaii, threatening losses for insurers.

* Virus surge and the expiration of relief measures imperil economic recovery.

* August the best month for the dollar and volatility, worst for bonds.

* Second COVID-19 wave forces new travel curbs around the globe.

* Reported cases and fatalities fell in states hard hit by the coronavirus.

* Rural small businesses may not survive another coronavirus shutdown.

* The housing market defies expectations amid economic turmoil.

* Far more investors are opting to take physical delivery when gold contracts end.

* Good performance in one period does not predict outperformance in another.

* The U.S-China cold war would redirect energy flows, alter global supply chains.

* China is buying American but not enough to hit the trade deal targets.

* Managing the dynamic reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet over time.

* Plentiful evidence that the resurgence of COVID-19 has choked the recovery.

* Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) slashed production of its biggest twin-engined jets.

* Sentiment: 20.2% Bullish, 31.3% Neutral, 48.5% Bearish as of 7/29/2020."

CNBC is legit retarded. Stocks are not rising because of earnings season.

China reported a strong PMI beating analyst expectations, indicating that they are out of recession. Germany, Italy, Spain, Italy and Euro area also beat expectations on PMI, Europe is also out of recession and that is causing the rally. All data came out a few hours ago.

If you want a true lotto ticket, AAPL might possibly hit 500 (or 490) before 8/30. Potentially 10-bagger opportunity right here. 

Nobody is profit taking on AAPL before the stock split. Everyone is expecting a ride up to the split, and a post-split ride up as retail jumps in at the lower price. Any options you buy with expiry after August, will have 4x leverage effectively. Same with stock. Load up. The sept. 12 iPhone event will announce a super-cycle iPhone refresh, new form factor, 5G and other rumors. Likely to be well-received.

Edit: Apparently this is not understood by everyone. If you buy one 440c contract with October expiry today, on August 31st, your brokerage account will have 4 110c contracts with the same expiry."

* Tensions between the US and China are rising again after the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said Donald Trump will take action in coming days to tackle national security risks posed by TikTok and other Chinese software companies, as Microsoft revealed it was trying to buy TikTok’s parent company ByteDance.
* [The Sun newspaper reported](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12295304/boris-johnson-clashes-donald-trump-tiktok-london-hq/) today that ByteDance is preparing to move its headquarters from Beijing to London under a deal approved by the UK government, a move that would clearly upset Trump, who has considered banning TikTok in the US.
* Chinese state media said banning Tik Tok would be “a barbaric act of a rogue government”, and rejected the US’s claims about national security fears. A Global Times [editorial](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1196404.shtml), published on Sunday, said a Microsoft acquisition was “the hunting and looting of TikTok by the US government in conjunction with US high-tech companies”."

Was driving decently fast and saw a box somewhat in the center of the two lanes and a wooden 2x4 in my lane, which I ran over. Not having any plan driving I thought I would move the wood out of the road so no one else would drive over it. 

I make a u turn and pull over on the opposite side of the plank. I threw the wood on the shoulder and went to look at the box. Turned my phone light on and saw ""PLEASE HELP ME"" in red on the side. Instant chills as I turned and ran back to my car. 

After peeling out of that place I thought to check if someone snuck into my car while I was parked. I turn to look back then reach behind me and I bump into something right behind my seat. I never knew I could scream so loud. Turns out it was my seat I had folded down this morning and I forgot. I'm pretty sure my heart hit 1k bpm.

2020-08-03 06:18:52,ConsciousBox,5,"Several business communication software companies releasing earnings this week and next:

RingCentral (RNG) earnings Aug 3

Five9 (FIVN) earnings Aug 3

Avaya (AVYA) earnings Aug 10

There's probably others I'm missing. 

Another company in this space 8x8 (EGHT) just released earnings 7/31, their stock saw a 7% drop Friday. 

Ringcentral and Avaya have a partnership to provide Avaya Cloud Office, I'll be watching RingCentral earnings closely Monday to try to get a hint for how Avaya might do 8/10. 

My money's on Avaya, I got some $15 and $17.50 calls. They seem to offer the most wide range of solutions and their market cap to revenue is extremely low compared to everyone else in this market. Check the financials and market cap of all other companies offering voip/cloud/ucaas/ccaas and then check Avaya's. Their stock looks dirt cheap in the $12-$13 range."

Wholesalers called “Authorized Participants” (APs) will at times intervene in the market if the trading value of UVXY diverges too much from the IV value.  If UVXY is trading enough below the IV value they start buying large blocks of UVXY—which tends to drive the price up, and if it’s trading above they will short UVXY.  The APs have an agreement with ProShares that allows them to do these restorative maneuvers at a profit, so they are highly motivated to keep UVXY’s tracking in good shape."

With premiums being so juicy, Citigroup has to stay between $46 and $54 the day before expiration and I still make a profit."

Well with the incredible week AAPL just had and the news of the stock split, I did a little bit of investigative tinkering in Robinhood’s code and potentially found a new glitch. You’ll obviously need to have margin enabled and you’ll also need access to level 3 options which shouldn’t be an issue for most of you autists. Now, what I did was open 20 straddle contracts on AAPL 420s 8/28 and what you’ll notice is that within Robinhood’s margin recognition code, there’s a looping accounting error which has been active since nineteen ninety eight when The Undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."

2020-08-03 03:57:44,caseoftx,5,"For those expecting a Microsoft purchase of Tik-Tok US, consider this:

First, Bytedance has been floating the idea of a sale for weeks, meaning they believe it is to their advantage to do so. Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.

Divesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP’s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom & will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.

Main downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this & the sky didn't fall.

TLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP"

MSFT dropped from 51.48 to 46.63 Friday to Friday close, a loss of 10%. In turn, LNKD rocketed during the same time from 131.08 to 190.81, a gain of 45%.

Bearish 🩸: look for 323.19-322.85 to break down towards 322.09-321.09 area. I would scalp puts in between these two areas. If we do get down to those levels, expect some kangaroo action until next high volume push back up. If that support breaks, I can see us going down towards 318.95, which is very strong. Unload all puts. 

TLDR: Kang gang between: 322.85-323.97-325.13-326.92

Edit: Looking at 0dte 326-328p at open potentially."

>Several advisers were furious, and suggested that Peter Navarro, the top trade adviser who often has Mr. Trump’s ear, and other people in the president’s inner circle had helped short-circuit the president’s approval of a possible sale to Microsoft, according to White House officials and others close to the president.

Put many thoughts into this over the last months and came to the conclusion that, for young gamblers, aggressive investing should be key to fast portfolio growth.

Dividends (to replace regular income with passive income) don't matter if you have a job, imo it is always better to allocate your max leftover cash for buying aggressive stonks/ETF and gamble with a small amount for precious tenbaggers.

What I think people who are not in the Greek System need to understand is that partying isn't just something we do. It's ingrained into our lives. Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Greek system, partying became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary gatherings are for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state. People are giving us so much crap for it, yet they don't know what it's like for us to be deprived of everything that's fun for us."

Trump in a hardcore pissing match with China. 
Trump says he’s going to ban TikTok. 
Trump doesn’t ban TikTok because Microsoft is going to buy it. Trump comes out and says he opposed the deal. Microsoft starts to backpedal on deal. China wants TikTok sold to Microsoft. Trump wants to make China sweat a little to remind them who’s boss. The first big red day we have this week trump will announce that he’s talked with China, Microsoft, and TikTok and “some arrangements have been made” and he now supports the deal between Microsoft and TikTok. “This is a step forward with China” he will throw in at the end. Microsoft rallies causing the entire market to fucking moon. Im a fucking idiot but I think I have this one right. And I also own 0 Microsoft calls. But that will change tomorrow.

The judge enters the courtroom, and a silence falls over the room. When she sits, your counsel sits. But you remain standing. After shuffling some papers, she looks up and sees you waiting for a chance to speak. With a sigh, she groans, “Yes?”

You step forward, almost tripping on the pants hanging from your waist. “Judge, I know I’m to blame for what happened. And I can’t really repay my wife. But I beg of you not to take my kids. I want to see them grow. I want to help them grow.”

The judge glances at your soon-to-be ex-wife and barely withholds a laugh. “You pillaged the accounts you shared with your wife and bought 0DTE puts on Microsoft. You essentially shorted this courtroom, the institution I’m sworn to serve, and all of America. I will not give you what you seek. I grant your wife full custody of your children, and may God and Bill and Melinda Gates have mercy on your soul.”

She then bangs her gavel and steps down from her seat to film an impromptu TikTok with your wife and children. As they gyrate to the latest Taylor Swift single, the courtroom claps and cheers. The bailiff carries you out of the courtroom when you begin hysterically laughing and crying."

>The big picture: The Chinese Communist Party is pushing foreign companies to comply with the demands of its surveillance state, which goes against the values of privacy and free speech that U.S. tech companies have traditionally espoused.

>Zoom's primary dependence on China isn't a massive consumer base but rather its research and development team.

>Zoom has about 700 engineers in China and several China-based subsidiaries, according to the company's most recent [SEC filings](https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/09a01665-5f33-4007-8e90-de02219886aa).

2020-08-02 21:38:17,BiscuitRampage,10,"The delay on passing the next, presumably of many, stimulus packages...is going to make the market nervous.

Those of you who think the market doesn't react, aren't really looking at the market with any detail.

Let's use my favorite stock Genesco as an example.  At the beginning of the year it traded at $47.50.  Last Friday it closed at $15.50.   Take my bank stock, small cap.  It opened the year at $21.60.   Last Friday it closed at $13.08, which was about 3% above its 52-week low.

Any examination of the market shows that there are these huge array of stocks trading at lows - and tech stocks, trading as if virtual is our permanent new reality, thanks to COVID.

The market is not forward looking, it is 100% reacting to COVID.  Pharma and Tech benefit.  Energy sector, financial, retail are in the crapper.

Anyway this is to say, with the delay on passing the next stimulus, the already in the crapper stocks are going deeper in the crapper.  Then they'll get a slight bounce when stimulus passes.

If we ever do get a handle on corona, they are the rocketship...but anyone's guess when that'll ever happen."

A) Sell 1 month out $10 OTM calls on the stack. Use premium to buy further OTM Leaps.

B) Sell OTM Calls and use premium to sell debit put spreads.

C) Sell OTM Calls and just build cash for a dip.

Trump in a hardcore pissing match with China. 
Trump says he’s going to ban TikTok. 
Trump doesn’t ban TikTok because Microsoft is going to buy it. Trump comes out and says he opposed the deal. Microsoft starts to backpedal on deal. China wants TikTok sold to Microsoft. Trump wants to make China sweat a little to remind them who’s boss. The first big red day we have this week trump will announce that he’s talked with China, Microsoft, and TikTok and “some arrangements have been made” and he now supports the deal between Microsoft and TikTok. “This is a step forward with China” he will throw in at the end. Microsoft rallies causing the entire market to fucking moon. Im a fucking idiot but I think I have this one right. And I also own 0 Microsoft calls. But that will change tomorrow.

2020-08-02 20:25:11,garthybooks22,12,"I'm going to tell you guys a secret.

The market will grind further up, slowly ending up at like SPY 355-ish.

( 3 - year chart!) https://ibb.co/fFYQ9FG

The dip on the right is corona virus!

The reason is simple.

The big picture is this, We all know that the market has run up so fast because of computers and etc, and we know they want profit, so for them to all get profit there will be a nice ""correction"" or sell-off..

Now, the thing is this, WE ALL KNOW that when the market sells off, you just buy in!! so a Correction or Sell-off is an OPPORTUNITY of a LIFETIME, therefore there will be no big sell-off/correction unless a huge war, or some crazy news comes out again.

So, what you need to get out of this is this:

The market has completely recovered from Corona virus, I mean look, we are completely at where we dropped from 3 months ago.

( 3 year chart!) https://ibb.co/fFYQ9FG

So the way the market is going to screw everyone (if you haven't just bought shares and held since March of this year) is that the market will go higher up and higher up trying to scare people when there will be a ""sell-off"" and the ""market is too high"" and all this garbage scary noise the news and idiots here on WSB will try to say in posts over and over again..

SO the market will rise up even higher, why you ask? because the higher the market goes up, when the computers do sell-off for profits, it will only come down to a price that is still high for you to buy in at.

That is how they ""price in"" the whole sell-off/correction.

So say SPY is at $326, and it will end up towards October or so at $355 or it could be december or whenever, but when it reaches $355, then a sell-off will trigger on something, and the market will come down to $326! Which is still too high to buy! 

SO that is how they are doing this and why the market is going up and being pumped up so much.

They want it to be expensive when you buy even after a correction or sell off so you have to hold your money in the market longer.

Remember EVERYONE in the Market is there for ONE REASON: To make money!

AND to make money, SOMEONE has to lose, AND SOMEONE has to win.

So remember when the market props up higher and higher, and you ""feel"" it is ""too high"" and all time highs this and that, it means nothing, because the computers and insiders know what is going on, and they are taking the market higher so when it does have a ""correction"" you are still buying in at a high price.

It's like Tesla in a sense, anyone notice it went up to $1700/share and then down to $1400/share, and $1400/share is still WAY WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! 

So you aren't getting a ""discount"" from buying tesla at $1400/share  even though it was at $1700..

See what I mean?


SO what do you do with all of this?

Well, I will tell you, Buy the dips still, and do not buy puts, Only buy calls on dips on SPY and TQQQ. We still have to get near $355 on SPY before any major major sell-off.

Also elections are coming up.

and guess what the trade is??

VIX

When Vix hits anywhere near 20, you need to buy calls for 3 months out.. 

Wait for it to get near 20 first, then buy calls on Vix

so for now, calls only on SPY and TQQQ as APPLE will split and everyone will buy in because it will be cheaper.

SO the Nasdaq will continue up to 11700-12000 along with new electronics, 5G and etc..

You have your mission WSB, make money now."
