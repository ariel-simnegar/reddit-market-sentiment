Let me tell u what will happen 

The reason Disney is drifting is simple üòé Disney suspended stock buybacks to focus on paying debt for purchases. This allows shorts to play freely until earnings. The good news is Disney hasn‚Äôt split in a loooong time and only split after their stock hits 100, so expect stock split in the coming year and with the sale of studio for $2B they should announce another stock purchase program."

https://www.longtermtrends.net/stocks-vs-gold-comparison/

You‚Äôll notice gold goes up before the big fall as the bubble inflates, then falls with the market (people want cash, they don‚Äôt want to be in anything). Gold then tends to continue rising, which I also think it will do after it dips. I personally think gold will retest around 1,475 but Gold miners will outperform as this price move above 1,450 looks solid.

TL;DR think the market is going to crash? volatility is the way to go, not gold. Also gold miners > gold"

2019-10-29 21:48:44,Gaston44,8,"Oct. 29 (National Post) -- BEIJING - China will eliminate all restrictions on foreign investments not included in its self-styled ""negative lists,"" a vice commerce minister said on Tuesday, signaling upcoming directives.

It will also ""neither explicitly nor implicitly"" force foreign investors and foreign companies to transfer technologies, Wang Shouwen told a news conference in Beijing.

Such transfers have been a major source of tension between China and the United States, which have been embroiled in a trade war for over a year.

The 'negative lists' specify industries in which investors, foreign or domestic, are restricted or prohibited.

""We will move faster to open up the financial industry,"" said Wang, eliminating all restrictions on the scope of business for foreign banks, securities companies and fund managers.

Policies will also be fine-tuned to ensure foreign and domestic players have equal market access to manufacturing new-energy vehicles, he said.

The new measures are intended to ensure stable foreign investment and create a transparent, predictable investment environment, Wang said.

Chief U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators talked on the phone recently and will speak again soon, Geng Shuang, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman told a separate news conference. He did not give a timeframe.

U.S. President Donald Trump agreed this month to cancel an Oct. 15 increase in tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods as part of a tentative agreement on agricultural purchases, increased access to China's financial services markets, improved protections for intellectual property rights and a currency pact.

Leaders of the world's two biggest economies are working to agree on the text for a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement announced by Trump on Oct. 11. Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.

2019-10-29 21:21:00,JD_Harmeyer_I_Dunno,6,"MCD is the buy of the year. Change my mind. 

Down about 10% from the high in a very short time. It always bounces back. Same with Apple whenever there is a big dip. 

MCD is below 50 and 200 day MA. RSI is at an incredible low. 

Buy calls 12-18 months out and wait for the reversal. You can double or triple your money within months. 

You don‚Äôt get handed an opportunity like this very often."
