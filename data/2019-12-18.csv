2019-12-19 06:55:19,lagoupo,1,"Got a conspiracy theory that there is an acquirer that is getting ready to overtake Amarin (AMRN), so they are trying to drive down the share price to reduce the valuation of the company before making a move. Amarin just got approved for a one of a kind medicine that has a huge target market, yet the share price dropped after anouncing their FDA approval. There were only positive news, not a single bad one in the news. There has previously been talks about potential companies coming to buy Amarin but that they wouldn't do it before the FDA approval otherwise this would be a speculation on their part. Nobody has a medicine like Amarin yet. Anyway I believe, the share price is driven down because an acquisition is coming soon and they are probably in talk right now. If the share price was to drop now then this would give the advantage to the acquirer to drive down his acquisition price. Anyway, I'm staying balls deep in my position and riding the wave because I feel like there will soon be a jump in the price."
