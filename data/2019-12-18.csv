Amarin just got approved for a one of a kind medicine that has a huge target market, yet the share price dropped after anouncing their FDA approval. There were only positive news, not a single bad one in the news. There has previously been talks about potential companies coming to buy Amarin but that they wouldn't do it before the FDA approval otherwise this would be a speculation on their part. Nobody has a medicine like Amarin yet. Anyway I believe, the share price is driven down because an acquisition is coming soon and they are probably in talk right now. If the share price was to drop now then this would give the advantage to the acquirer to drive down his acquisition price. Anyway, I'm staying balls deep in my position and riding the wave because I feel like there will soon be a jump in the price."

Anyway according to him T mobile is the only carrier with the right freq bands for a decent 5G implementation.  All the others suffer from having to be closer and connectivity issues if you are moving and turn direction.  He was saying that the other carriers would have to lease t mobiles bands or even use of towers to improve their services.  Any of this sounds legit? One of the reasons I take him seriously is in March he got extremely mad that I didn't invest everything in AMD then cause he said it would be worth at least double within a year.

No update. We were flat again. [Same outlook as previous post for tomorrow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec1yob/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_18/fb8z5pc/) Resistance is 321.6, support is today's price: 319.5.

As we're nearing a support for current price action and technicals are approaching neutral on all readouts on the hourly, I expect some sort of movement tomorrow. In terms of directionality it is difficult to say. Two looming pieces of news are impeachment and weekly jobless claims. I expect impeachment to go through and jobless claims to miss projections, but whether the market responds/cares is a different story. Weekly jobless claims on Dec 12 missed and missed badly, but the market didn't give a single fuck. [If you viewed it from a technical standpoint we were right at a support level that day, and we mooned at open to maintain current bullish behavior.](https://imgur.com/ILUZM38) So it's hard to say what the market will do tomorrow.

We are in the exact same situation today in terms of technicals: [right at support, on the eve of jobless claims and impeachment decision.](https://imgur.com/etyZKKP) Given how bullish this market is I would be more inclined to believe we're going to hop up tomorrow, but if we trade flat or drop I expect media to associate it with the two pieces of news I outlined above.

Anyway, let's all just keep making those tendies tomorrow."

Slow to moderate growth and guess what reits, staples , boring bond like stocks and quality growth will be in like it has the whole cycle. My cci and Amt calls freaking printer today. I think reits have a lot of room especially if finance stocks go back to being average and volatility stays about where it‚Äôs at. Above average volatility is good for vnq. Flight to safety"

Buy a straddle on SPY, but with far OOTM options that are only a few cents. As long as SPY takes a swing in any direction by more than 1 percent, one of your options will at least triple in money while the other goes worthless. So you'll at least double your money.

Example:

1) Buy SPY $327 12/24 Call and SPY $298 12/24 PUT

2) SPY goes up to $323 in the next few trading days

3) Sell your call for a 300% gain and let the put expire worthless. 

You've lost 100% on the put, but gained 300% on the call, for a total 200% gain

Only risk is if SPY doesn't move enough or you can't sell the options"

My next epiphany has to do with Theta...  Selling credit spreads is the shit, now I watch the stock sit there and flounder and as the time goes on the cost of those options goes down which means I'm making money.  WTF??  This is a game changer, I wish someone had slapped me in the fucking dick and said try this 6 months ago.  Finally watching options go to zero is really fun.  I'm tired of losing on naked options, and this is sooo much better."

Would be a great time to go long on TSM especially since prices have been kept in check today due to impeachment uncertainty.
