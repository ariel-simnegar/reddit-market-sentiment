**1.)  If I believe in something, go for it.**  
I had DIS 133c that I bought when it was at 129 and I sold because I wanted to go theta.  Similar with WWE puts.  I know DIS is going up and I know WWE is shitting the bed.  Hold that shit.  


**2.) Don't Fucking Fomo/Yolo**  
  I made good money selling OTM Roku puts.  Why did I buy 125c?  Cuz apparently there are unusual amounts of buys there?   Why did I blow a day trade to make $7 on SPY?  Fuck that shit.  Have a plan and stick to it.  


**3.) Theta is king**  
  I've made a little money with calls and puts.  I've made more selling puts and calls on shit like ULTA.  It's fucking free money. For reals.  And call/put credit spreads similarly.  


**4.) Cash gang is a viable strategy**  
 Oh, you've got $150 that's not invested? Who gives a shit! Don't go looking for a fucking shitty option just because you've ""got the cash to spare"". That's real money that you're throwing away. You shit.  


**5.) Hi mom!**

2019-11-07 22:20:03,knotswag,23,"I totally missed today's intraday insane action, but here's **Magical Crayons TA.**

Since Friday of last week I've said we've been in a rising wedge pattern and we refuse to leave it. [Here's a screenshot of the chart thus far weekly to illustrate what I mean.](https://imgur.com/MSyThoE) Each time we've exited on a pop we've been unable to sustain and we've re-entered.

What does this mean? Again, unless we can break this pattern, signs generally suggest a correction is coming. This has been reflected in the volume patterns of the past month. It certainly may not be a large one, especially because sentiment thus far is blindingly bullish, it just suggests one should be coming. If you're a bull, you would prefer to see flat to slightly downward trading for tomorrow so the wedge can be cleared and the bull run to continue. So in general I still think that the market will lean that way tomorrow, especially with a long weekend coming up and bond market being closed on Monday. Popping upwards is also a possibility, though of course the concern is it gives you ample time to re-enter the wedge as we've done all this week.

Why would that be a concern? As I said earlier this week, after we cleared Tuesday nothing on the Forex calendar could shake the market-- that doesn't stand true for next week, where a few pieces of news, including JPow giving testimony, could make the market move in one way or another.

As you can see by the crayons, the lower end of support would be 305.2 tomorrow. If we stay between 309.5 and 308 tomorrow we will climbing the wedge pattern. We've missed the window to close our second most recent gap so I wouldn't be worrying about any drops to 304-- seems quite unlikely.

Best of luck to all of you tomorrow, see you then. And remember, do not GUH your portfolio."

Sold my SPY call to start the day in the tendies (up 50%)then scalped a put on the way down through the day and back into calls for the inevitable BS pajama gap up. Also squeezed in a KGC call that is even EOD and long dated so that will pay eventually. Is this what successful people feel like?"
