I think it's safe to speculate that he has graduated from Minecraft and has entered the autistic realm of fortnite. Unfortunately we can't bribe him with V-bucks but his BR squad is garbage. If we have a group of autistic individuals who can prove their worth to Barron, get squaded up with him, we can then start pulling sweet sweet insider info coming straight from the source that is Papa Trump.

There has been very little guidance about implementation and specifics about the technicalities of the process and how it affects these banks.

The divergence of Oil from the market, the incoming wave of commercial and residential defaults and delinquencies on mortages the market is vastly underestimating. 10 mill already unemployed and 18 million more in food/service/cashier jobs that are looking very unstable. Unemployment waves these next 2 weeks are gonna be wild, way too much for the offices to manage leading to more delays and complications with unemployment checks/deposits.

I'm in insurance - I think I should be okay but hope I'm not next. We're expecting a decrease in frequency of claims (less cars on the road, less people driving, less accidents. more people at home, less likelihood of spring basement flooding going unnoticed and fires etc.), which is good, but a large part of profit is from investment income on bonds and if those start defaulting.. yikes.

Just look at DXY if youre wanting to see perhaps how the markets will act the prior day, if it strengthens, a down day is more likely and if it weakens, an up day is more likely. 4/2 was the exception to this over Trump Fake Oil Cut Jawboning. 

During bull markets, DXY can affect equities from rising too much, but usually do not prevent continued rises. DXY dramtically surged from August 2014 until January 2015 from 79 to 95. This did not prevent the continuance of the bull market but stopped its momentum after December 2014. The 90s had a largely strengthening dollar from around 1995 until 9/11, but it did not hinder the largest bull market in history."

Futures started even around 6pm today and now are down 1.5%, so I'm going to say that the market is slightly negative all day tomorrow (\~1%) and takes another 1% dip at the end of the day as people don't want to hold into the weekend.

If today had finished on a downward streak, instead of shooting up, I would have predicted a bloody Friday, but now I'm not so sure. People still want in with this market. Regardless of what happens, I'm holding my puts into Monday, because I think the potential for bad news this weekend is very high. I'm only going to sell half my portfolio if we see a 3% or more drop in SPY before the end of the day. "

Stuff like Trump said something about oil that is good - BUY! Then stock goes up and they have a threshold I assume and then sell and rinse repeat?

Wouldn't these algo machines not give a shit about employment and sickness and more or less trying to trick the other algos to take their stock and leverage humans emotions to take their tendies?

Isn't that the end game for these algos to trick each other or outplay people? Or am I overthinking how they say a ton of the market is just these bots."

It hits on several ends. Lower disposable income means less spending across the board, especially on luxury products. If this continues without another stim bill, savings accounts and eventually, 401ks could be drained. And loans could be defaulted on. This is what the one eurodollar DD post was about. If people, especially those abroad, start defaulting on their loans, that hurts our banks a fucking lot. Those foreign loans are being used as collateral with our banks rn. And the fact remains that this isn’t going anywhere for many more months, likely at least until the end of summer. I’ve lost both my jobs and the unemployment # is rocketing. That # was pretty much covered up by oil talks today but such significant unemployment is not just going to allow markets to flourish. People won’t be buying the dip when strapped for cash and in such a volatile market. Disclaimer: I’m legally retarded."

It's a lot to explain, so you ought to read up on WHY it's significant for the most part. But this is no lie. SV is saying it, all the futures traders are saying it, frankly everyone who knows what they're talking about is saying it.

**If SPY sustains a price of 250+, we will enter a bull rally likely up to 270-290**

**If SPY sustains a price of <240, we will enter a bear rally, and drop down a new leg in the  220-230 with a downwards trajectory towards 190-200.**

If you want to argue agains this, feel free. But this is the truth. So don't root for X% up or down, **root for a sustained price channel**.

 Dear Business Client,  


Chase wants to help you get the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program emergency funds you may need to continue paying your employees and supporting your business.  


Financial institutions like ours are still awaiting guidance from the SBA and the U.S. Treasury. As a result, Chase will most likely not be able to start accepting applications on Friday, April 3rd, as we had hoped.  


***Make no mistake*** – we will help you, our customer, with getting access to these emergency funds. And we will make it as easy as possible for you to get these funds quickly. We hope to have the guidance we need from the government soon so that we can begin assisting you."

2020-04-03 01:03:46,LehmanParty,1,"D&B (PLAY) basically said they need some concessions, relief, longer payment terms, etc from their vendors, landlords and lenders, otherwise their ability to continue on based on the May shutdown is in question. They tapped out the rest of their credit line (statement said $500,000 (x1,000 so 500mm?), but the unaudited quarterly release said they max-drew and have $100 million left). My simple mind believes every day they don't get relief news is one step closer to them careening into bankruptcy, and while I don't believe it'll happen, every day they don't get relief adds risk to their chances. I'm thinking an $11/12 call credit spread, as many as your PRT allows, and each day it'll lower in value, but each day the chance of relief also shoots up, so between the profitable gamma decay/risk of bankruptcy vs chances their creditors loosen up their payment dates/covenants, the spread also gets more volatile as you hold it, so you hold it up also to your PRT. Full disclosure, I'm only going to do like $500 of these, but I was thinking of letting credit spreads bleed out instead of running straight puts because the IV is so high."

Tomorrow is April 3rd. Meaning, the non-farm payroll (NFP) report will be released -- a sobering indicator that will compound the current unemployment crisis. This report is intended to represent the total number of paid workers in the U.S. minus farm employees, government employees, private household employees and employees of nonprofit organizations.

The NFP report causes one of the largest, most consistent, rate movements of any news announcement in FOREX. Because of this, many analysts, traders, funds, investors, and speculators try to anticipate these figures along with the directional movement they will cause -- and all of that got thrown out of whack. With so many different parties watching and interpreting this report, even when figures come in line with estimates i.e. ""it's priced in bro"", it can still cause very large rate swings.

Tomorrow will be interesting and Monday will be bloody regardless."

Has the same thing happened with stocks?  Earnings aren't here yet, and who knows what the damage is to the companies traded, but have we silently, through ma and pop retail investors, indexes, fed pumping, etc., also changed the stock market to fiat stocks where my shares of SPY have nothing to do with the value of the underlying companies, and everything to do with the ""faith and credit"" of the good ole Ameri-cone dream?

However, March unemployment will not include all these recent jobless claims. You need to enroll which takes generally a week after your last paycheck which would be a week after you got laid off. Most states didn’t lay off non essential until last week. NY will the majority of additional percentage points. I do expect more so 4.2%. April’s unemployment will be the banger. Still I expect it to exceed these pussy little expectations. Did all the math, read up on what is included and based off what. 3.9-4.2%. April will be 5.9-6.3%

Its good for my commissions but bad for my puts because I'm starting to get the feeling that people think this is the bottom. Couple that with the fed and all the interference via stimulus packages around the world, and it may be true -- simply because people THINK it's true.

30% 1year+ option leaps on the same industries and keeping 20% for SPY monthly swing option plays. Current spy play I am going to do is SPY 260 4/29. 

This market is looking for any reason to pop off and the support between 240 and 250 has been strong. Last week we tested the Fibonacci level around 263 and bounced off it. This week we are testing the band in the mid 240s and if we bounce off this one I think we are headed to the moon. This week could be consolidation after a 20% bounce disguised as a bear trap."

Honestly I feel like the market may have a W recovery soon. fundamentally this shit should continue tanking with all this negative economic data but it seems to not matter. Google trends showing a lot more activity on “how to buy stocks” so people definitely trying to buy the dip lol. fed has acted much stronger than they did in 08, but we all know this. Seems like bullshit but i ain’t gonna miss the rally back to 300. And The stock market is trumps baby so he’ll try and do anything to keep it alive. I think I’m just gonna let my 5k in May 15 puts ride and just start buying up some leaps. And if they start buying ETF’s like they did in 08 I might as well not fight it.

2020-04-02 22:03:00,straightCrimpin,2,"This worked for me yesterday so I'm gonna do it again today.
Writing out my thoughts on where I think the market might be headed so I can read it in the morning before open and not doubt my vibe.

Thoughts - Today's close of $251.9 and intraday high of $252.69 were both above yesterday's high of $251.44. We also put in a higher low today, than yesterday, and this was despite coming of some incredibly grim employment numbers. The market is not only shaking off bad news, it's taking ""bad but not as bad as we thought"" news and running with it.

* If we: Gap above $253.50 - Expect early morning retest of support at $253.50, possibly as low as today's high at $252.69 before going higher. Target $256.22. Bullish.

* If we: Gap below $244. Expect a morning pop up to retest $244, possibly as high as $246 before going lower. Target $240, potentially as low as $234 if $240 breaks easily. Bearish

* If we: Open between $252.7 and $244. Just playing around in the range we've established since yesterday. Expect a retest of either support or resistance, follow the pre-market movement to determine. If trending down expect a pop up and then continue down, if trending up expect a pop down and then continue up. Bullish."

2020-04-02 21:39:00,ThePassionOfTheRice,6,"Chewy call highlights so far:

-2.9 million more customers year-over-year

-Two new distribution centers coming online this year, including a fully automated one.

-Will be hiring 6-10k new employees given increased demand, mostly in fulfillment centers

-They're pulling year-long guidance given the uncertainty of Covid19. 

-35% growth in Q4, 40% growth yoy

-69% of yearly revenue is from autoship orders, 47% increase

 -SG&A had a marginal increase in 2019 to 16.9% of net sales from 16.3% in 2018. They expect this to lower going forward.

-320 bps increase in gross margin yoy

-Expecting $1.5-1.52b in Q1 2020 revenue ($1.35b in Q4 2019)

-Increase is due to both existing customers and an big increase in new customers (no numbers given, but they've continued to see increases up until yesterday)

-May experience moderation of demand *post*-Covid due to customers stockpiling product

-No real impact to customer behavior due to any temporary shortages in product

-New customers are signing up for autoship at roughly the same rate as existing customers.


-Stock currently down about 3.3% AH. Glad I'm holding stock (I know, I know) instead of calls right now!"

Up to 10 million unemployment and one false tweet sends the market rocketing.  Combine that with the last big green candle on SPY that represents a 3.2 billion purchase.  F 

I completely agree with a lot of the TA that has indicated SPY going lower. But it feels like markets going lower is being combated more than the virus itself. 

So, unless something crazy happens I’m exiting most of my 4/17 puts at a loss.  Salvaging what I can.  And probably not re-enter a position until Monday.

Anyway, I'm going LONG Ford F, both calls and actual stock purchases.

Couple reasons:

1. Fords cut their dividend two weeks ago and they have closed plants, so all downside is already priced in.
2. Both long term calls and the actual stock is dirt cheap trading at 6x earnings.
3. Ford will not go broke, they pulled out as much cash as they could from their credit lines to weather the storm.
4. The FED is buying corporate junk bonds so all Ford has to do is sell more bonds and they get free money.
5. They make badass trucks, way cooler than anything Chevy or Dodge put out, lets be real Ford trucks are the standards.
6. A lot of people are short selling the stock so we will likely see a short squeeze in the next couple days.
7. They are retooling their plants to make medical supplies like Ventilators, etc.

Seems like every couple years there is a reminder that the Yellowstone Supervolcano is going to blow eventually and blanket half of the US in ash and plunge us into another ice age.

That got me wondering if the government has figured out how to trigger an eruption. The science is mostly about how to prevent an eruption but I imagine they have looked at the other side. If that is possible, I imagine a triggered volcanic eruption might be a valid option at the moment. Obviously, it would be devastating but it would further justify the government take over.

Things I have read suggest that overwhelmingly, the population is just too large to control in the manner they want. So, we need a mass disaster plus an escape plan for the elites who will be bunkered in DUMBs or possibly on yachts.

I’m giving serious consideration into making a prepper  portfolio comprised of SPY $25 Dec. 2021 puts now that the $24 premium is low.

Anyone else have insights/thoughts?"
