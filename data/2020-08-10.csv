The huge disparity between topline and bottom-line can be explained simply. Companies have gone on a dramatic cost-cutting initiative, far in excess of analyst expectations, that have significantly boosted bottom-line returns. Cost cutting is taking many forms, but two of the most obvious have been reductions in travel and lower rent, both of which are becoming permanent.


The dark side of good earnings: Companies are talking about turning ‚Äúfurloughs‚Äù into permanent layoffs.


It‚Äôs been a very strange earnings season.  Analysts dramatically underestimated earnings for a good part of the market, particularly industrials, financials, and many technology stocks. 


The good news is if and when the economy recovers and revenue growth returns, corporate profits will be even stronger.

The bad news is a lot of people are going to get laid off.
