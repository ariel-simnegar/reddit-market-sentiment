The huge disparity between topline and bottom-line can be explained simply. Companies have gone on a dramatic cost-cutting initiative, far in excess of analyst expectations, that have significantly boosted bottom-line returns. Cost cutting is taking many forms, but two of the most obvious have been reductions in travel and lower rent, both of which are becoming permanent.


The dark side of good earnings: Companies are talking about turning ‚Äúfurloughs‚Äù into permanent layoffs.


It‚Äôs been a very strange earnings season.  Analysts dramatically underestimated earnings for a good part of the market, particularly industrials, financials, and many technology stocks. 


The good news is if and when the economy recovers and revenue growth returns, corporate profits will be even stronger.

The bad news is a lot of people are going to get laid off.

If you bought leaps, you'll be fine. 

If you buy stock in amazon and it drops 3% do you go ""AH FUCK SELL IT, SELL IT""

No.

Chill out. 

USDollar is down 0.2% today so far and yields have dropped as well.

Trump and republicans WANT to pass a 1 trillion dollar stimulus.

Democrats want to pass a 3 trillion one

Joe biden wants to pass a 2 trillion dollar bill if he gets elected

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/10/stimulus-package-whats-next/#570d106662a2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/10/stimulus-package-whats-next/#570d106662a2)

Why does this affect silver? 

Because we will be printing fuck-loads of dollars. 

look at what happened in 2010 after the recession? 

Silver hit $49 an ounce.

It's been a decade since then and bond yields are low, dollars are being printed and there is MUCH more room to grow, price wise. 

The prices for silver predict $40 an ounce by EOY. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silver-price-daily-forecast-silver-stays-above-%2428.00-2020-08-10](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silver-price-daily-forecast-silver-stays-above-%2428.00-2020-08-10)

TL;DR

Republicans and democrats want to pass between 1 - 3 TRILLION dollars of additional stimulus. Demand for silver has gone up, the dollar has dropped 0.2% in the past couple hours, bond yields are low as fuck and with stock market uncertainty around the election Silver is likely to go up as well.

Don't yolo or buy 0DTE, buy leaps. Don't panic if we don't hit $40 by EOW or EOM, I think we will see 27 before we see 30."

2020-08-11 06:55:23,TheTigersAreNotReal,13,"For SLV gang: Don‚Äôt be concerned about these sudden drops. While in the short-term silver goes up and down due to buying and selling, long-term its a reaction to confidence in the dollar and  bond yields. 

With the massive QE and stimulus inciting inflation and the economy still struggling, the dollar will continue to drop. We‚Äôre not close to the bottom. The credit market is starting to tighten up as well, which will significantly hurt the economy and the dollar. And if this second stimulus gets passed, this will also just add on more problems for the dollar. 

Bond yields are expected to be capped, and this was mentioned by Trump in his EO. The MOVE index (Treasury VIX) is at an all-time low, indicating that bond prices will starting going up and that yields will drop further. 

Essentially silver will continue to rise, because the changes in the market will force money out of bonds and people will place it in silver and gold and equities. Yes it is being heavily manipulated by banks in an attempt to keep it down, but it‚Äôs an untenable fight. The fundamentals for this are very sound, but if you get shaken by a 4% drop then you won‚Äôt be there making tendies on your calls when it goes up another 50%."

S&P is going for an 8 fucking day green streak, which almost never happens, even in normal bull markets. I'm too lazy to go check the specific number, but I think 8 green days in a row has only happened 50-some-odd times in the entire history of the stock market. 

And it's happening when we're reaching ATHs in a recession.

I know I know. QE. Inflation. Etc etc. I get it. But still. All this green is what one would expect to happen before a bubble bursts, so it's a bit sketchy to go in big on calls/shares rn imo"

But i mean are a million people buying one share each going to move anything? After the split that would be less than 1/200th of daily volume total. If someone cant afford apple at $400 its not like they're going to buy more than one or two shares.

* Uber already had their ER and dumped as expected

* California law hurts Lyft a lot more b/c Lyft is North America only

* Uber has Eats and other revenues streams compared to LYFT so it looks like a better play for long rideshare players 

* Both still bleeding cash, covid or not, but Uber's way bigger and better positioned to borrow

Basically, LYFT should have terrible earnings and forecasts(fuck estimates or expected BS - these were cash furnaces without Covid). Uber is going to look much better as the dominant firm in the industry and maybe get a modest boost as a clear frontrunner.

You can construct a trade that caps the upside and downside like a normal spread, but if you construct that spread simultaneously the market balances it out and end up with a chance to win/lose that is proportional to the return on investment

but you can fuck with that by waiting to do the second leg until later, when the market has already moved and hopefully your long leg is now worth more

if it has moved enough you can make a spread that caps your downside at something that's still a win

Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.

As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.

Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.

At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.

Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of ~~a bailout~~ Stimulus.

I like to call this the ""local probability"". Now, let me introduce you to a new concept ""global probability"". I know it sounds radical but I'd like to propose that, in fact, when you take all factors into account (the global effects) the chance of something happening may not actually be 50/50. From this I conclude that stocks may actually not go either up or down but could go sideways as well."

‚ÄúWhere the risk is disproportionate is in technology,‚Äù the firm‚Äôs chief equity and derivatives strategist told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrading Nation‚Äù on Monday. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where our concerns start to bubble up.‚Äù

According to Emanuel, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are the most vulnerable.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a misalignment or a bubble, if you will, in the relative performance between top and bottom sectors,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe technology sector has outperformed energy by 78.2% [in the last year.] It‚Äôs really an astounding number.‚Äù

He‚Äôs concerned a pocket of bubbles in tech cold spark a 10% decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has hit all-time highs 35 times so far this year. It closed lower on Monday, but the Nasdaq is still just 1% from its record high.

How I blew up my account (awhile ago):

#1: SPY PUTS never bet against america folks, yes the game is rigged, yes theoretically the markets should reflect our economic turmoil. But it won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre not in The Big Short, stonks only go up over time.

#2 EARNINGS. Some of the best ways to play earnings are on the run up to the day of or through spreads. Don‚Äôt buy calls/puts the day of EA ,IV crush will absolutely kill you even if the market goes in your direction which honestly it probably won‚Äôt.

#3 FOMO: just because something is running up drastically during premarket doesn‚Äôt mean you need to hop on.

#4 revenge trading: it‚Äôs not a loss until you sell, I‚Äôve got hands softer then paper and i can attest to this, don‚Äôt jump ship the second you think things aren‚Äôt going your way then make 3 day trades to try and make up the loss. This is a recipe for a pdt restriction and even more losses.

#5 OTM/WEEKLIES: yes they‚Äôre cheap, they‚Äôre cheap for a reason, they will most likely expire worthless, know that you‚Äôre bassicly buying lotto tickets and if you do anyways then god speed, you belong here."

u have to have both diamond and paper hands for this to work tho.




step 1. buy a VXX put ‚Äî buy a weekly. it‚Äôs way more risky which means way more money üòé

step 1.5 buy the VXX put when it SPIKES in the morning. it will. it always does. u wanna buy at the top. good luck. just call the top.


step 2. at eod buy a VXX CALL just out of the money



step 3. the next day HOLD your put no matter what. it will print. SELL your VXX call in the daily spike. don‚Äôt fucking hold onto the VXX call you idiot ‚Äî literally the market has to crash for that shit to print. just sell it in the spike. that‚Äôs right. sell the VXX call in the spike.

step 4. buy another VXX put at the peak üòé


step 5. repeat



this is stupid risky but i‚Äôve made decent profits off it a couple times. i‚Äôve also lost retard amounts because i paper hand my vxx put. don‚Äôt do that. remember VXX go DOWN unless market CRASH. chances are wildly in your favor.

They were cool as fuck. After the storm got a little weaker, The husband put my bike on his bike rack on his pick up truck and we drove around looking for my friend, after we got in touch with him and met up with him and the guy took us home.

**Context -**

The S&P 500 increased 0.3% on Monday, rising for the seventh straight session. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4% amid relative weakness in the mega-caps.¬†

**Apple**¬†(**AAPL**¬†450.91, +6.46, +1.5%) was one of the few mega-caps that bucked the trend after Wedbush raised its price target on the stock to a Street-high of $515 from $475. 

The broader trend, though, was heavily in favor of beaten-down cyclical stocks like those within the energy (+3.1%) and industrials (+2.4%) sectors, which rose more than 2.0%. Communication services (-0.5%), information technology (-0.3%), and health care (-0.3%) lagged.¬†

**FedEx**¬†(**FDX**¬†199.98, +16.45, +9.0%), was upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform at Bernstein, and¬†**MGM Resorts**¬†(**MGM**¬†21.65, +2.62, +13.8%) after¬†**InterActiveCorp**¬†(**IAC**¬†131.27, -1.78, -1.3%) acquired a 12% stake in the company.

President Trump over the weekend signed¬†executive orders to extend $400/week in enhanced unemployment, provide student loan relief, prevent evictions, and defer payroll taxes. President Trump's orders will likely be challenged in the courts.

China said it will sanction 11 Americans, including several senators, for trying to undermine its authority over Hong Kong.¬†

House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin suggested they were open to a narrower deal through the end of the year.

The U.S. Dollar Index gained 0.2% to 93.58. WTI crude futures gained 1.9%, or $0.78, to $41.95/bbl.

In China most places **only** accept weChat as a way to pay for food, shopping, etc.

Not only does banning weChat really mess with the finances of American citizens who still have family in China, but you also completely cut off any communication outside of long distance calling between the US and China.

I‚Äôm not saying this justifies keeping weChat available, but it‚Äôs something to consider. I personally think Trump will be forced to walk back his threats against Tencent.

RH is just a gambling account, I had it 100% in CGC calls.

Well, that was a nice day, if I had exeucted my plan to roll CGC in RL calls, I'd be up even more.  Frankly I forgot to do it, till late in the day.  I still think RL is a good play.  It's just a retail stock that'll go up when stimulus is approved - I still think congress has to do it."

2020-08-10 20:17:46,PlasticRice,191,"**You know what the WSB Rites of Passage are? I think I've been able to chalk up pretty much every tier:**

**Bronze Level**

- Asking what basic things are instead of Googling them yourself, e.g. ""If I buy a call, does that mean it goes up?""

- Winning your first trade, suddenly getting euphoric that you're the next Michael Burry and bragging to all your friends

- ""Where do I check stock futures?""

**Silver Level**

- Making anywhere from 10 to 25% on your portfolio, all of your family members suddenly think you're a genius, and you excitedly tell all your friends about the ""strategies"" you learned

- Playing at least one meme stock at least once from Daily Threads, and winning on it out of pure luck but telling people you ""Did your DD"" meaning you got your DD from a guy in WSB comments

- Shove fingers up your asshole from being so euphoric about your geniusness after trading for 1 to 3 months

- Browse WSB on the daily, trading has become your new hobby, and Dad tells you ""Hey, you're pretty good..you could make a career out of this!""

- Friends tell you you're gambling, you tell them ""It's MORE than just gambling, it's--"" as you go on a pseduo-understanding rant of the markets who learned all his terminology from WSB

**Gold Level**

- Losing anywhere up to 99% of your portfolio

- Getting burned on Boeing, AAL, UAL, or any travel stock at least once

- Depression gang hits hard, always bargaining ""I KNEW I should have sold"" or ""WHY DIDN'T I BUY THIS INSTEAD""

- Use of WSB starts to decline as you dip down into a state of depression and acceptance that you've reached Stage 3, and you were a degenerate gambler all along

- ""Why is my brokerage calling me?"""
