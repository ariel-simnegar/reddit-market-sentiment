We were close to breaking the funky consolidation range we were in the past few days but had that massive selling off at the end to come back below the ranges. You can get a good idea what I'm saying when you [see a contrast of the daily and hourly charts here.](https://imgur.com/xry1OID) Because we've shown a strong break above that range however, watching price action tomorrow will help us get an idea of whether or not we can get back to the steady climb upwards the market has been showing the past few months or if we'll go back into this consolidation range of 319.5-324.8. 

The AH SPY action seemed to suggest we'll break back up, but with futures trading fairly flat right now, I'm still thinking we may continue this sort of flatish trading in the consolidation range outlined above. Momentum indicators still seem to suggest buying is slowing, but whether this is partly a product of the massive buying that had to sustain the % change in futures between yesterday and today will have to be seen. 

If we do break back above, the march would be towards 328.35 tomorrow.

See you guys then and get those tendies."

+ Buy ATM or ITM calls with minimum DTE. Buy when it dips. Sell when it moons. Rinse repeat (Is this called scalping? I think I know how to do this)

+ Sell Call Debit Spreads if you think stonk is going upsies - or Sell OTM Put Credit Spreads (sorry if this is the incorrect term) lower than current price and let it expire worthless (Tried this and found this to be safe but small gains for my positions)

It's just that the left-wing ""solution"" (communism/socialism) does not work, and ends up making everyone worse off. 

The fact is that most of us will be born a prole & die a prole. The only way out is to win big and join the capitalist class - i.e., get rich or die trying $$$$$$"

pay attention to these times (Eastern):

7:00p N225 opens
8:15p HSI futures open
