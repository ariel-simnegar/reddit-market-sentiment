2019-11-12 04:35:35,HowLongCanIMakeAName,3,"It was a cold and rainy night when I first stepped into the blue velvet lounge.

I didn‚Äôt normally stop into these sorts of clubs, but there was some *force* pulling me into this one, on this night. Something after a long day of work beckoned me into this dark and disgusting club.

I took my seat inside among the crowd and was greeted by the most gorgeous strippers I had ever seen, with perfect pink nipples and plump asses. All kinds of girls danced in various states of undress; some were unwrapped chocolate while others were covered with lace.

But as the next girl stepped out, I suddenly knew. I knew why I came here.

u/uninfinity slowly strutted across the stage, her perfect Ds bouncing freely, unrestrained and uncovered except for the exotic hot pink tassels on her nipples.

She grabbed the pole and looked around before finally  making eye contact with me. We locked eyes for what seemed like an eternity before she smirked and began dancing.

My eyes wandered across her tight body, from her toned legs, up to her perfectly shaved pussy with just enough labia exposed. Maybe it was the lighting, but I swear I saw a hint of grool dribble down her inner thigh. Her muscular stomach glistened with drops of sweat as her breasts bounced throughout her act, just wanting, just *waiting* to be suckled on. 

‚ÄúThank you for coming out tonight, I hope you all enjoyed the show,‚Äù she said before turning and walking backstage. I was stunned; I didn‚Äôt move a muscle for several minutes.

And that was the last time I saw her. I‚Äôve been back every night for two weeks now, and I haven‚Äôt caught a glimpse. 

And I wouldn‚Äôt see or hear her again, not until I dialed the sex line..."

If I buy a house in today's economy I'm still fucked for years. And everyone thinking the housing market will slow down, it hasn't and I've been watching for years. Houses in my area are worth an extra 4k each month. My portfolio cant even come close to that. Not even considering my future kids might have six figures of college debt (and to everyone saying it will work out, my parents said the same thing and I graduated with 50k owed).

Might just yolo it all anyways because if I cant be a multimillionaire I'm just doomed to a life of work and debt anyways. So what's the fucking point."

2019-11-11 22:11:54,knotswag,25,"Another day, another **Magical Crayons TA**.

No real news today. As I mentioned [last Friday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtdwpg/daily_discussion_thread_november_08_2019/f6xb3gu/) I predicted a flat ass day and that's what we got. The drop this morning was a prime opportunity to grab a few calls, [as I mentioned last night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/duhelx/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_11/f77gwzo/)

I'll be watching prices for tomorrow and early Wednesday. If we approach 310 with any conviction I will take a short position due to my expectations of volatility leading up to and after Thursday based on upcoming economic catalysts and resolution of the short-term wedge pattern, with an expectation of a minor correction to 307.5 ish. Otherwise I'll be on the sidelines. Crayons expect 309.5-310 before close of tomorrow if we follow the wedge.

We have a relatively high floor at 306.5, so if for some reason we hit near/around that mark, buying calls for a bounce back up is reasonable. In regards to trading action overall, a strong push past 310.5 or flat trading both bode well for signs of a more sustained run. However I don't expect large fluctuations before Thursday, with ranges between 309.8 and 307.25 tomorrow being what I'm expecting tomorrow.

Best of luck to everyone tomorrow and bless your tendies."

If you were stupid enough to buy index puts and you're somehow green, SELL

You're fighting against many things here, among them the fact that people's 401Ks and such are riding on the fact that the market only goes up long term

Most of the money I've lost has been from buying index puts. They're always profitable at some point in time, and then I F up by getting too greedy

These days, I just double down on calls and BTFD. Greed is less likely to kill me that way.

tl;dr; if you are greedy and stupid (probably most of you), just buy calls, puts are for smart people who know when to enter and sell"
