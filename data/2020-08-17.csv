2020-08-18 10:00:57,Coffeewin,8,"For those of you who can't afford TSLA single call options because they are so expensive, a smarter way to play the bullish move is to buy OTM debit call spreads. The benefit is that they have positive theta, are asymmetric in nature and have a positive skew. For instance the 8/28 2000/2050 call spread will cost you ~$700 with the max possible profit of ~$4300. You can still take advantage of the move by playing spreads instead of paying for a single call, say 8/28 $2000 which costs about $4800 (as of yesterday) with the downside of massive theta decay."

Big big green futures = big big red the next day

Big green futures = big red the next day with negative news, big green the next day with positive news.
 
Medium green futures = average green the next day.

Slightly green futures = flat day.

Flat futures = flat day.

Slightly red futures = flat to average Green Day.

Medium red futures = slightly red the next day

Big red futures = red the next day

Anyone ever heard of Craig Hemke? 

He claims that he keeps record of all the CFTC reports that get wiped off the internet and has this theory that JPMorgan has some odd 150million ounces of silver in their vault and has been manipulating the silver trade. (I don’t disagree but I’m just curious and skeptical of anyone that has a subscription website for “trading information”). I went to the CFTC website and it appears to hold information back to 2005?

https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalViewable/index.htm

So I was [watching](https://youtu.be/QHrNGmxLCpo) a conversation he was having. At approximately 19:54 in the video he pulls up his hand written notes and claims that there was a change in positions of “commercials adding 6300 longs and had to cover 8200 shorts”. If you pull up the August 4th report (https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/files/dea/cotarchives/2020/options/other_sof080420.htm) and scroll down to Silver, I can find the 6300 long position but I don’t see the shorts.. I might just be retarded so maybe you guys can help me out.

But my point is, all this information is here but he’s claiming he is the only one that has kept track of all this since 2011. I still like to listen to him talk about silver cause confirmation bias.. but does this make him lose a lot of credibility to you guys?"

**""CRMT:** America's Car-Mart reported FQ1 revenue growth of 9.3% Y/Y / yesterday and is trading up +6.82% after hours.

CRMT’s market cap is still relatively low with $718.67M (P/E: 13.37). This is likely signaling perceived value to retail investors and we’re expecting a post-earnings run-up. Short-term OTM calls at market open that could be flipped end of day might be a viable option."""

Market has to cycle sometime.""... now it's following that up with the slight March dip and the greatest recovery back to all time highs. I saw the other day Caterpillar had a 31% decline in revenue and yet is now above where they were in Feb before the flash crash. I'm starting to think a recession or crash isn't possible anymore. The government simply can't or won't let a 2008/9 happen without pouring/printing trillions of dollars directly into the market if they have to. The fear of the market going down is bigger than any deficit, budget, war, nuke out there. Fed will never let the market fail."

1. how do they expect to change the mindset of people who hate the ideas they have?
2. who the fuck is going to pay for it?  surely they aren't going to ""brrr"" this shit into existence, I'm thinking we're going to pay for it, and i'm not fucking down with that shit.  we pay plenty, they waste a fuck ton, and we've seen how shitty big biz is run, so those mother fuckers aren't going to pay for it.

but the sports subreddits put [Reddit Stream](https://reddit-stream.com/comments/auto) in their Game Threads since they have high comment activity.

Maybe we can have that too for our Daily Discussion Threads?

Basically you add it in the OP and if you click the link from the post it auto sends you to a scrolling version of the thread.

Although I can see a reason for not adding it since it is a third party site that requires you to pay to comment. But it's still nice to throw it on the second monitor and read the posts as they come in."

Based on the what the market has been doing in the past couple months (flash crashes and then going even higher afterwards), I'm gonna act like I can see the future.

I'm gonna take the graph of Nasdaq, and then add my own drawing to it. For example, I'm gonna draw the graph so we are at 11,600 on, I don't know, 9/4. Then, I'm gonna buy calls accordingly like I KNOW for sure that it's going to happen.

If we go down tomorrow or some shit and it's not looking likely, I just hold. I hold and hold because remember, ""9/4 is gonna be 11,600""!

I will literally draw my own bullshit graphs that are most likely going to come true (as long as they are bullish). You know how you always wish you can go to your past self and tell you what to do? This is a way of doing that. I'm gonna tell myself AAPL is 480 next week and buy whenever (not even have to wait for a dip).

**Before you say this is retarded, it would've fucking worked for the past 5 months. Watch and learn bitches, time to open up MS Paint. I'm creating reality.**"

-Bought a $1000 put contract

-Sold two $800 put contracts

-Bought a $600 put contract


Max lost is the original investment, $70. Max gain is if Tesla price falls to the middle strike, which would pay out $20,000.

I doubt it will pop, but if you're long on Tesla just do yourself a favor and set up a put spread as insurance in case it does. It's hella cheap and might save your account. Chances of it happening seem low though.

Edit: I chose these prices because I only had $70 to spare lmaooo. If you wanna put a couple hundo into an insurance plan, pick higher prices like $1400, $1200, and $1000!"

Now I'm resigned to just waiting until after the split to make a play because my gut tells me as soon as I FOMO into calls we'll see the inevitable pullback. It WILL pull back.

I've been closely following home builders since mid-July after reading an article about covid induced housing boom - people moving out of crowded cities, low interest rates, etc. Specific tickers in order of personal preference (cheap and volatile options, relatively easy to get in and out of a trade, etc): $LEN, $TOL, $NAIL, and $PHM. 

My observation:

1. Big up days are followed by a big down day ($LEN: \~3% move, $TOL: \~5% move)
2. 2 \~ 3 consecutive down/sideway days are followed by an up day ($LEN: \~1.5% move, $TOL: \~3%)

My strategy:

1. Buy a call at market close if big down day, I incorporate the % moves outlined above to determine strike price
2. Buy a put at market close if big up day
3. Buy a call at market close if 2 \~ 3 consecutive down/sideway days
4. Do not hold for more than a day

Caution:

1. Do not buy way OTM options, if price doesn't move your way there will be no bidders

* **DAL** @ 26.50 (just dirt cheap and less labor cost with upcoming quarter layoffs, probably gonna buy this with dilution)
* **XOM** @ $40 (oil expected to be up to $60 a barrel in 2025 & it's  also a commodity so I hedge off a lil from the ""inflation"" new is raving about.)
* **MDB** @ $200 (Is tech infrastructure and necessary no matter what because no company can easily just migrate Databases.

2020-08-17 21:45:39,noentic,7,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-17-2020

**Context -**

The S&P 500 increased 0.3% but came up short yet again of a record close. The Nasdaq Composite, closed at a new record high with a 1.0% gain. 

Investors leaned defensively amid perceived growth concerns attributed to increased U.S.-China tensions, a lack of progress in coronavirus relief talks, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 206.78, -4.18, -2.0%) reducing positions in several bank stocks. 

The S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.2%), real estate (+0.9%), information technology (+0.7%), and health care (+0.6%) sectors assumed today's leadership for their exposure to the mega-caps and stable businesses. 

Gold prices gained 2.4% to $1996.80/ozt, and longer-dated Treasuries saw an uptick in demand. 

The financials (-1.5%), energy (-0.6%), industrials (-0.5%), and utilities (-0.1%) sectors returned to their usual ways this year by closing in negative territory. 

Sentiment in the financial sector was pressured after a 13F filing revealed Berkshire Hathaway decreased positions in JPMorgan Chase (JPM 99.71, -2.70, -2.6%) and Wells Fargo (WFC 24.47, -0.83, -3.3%) in the second quarter. Notably, Berkshire added a new position in Barrick Gold (GOLD 30.13, +3.14, +11.6%).

In U.S.-China news, the U.S. further restricted Huawei's access to U.S. chip technology, and President Trump signed a second executive order requiring TikTok to divest its U.S. operations in 90 days. President Trump also suggested there could still be actions against other Chinese companies, including Alibaba (BABA 256.96, +2.99, +1.2%). 

In the mega-cap space, NVIDIA (NVDA 493.48, +30.92, +6.7%), Home Depot (HD 288.24, +7.69, +2.7%), and Walmart (WMT 135.60, +3.00, +2.3%) rallied to fresh all-time highs ahead of their earnings reports this week. Tesla (TSLA 1835.64, +184.93, +11.2%) also climbed to new highs with an 11% gain. 

U.S. Treasuries, as previously noted, had a decent outing, particularly on the longer-end of the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.15%, while the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 92.81. WTI crude futures gained 2.2%, or $0.89, to $42.94/bbl.

Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for July on Tuesday.
