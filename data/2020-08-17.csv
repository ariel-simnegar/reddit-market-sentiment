2020-08-18 10:00:57,Coffeewin,10,"For those of you who can't afford TSLA single call options because they are so expensive, a smarter way to play the bullish move is to buy OTM debit call spreads. The benefit is that they have positive theta, are asymmetric in nature and have a positive skew. For instance the 8/28 2000/2050 call spread will cost you ~$700 with the max possible profit of ~$4300. You can still take advantage of the move by playing spreads instead of paying for a single call, say 8/28 $2000 which costs about $4800 (as of yesterday) with the downside of massive theta decay."
