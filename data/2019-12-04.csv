This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal) to the preceding components."

* Rate cuts were just a routine midcycle adjustment. The economy is in a good place. Glass is more than half full.
* An inverted yield curve has always preceded a recession (with a lag), but this time is different. Forget that ever happened. In fact, it didn't happen. See the yield curve now? It's steepening. Didn't happen. Stop thinking about it, you're delusional.

2019-12-04 21:36:51,knotswag,36,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Today we had a counter-trend bounce, falling just in range of the the bear flag I talked about in [yesterday's DD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5fld1/daily_discussion_thread_december_03_2019/f9kpnd1/) In terms of momentum indicators, RSI, and the PPO, we're starting to trend towards neutral on the hourly and daily. This is not surprising I suppose because algos run the market, so we happen to be nearing a market inflection as we get closer to the trade deadline.

As I mentioned yesterday, I will be holding my puts potentially to EOW depending on continuing price action. Today's bump up wasn't outside of my expectations or projections, so I still feel okay-- previous counter-trend rallies on October had ~2% run ups regularly. Breaking the top of the bear flag (~311.8) with conviction or volume will be enough to make me sell, and that could be signaled by how the rest of the week turns out. However I think right now given that all signs are neutral, committing to a specific bull or bear position difficult. So whatever positions you're holding, it's probably a coin flip. Rest assured I'll be sitting with my asshole clenched with the rest of you.

So again: if you're a bull, seeing a break above 312 is a good sign. For a bear, seeing a re-test of 309.5, which was the initial price target I had for the pullback, is good as it suggests we could head again towards 307.3. 

Will have another magical crayons tomorrow, so hold on to your tendies as we continue the cycle of self-punishment and elation!"
