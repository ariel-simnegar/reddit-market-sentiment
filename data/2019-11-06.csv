But again, the market continues to buy every dip, and the news that December tariffs are still on the table were cancelled out by the potential for rollbacks. So much money on the sidelines wants to keep this thing propped so more buy in to a supposed Santa Rally and FOMO on the next leg up. 

The trade can has been kicked down the road a bit so I expect no major gaps soon besides the routine consolidation we’re seeing now, unless bigly news sends us one way or another. That should occur in the coming weeks, but perhaps not this week. Market seems to want to hover but not move higher as resistance seems only wanting us to create new ATH headlines but not breakout until more news of Phase 1 becomes a reality. I don’t expect futures to gap us up much further temporarily, in this range.

We could break down a bit, but that should only bounce us higher. Bulls should want a bit more of a pullback that holds SPY 302 to increase confidence that ATH-range has not been rejected.

Keep buying the dips to flip, but don’t go big unless we drop around that 302 range in the coming days, or even weeks. We’re in a holding pattern for now."

so, tos IS td ameritrade, yeah?  so as long as im using the same account, anything i do on one of these platforms will be reflected on the other platform.  right?  
  
so if thats the case, does anyone have a preference and their reason for it?  they both look nice and functional, although tos reminds me more of robinhood in its simplicity than td ameritrade does.  im a little too new to both of these platforms to recognize their strengths and weaknesses though.  anyone use one over the other to manage their account, and prefer it?  anyone just use both for different reasons?  am i an autist who should just stick to robinhood and accumulate infinity glitch margin?  i am curious to hear what you guys think.  discuss..  thanks in advance"
