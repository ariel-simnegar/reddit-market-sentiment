They have some pretty good non scammy courses. They‚Äôre more about selling premium and having defined risk, which in reality is how you make consistent money. It takes a larger portfolio to do that since a lot of those types of trades require margin, but it‚Äôs something to think about. Overall, I would focus on understanding investing more so that ‚Äútrading‚Äù. What we do in this sub is gambling lol. Which is fine if it‚Äôs fun money and you‚Äôre not blowing up your account. There are some really bad stories that have been posted here over the years."

>**Boeing Cancels Phantom Express Launch Vehicle 2 Years After Winning XS-1 Contract from DARPA**

>The XS-1 program was a DARPA project to develop a rapidly reusable launch vehicle which could also be used for hypersonic research. Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems were seen as the main contenders, but Boeing eventually won with a design based on the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine.
After 2 years working on the project Boeing stopped, essentially killing the project and leaving another hypersonic aircraft project unfinished.

TSLA 775c purchased at $3.75 at the beginning of the day.

Wanna cap gains?

Sell TSLA 777.5c at $34.1 durning the day.

But then so was thinking it was a nothing burger last week when I had calls. And the week before that when I thought AMZN would go up before earnings. And the week before that when ETSY hadn't had more than 1 down day in a row and I bought the dip but it kept dipping and never went up again. And the week before that when I fomoed into BYND at 130 and it dropped so fast the circuit breaker tripped and it stopped trading for 10 minutes.

Anyone want me to end the TSLA bull run? Venmo me enough money to buy a 2/20 TSLA call (strike price of your choosing), plus a 20% convenience fee. I guarentee the top will be in when I buy. Literally 105% chance that when I finally buy TSLA it will drop. Alternatively, I'll also accept money from TSLA bulls who would like to pay me to stay out of it. Highest offer wins."

2020-02-04 04:59:39,chadimmaculate,-14,"From the Bloomberg podcast OddLots episode [How an Exotic Investment Product Sold In Korea Could Create Havoc In The US Options Market](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/odd-lots/id1056200096?i=1000463128111)

**Host:** So Ben, you mentioned the S&P 500 just then in your example, and this is where we start to get into some of the newer developments in structured product land and something new that is happening is that we‚Äôre seeing more of these that are actually pegged to US indexes as opposed to sometimes obscure Asian equity markets. Why is that happening, and what does it actually mean for the wider market?

**Ben:** That‚Äôs right, so this has been a very interesting trend the last few years. First of all, to your point, there has been more and more of this underlying issuance directly linked to the S&P. Part of the reason for that is that option prices and implied volatilities on some of those international indexes have come down and down and down over the last few years. Partly driven by the selling of these types of products, and also partly driven by the fact that realized volatility globally has been falling, and most of the volatility episodes in equity markets over the last couple years have been US centric and S&P centric, so think of the February Vol blow-up and December 2018. These were really US centric events, and so from a historical perspective S&P volatility and option prices have been relatively higher and relatively firmer compared to international, which of course attracts mixing S&P to sell options to generate those higher coupons that the retail investor wants. Now, the other really important thing that‚Äôs been happening here: think of banks as the manufacturers of this industry, of this risk, where they‚Äôre generating this fixed revenue, and the price they‚Äôre effectively paying for it is the risk they‚Äôre taking in managing these portfolios. As we saw in 2015 in particular, it‚Äôs quite difficult to manage this risk in general, but especially in Chinese equity markets, in Japanese equity markets. These are smaller option indexes that don‚Äôt have as big of volumes where the structured products really dominate the risk in these markets, and where the liquidity issues are very exacerbated. So one thing banks really started to look at in earnest over this period was how can we get more of this risk into an easier to manage format, where we‚Äôre not having to frantically sell more options as markets go down for a little while and then frantically buy a whole bunch of them back in China, where it‚Äôs really hard to do this? So what they started to do was create relatively complicated investment products for hedge funds like Corridor Variance Spreads, which had the end goal and effective purpose of basically moving a bunch of this risk that they had to manufacture out of those smaller indexes globally and into the S&P 500, which is the worlds biggest, most liquid option market, and they do that in various complicated ways that we don‚Äôt need to get into. But the end effect is that even though they‚Äôve issued a lot of notes that are directly linked to the Euro stocks, to the Nikkei, when global equity markets go down, banks find most of the changes in their risk profile happening in the S&P, and it might be that initially as the markets start to drift down, they‚Äôre having to sell some downside S&P options, but then they‚Äôre going out and having to buy those S&P options then if the market crashes. So that‚Äôs very new over the last few years.

**Host:** So just to be clear, is it that the note in the basket of the indexes it‚Äôs exposed to has the S&P 500 in it, or is it simply a mix of that plus also the idea that even if the note is exposed to the Heng Seng or something like that, that the bank might find it still most expedient to hedge via S&P options on the premise that on some level there‚Äôs a level of correlation and even if it‚Äôs not the perfect hedge for them, it might be the cheapest, most liquid place to hedge their risk?"

2020-02-03 22:41:02,knotswag,32,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

The market bounced up today, closing on the button at 324 as predicted in one of the scenarios given in [the last magical crayons.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuvf8/weekend_discussion_thread_january_31_february_2/fg4oacw/) Because this price action followed TA exactly I would be ready to add puts tomorrow if we show signs of breaching 324, expecting us to drop to about 322.5ish minimum (320 still support). If you had switched to calls on Friday I hope you made good tendies.

NQ and ES, according to their crayons, both broke back into their earlier price channel yesterday overnight. Currently the crayons suggest that we will actually have some [sort of reaction up overnight, or at least test the bottom of the trend.](https://imgur.com/R7ewpon) Whether futures holds to give us a bounce in the actual market tomorrow is a different question. If you're a bear you want to see us break below those trendlines again. Because VIX is still in an upward trend and hasn't even reached halfway in its price channel, I think the correction is still ongoing.

Because we entered 324 from the top to close today, it could also mean we have another bounce in the market short-term. [If we do, then it should be capped approximately 326.9, which would test the correction trend.](https://imgur.com/6cqbgGw) Again, if we reach that zone I think puts are not a bad idea until we can break that downward trend.

So **tl;dr: don't buy the dip yet and watch your tendies bake carefully.**"
