2020-02-04 19:05:57,Raging_Red_Rocket,2,"I wouldn’t even say I’m an advanced trader, but all of my experience is YouTube/other courses and reading books. Check out tasty trade/tasty works. They have some pretty good non scammy courses. They’re more about selling premium and having defined risk, which in reality is how you make consistent money. It takes a larger portfolio to do that since a lot of those types of trades require margin, but it’s something to think about. Overall, I would focus on understanding investing more so that “trading”. What we do in this sub is gambling lol. Which is fine if it’s fun money and you’re not blowing up your account. There are some really bad stories that have been posted here over the years."

>**Boeing Cancels Phantom Express Launch Vehicle 2 Years After Winning XS-1 Contract from DARPA**

>The XS-1 program was a DARPA project to develop a rapidly reusable launch vehicle which could also be used for hypersonic research. Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems were seen as the main contenders, but Boeing eventually won with a design based on the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine.
After 2 years working on the project Boeing stopped, essentially killing the project and leaving another hypersonic aircraft project unfinished.

When you buy a naked contract and it goes up a large percent and you want to close out but dont have a day trade, what if you sold a contract a Strike higher and took the additional credit as profit.

Walkthrough:

TSLA 775c purchased at $3.75 at the beginning of the day.

Wanna cap gains?

Sell TSLA 777.5c at $34.1 durning the day.

now max loss is only $250 and the credit gained to you is 30.35 no matter what and all you gotta do is close out tomorrow."
