Well guess what poor boy, I got my Index and VR IS THE MOTHERFUCKING FUTURE. Anyone who uses this shit is going to know immediately it‚Äôs not a fad. Anyone who shit talks it seems to not realize that technology develops over time. 

Bunch of retarded ass Gen X‚Äôers saying ‚ÄúVR has been out forever and it sucks.‚Äù 

This shit doesn‚Äôt suck, this shit is legitimately mind blowing and the professional applications of it in 5-10 years time are obvious. 

Some dipshit here said to me it won‚Äôt ever be viable until there‚Äôs full haptic response and Omni-mills for walking. That dude is a fucking moron. Headsets are going to be under $700 and wireless within the next 5 years, guaranteed."
