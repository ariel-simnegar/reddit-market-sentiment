And then he exposes himself literally to girls in the dms and gets caught because he starts to feel a loss of control over Amazon and that blows a final fuse in his brain that triggers a psychological transformation that keeps all his fears at the forefront of his mind at all times like balls in a pinball machine.  He has to juggle all fears and compromise with them at every moment which distracts him from thinking about any tasks at hand he may have.  Then his biggest fear of all slips past the pins and sets off an avalanche of fears that destroy him.

1. Under $200 sold at $400 was happy with 100% profit

2. At $500 and got out at $850 again was happy because $850 seems incredibly expensive to me, how could it go up?

Feels bad missing out of this never ending rally (now $524 pre-market nearing 500bn market cap). Didn't want to FOMO because logically it is easier to go from $200 > $400 and $500 -> $850 than an equal percentage from $2600 -> $5200. At this point NO way am I going to be a bagholder, that would feel 100x worse than missing the rally. I cope by saying at least I made some profits off TSLA"

The company expects shipments of these next-generation iPhones to reach as high as 80 million units in 2020, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Apple is aiming to launch four new iPhone models next month with 5G wireless speeds, a different design and a wider choice of screen sizes, Bloomberg reported, adding lower-end phones are expected to be shipped sooner than the Pro devices.

2020-09-01 05:19:18,Soon2beonthestreet,9,"Quants:  If I take on a regional volatility spread trade, long NKY vs short SPX.  In 3-month variance swaps you see the spread 32 vs 28. In 3-month volatility swap you see it at 29 vs 24. 

Assuming SPX variance of 32 and volswap 29, NKY variance of 28 and volswap 24...  SPX moves -20% and implied variance goes up 63.4 points to 95.4. Let v\_w(spx) = sqrt(20 \^ 2 \* 252 \* 1 / 63 + 95.4 \^ 2 \* 62 / 63) = 102.78 be ""weighted variance"" for the spx swap. 

The SPX mark is (149.07 - 32 \^ 2)/ (2 \* 32) = 149.07 times vega notional.   NKY moves -10% and implied var goes up 26.7 points to 54.7; v\_w(nky) = 57.81, and the NKY mark is 45.7 times vega notional.  Loss on the spread is -103.4x vega. Size can be $193k. 

For the volswap spread, a similar calc gives weighted vols of 100.05 and 54.41, and the (linear) swap market values are 71.05 vs 30.10, for a loss of -40.95. Size can be $488k.

After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

There is an idea of me. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there."

A couple years later, silver went crazy and the spot price was at $48. I decided it was time to sell the bar. I went to the coin shop where I bought the bar of silver and asked to sell it to them. They said no thanks, they didn't have the cash and felt like the price was going to fall.

So naturally I thought calls on PTON, because Ten Speed is about a demonic possessed bicycle and PTON makes exercise bicycles.  But I started to think that maybe that's too easy.  Then I remembered that Ten Speed is also about killing a girl named Ambelina, which sounds suspiciously like Amblin, as in Amblin Entertainment, Spielberg's company that worked with Don Bluth on a number of animated films.  Bluth was the bitter enemy and greatest rival of his former company, Disney.  So who would want to kill Ambelina/Amblin?  Disney.  Calls on DIS.  Also calls on PTON."

2020-09-01 00:28:37,MP1182,117,"For all you guys trying to dig yourself out of a hole - don‚Äôt give up hope.  I hit a nice return on AMZN calls back in July.  Got my account over $20k from one move.  Not much compared to a lot of others but i was happy with it.  But i kept chasing AMZN thinking it was going to continue the run up to earnings which it didn‚Äôt.  Made some other dumb moves out of anger and frustration and shit.  Hit my low of $1100 back in the beginning of the month.  I slowed myself down.  Tried to be as patient as i could be and make ‚Äúsafer‚Äù bets.  Today i broke the $10k mark.  I‚Äôm still down but it‚Äôs moving.  

Slow yourself down.  You don‚Äôt always need to be in and out of trades all day long.  Sometimes you gotta just take that $100/$200 profit as a mental boost.  You‚Äôre not in competition with anyone else (i always had that mentality - seeing someone post a $60k win and I‚Äôm like fuck i need to get that too). Avoid 0DTE moves for a while.  Fuck, avoid weeklies.  I‚Äôve had positions down over 50% and i just held and they turned a profit a few days later.  Some were luck some were just that i had a feeling the stock was gonna come back and retest ath.  

If my retarded ass can turn $1100 into $10k in under a month most of you guys can do a lot better.

Edit - always try and keep some amount of cash ready to buy the dip or even average down if you have long dated positions.  I used to make the mistake of going all in.  Yes, it‚Äôs hard to have cash in reserve when you‚Äôre not playing with a lot and you might need to put it all in but as you start to climb keep some cash available."

Luke Housego

Payments giant Paypal has unveiled plans to compete in the US buy now, pay later sector.

In an announcement to shareholders released last night (AEST), Paypal detailed its ""Pay in 4"" instalments product.

""Pay in 4 is included in the merchant's existing PayPal pricing, so merchants don't pay any additional fees to enable it for their customers,"" the company said.

""Consumers pay no fees1 or interest, and payments are seamless with automatic repayments. Pay in 4 will also appear in the customer's PayPal wallet, so they can manage their payments in the PayPal app.""

Paypal's existing market presence and brand will provide the company with a springboard to compete with other BNPL providers in the US, including Afterpay and Sezzle.

""Afterpay has awoken the sleeping giant,"" said Swell Asset Management chief investment officer Lachlan Hughes.

""PayPal boasts 32 times as many users and significantly more data on those users. We expect PayPal to shake the ground of the payafter market.""

Swell Asset Management owns shares in Paypal.

Paypal already offers a series of payment and finance products in the US and other markets, which includes existing buy now, pay later services."

Amazon, Netflix, those type of companies. What's happening today is heavily impacting smaller companies, mom-and-pop type companies. These are the ones that are struggling, and so, since these big companies now have less competition from smaller companies, that benefits the stock market.

So to say, oh look, the stock market is booming, that means we have a strong economy. We don't. It is the weakness in the economy that is benefiting the stock market, and the weaker the economy gets, the better it's going to be for the stock market. Because what happens when the economy is weak? The Fed prints even more money, we get bigger stimulus. It does nothing for Main Street, it *sedates* Main Street, but it continues to pump air into the stock market bubble.

Basically bubble won't pop until 2022...."

2020-08-31 21:45:10,noentic,7,"Market and Options Summary for August 31st - 

Daily Synopsis

* Mega-cap tech powered the Nasdaq Composite to a 0.7% gain and to new record highs on Monday. The S&P 500 set an intraday record high but declined 0.2% amid relative weakness in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.0%.
* There was an absence of new macro developments, so the same tech-related stocks continued to set the winning pace at the expense of the cyclical stocks within the energy (-2.2%), materials (-1.5%), financials (-1.2%), and industrials (-1.2%) sectors. Declining issues outpaced advancing issues by more than a 2:1 margin at the NYSE.
* Apple (AAPL 129.04, +4.23, +3.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 498.32, +55.64, +12.6%) rose 3% and 12%, respectively, as investors continued to bid shares higher following their stock splits today. Amazon (AMZN 3450.96, +49.16, +1.5%) gained 1.5% after its drone delivery unit received FAA certification.
* AAPL and AMZN carried the S&P 500 information technology (+0.4%) and consumer discretionary (+0.2%) sectors into the green, but the health care (+0.3%) and utilities (+0.3%) sectors also put in a positive performance.
* Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index climbed 15.0% to 26.41, as investors assumed some protection against a possible downturn in equities. The popular view is that a modest correction could come in September after a strong two-month performance in the S&P 500. The benchmark index ended August with an impressive 7.0% gain.
* Separately, CNBC reported that a TikTok deal could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Front-runners Microsoft (MSFT 225.53, -3.38, -1.5%), Walmart (WMT 138.85, -1.45, -1.0%), and Oracle (ORCL 57.22, -0.66, -1.1%) declined at least 1.0% today.
* U.S. Treasuries saw modest gains amid the underlying weakness in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 92.19. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.35, to $42.62/bbl.
* Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for August and Construction Spending for July on Tuesday.

Then they beat earnings and moon, and now their p/e ratio is a downright ridiculous 1,800.

1,800.


It would take 1,800 FUCKING YEARS FOR ZOOM TO EARN THE MONEY THAT THEIR STOCK IS NOW WORTH.

Eighteen. Fucking. Hundred.


To put that into perspective, 1,800 years ago was the year fucking 220. The fucking Roman empire was in its infancy.

If zoom was founded in the fucking Roman empire by fucking King Alexander, it would've taken them until fucking *today* just to break even on what they were charging for their fucking stock, which presumably were chiseled into fucking stone.

That's how fucking overvalued zoom is, and yet it jumped another 17% in an hour because they best earnings by like 10% or some shit.

It is absolutely the most absurd stock in the history of the market, and it's hard to even conceptualize just how fucking retarded it is."
