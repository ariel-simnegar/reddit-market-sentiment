Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

**Untested infections suspected to be 44,000. China may not be lying, but lacking equipment to test at such a scale.**



[Current case report from China ups number from 2880 to 4474 in 24 hours. Deaths now past 100 with an additional 800 considered critial, still no deaths outside of China. Hubei saw cases double in a single day. This is expected to be more of a result of limited testing availability and not necessarily acceleration (blacklogging). Air quality in China is hypothesized to play a role as it is worse than smoking daily. Combine that with what is essentially advanced Pneumonia and the critical cases make up 20% of all infected.](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

I was looking at 600 calls, im seeing that tsla would need to end up around 608 for you to see profit on these calls if you bought eod.

So let's assume tsla does good tomorrow and pushed 565 to the limit like salt and peppa. And let's say tsla had an extremely conservative move after er. 8% upside. Welcome to 610. You're still in the money

Once tsla breaches 600 it'll take 600 beer deaths to stop the fomo.

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Once winnie the pooh realized he couldnt stop it the news came out. The numbers are likely suppressed since they sent 1000+ doctors and building 2 hospitals with 1000 beds each.

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

2020-01-27 22:55:30,knotswag,26,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

[We opened below](https://imgur.com/Sli69BC) a support level [I outlined last Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/etg465/weekend_discussion_thread_january_2426_2020/ffgobtl/). Because there was not even a chance for a battle at that price level, indicators now show that we're oversold. Normally I would say it's not a bad time to grab a few calls, but as opposed to the action we've had for the past few months where dips are bought, nobody stepped in today. This is, as I've stressed, a reflection of the impending volatility that's hitting this week with the the earnings of multiple FAAMG stocks and the Fed meeting. 

As you can see from the picture of the crayons above, now that we landed below my drawn support price action is trapped in a defined trading zone. Those ranges are 320-325.2. I regard 320 as a pretty strong support, so if we near it without bad news I think it's a good spot to play a short-term reversal if we get near it tomorrow. Whether you hold it overnight is a different story because AAPL releases after market close, so keeping it is not for the faint of heart.

If we break below 320 there are multiple clear supports that I will outline for people, but until then I expect us to stay in the above ranges. We're a long way away from a transition to a bearish market sentiment (need to fall below ~309), but with this week's volatility, do play carefully. If you like volatility and gambling however, this week is probably your week.

Best of luck to you all tomorrow and let's secure all the tendies."

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

&#x200B;

Here is my bullish thesis: 

\- Tomorrow, our boy JPow says something about how ""I dont envision any rate hikes for the next year"" and ""we may see one or two rate cuts if it seems necessary"". 

\- repo will happen again tomorrow, and will be extended for another month in february. 

\- we got our small correction, biggest one in 5 months. fair enough, but correction is over so long as JPow is going to keep up the dovishness over at the fed. big players will not be able to stay out of the market as long as there are tendies to be made. 

\- Bernie will lose IA. All the boomers who don't know who to vote for are just going to go to Biden. Considering the big D field, this will happen. Got a friend who runs campaigns in IA and he thinks the same. 

\- this virus seems to be plateauing. Sure, China might be full of it, but who cares. What matters is what the big headlines on Bloomberg say, not what is actually happening in Wuhan or on Whatsapp.
