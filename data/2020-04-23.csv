2020-04-23 20:39:05,fuzzyblankeet,1," Hello, friends

It's me, Fuzzy. This is to let you know that if you post **anything** political that doesn't relate **directly** to markets in this thread (or elsewhere on WSB) the comments and/or posts will be removed and you may receive a ban. Keep WSB clean of your [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) bullshit.

To the nerds and JV traders asking what constitutes political bullshit - use your noodle. If it's your opinion of the morals and/or ethics of what's going on, it's political bullshit. 

To the good, wrinkly-brained autists amongst you - if you see these, report them. I have a gap in my schedule for the next 60 minutes and I promise I will deal with them personally. Roast them in the comments (within reason). Do your bit to #MWSBGA

Love,

Fuzzy"
