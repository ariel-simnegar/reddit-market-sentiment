2020-04-23 20:39:05,fuzzyblankeet,1," Hello, friends

It's me, Fuzzy. This is to let you know that if you post **anything** political that doesn't relate **directly** to markets in this thread (or elsewhere on WSB) the comments and/or posts will be removed and you may receive a ban. Keep WSB clean of your [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) bullshit.

To the nerds and JV traders asking what constitutes political bullshit - use your noodle. If it's your opinion of the morals and/or ethics of what's going on, it's political bullshit. 

To the good, wrinkly-brained autists amongst you - if you see these, report them. I have a gap in my schedule for the next 60 minutes and I promise I will deal with them personally. Roast them in the comments (within reason). Do your bit to #MWSBGA

Love,

Fuzzy"

From the way things have been this week with ER and still no real market reflection with negative numbers, this is what I think is going down. At the hints of any breakthrough drug, the market goes crazy green, any failed drug brings the market down, easy correlation...duh right.. but then why hasn't the market continued to tank until a real breakthrough? The pumps, jpow, yea, definitely, but now it's slowing down. The market knew it was, the market is prepared for that, and now they're just preparing to get through earnings with as much money as possible. Would you rather sell off after bad earnings with a stock that's at $200 or $130? So instead of dumping earlier, they are dumping for earnings.

Now comes the big week, tech. So my play would be puts on AAPL and MFST, calls on SQQQ for 5/1 5/8. Apple is making a cheaper phone and bumping up their processors so I think their push is for more sales since they know that'll diminish and that'll probably come with pulling guidance.

That compares with the FactSet EPS consensus for 2020 of 38 cents and for 2021 of 57 cents. GE is expected to report first-quarter earnings on April 29.

To me it's looking like those loses are already priced in. GE is near it all time lows. Earning will be reported April 29.

2020-04-24 06:38:43,m77w,4,"IHS Markit **Week Ahead Economic Preview**

*Week of 27 April 2020*

**Content Summary:**

* The week ahead sees the US earnings season continue in full flow as well as GDP data for the US and Eurozone, accompanied by central bank policy meetings in the US, Eurozone and Japan. PMI data for China will also be eagerly anticipated.
* Policy meetings at the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be scrutinised for their views on the global economy and guidance on potential changes to the policy stance after key indicators showed alarming declines. Flash PMI surveys showed record rates of economic collapse in all major developed economies in April as a result of increasingly drastic measures taken by governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
* In the US, the FOMC has already held two unscheduled policy meetings in which emergency stimulus was announced, and analysts will be eager to see the response to the recent further deterioration in the data flow. First quarter GDP data will set the scene and are expected to show the economy already in decline.
* Similarly, preliminary first quarter GDP estimates for the euro area, including releases for France, Spain and Italy, are released in a week where the ECB policy meeting will be closely watched for signs that further mulled easing measures could be deployed. Several manufacturing PMIs and eurozone inflation data are also released.
* In Asia, eyes will focus on China and the April updates to manufacturing PMI surveys from Caixin and the NBS, with hopes pinned on better news after initial signs of the sector stabilising in March. Final manufacturing PMI data for Japan will also be closely watched as the central bank meets, albeit with little appetite seen for further stimulus just yet.
* The week also sees earnings updates from notable names such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Spotify, Tesla, Mastercard, Visa, Merck, Pfizer, Pepsi, Starbucks, McDonald’s, UPS, AMD, Caterpillar, Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
* Our special reports this week look at how escalating economic costs of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were highlighted by the latest flash PMI for the developed world (G4), as well as Australia’s debate on balancing economic and health costs amid falling new cases."

if it changes the math to a .5% death rate, instead of even 1%, let alone the 2 or 3, up to 5% worst case scenarios we all discussed, this means the market goes up right?

but it leaves open this barn door question, and i dont know, im an everyday idiot, but to me that question is what the fuck kind of situation is this where only .5% of those getting sick are dying, yet multiple people per nursing home, or work staff or what have you, are getting intubated?

how does .5% death rate equate to suddenly seeing 5% death rates in italy, or insane numbers postulated for china, how can thousands die every day and yet somehow, thats just .5%?

is it just its brand new, its the first .5 and its all up front, so it feels like a scary event? as time moves forward, they stagger and normalize to a small number on the regular like everything else?

does it still change everything permanently if that .5% is seemingly random and includes enough of the age range to justify eternal vigilance by every one, not just the elderly?

i know the answer is calls. its always calls. but what are the larger ramifications"

Any way we drop enough in the next 2 weeks I could recover to 30k or so with these hurting positions? I am not a smart man.

My total losses are a bit higher too than that screenshot tells. I closed some other retarded 5/1 spy puts for mega losses a few days ago and also closed some TSLA puts 4/24 a few days ago, both 90%+ losses..."

Never dip in more than 50% of portfolio.

Just because a stock goes up doesn't mean it's coming down and vice versa.

Take gains on the way up until you have enough that your remaining contracts are ""free"" then ride em to the heavens or let them die for a moot trade.

If you get nervous or weak hands take a break. 

Dont feel the need to jump in because you have capital. Make smart trades and trust that your right.

Lastly scrounge the comments for real dd from traders who make money. The memes are fun to follow but if you follow big money you'll swim in their wake.

They have the balance sheet to survive the COVID-19 outbreak. As for their smartphone business, it is still operating at around 70-80% capacity as their demand in India grows. Their phone business doesn't really make up the picture though. Even though it is \~60% of their revenue, their profit margin from it never exceeds 5%. With phone demand dwindling due to the corona virus, it could allow them to grow more profitable parts of their business, like their cloud services, which have a 66% profit margin. Demand for clod services has also skyrocketed with many workers working from home and xiaomi can supply this increase in demand. The have \~300 million MUI users as of late March. They are also leading in the Chinese 5G space with billions of dollars invested into this new technology.

2020-04-24 03:15:58,pilotsepisode,-2,"I think we should make our own market.

One free of rules.

Think of it as the AnarchoMarket

No rules. You are allowed to take peoples property or “shares” so long as you are physically or militarily capable enough to incapacitate them, or kill them.

The more people you kill, the richer you become, downside is, you have to spend your “shares” ,which will be digital “likes” on your instagram, to pay for security. Because people will try to kill you. The best thing to do is buy guns and aim that at someone, pulling the trigger  as many times a day as you can. This creates wealth.

But again, there are no rules here, so at any time, if the owner of the “new game” (which will be me) acquires enough guns and man power to kill you then you lose your “shares and have to start over again.

Bonus is everyone is stuck inside of a standard high school gymnasium for the next 5 years and must learn how to survive here. There is only the concession “food” that was there prior, which is significantly limited.

I am writing a letter to Jerome Powell tonight to see if we can make this happen, and trust me, Jerome likes me a lot, and he’ll do what I say.

Something as simple as improving railroad infrastructure to the drop off point could make a big difference, as it would be possible to load the oil into rail cars faster, GREATLY increasing storage capacity. Each car can fit about 700 barrels. 

The reason for negative rates was a storage issue. If storage options are expanded, the likelihood of a repeat of May futures is much less likely.

Then we’ll gradually go up until lunch.

At that time, we will moon like no one has seen before, probably Spy 288. 

Bears and those ex bulls will sell their poots for a loss so they can fomo calls. 

Hour before close the market will drop, a lot, not huge but enough for that one last imma average down my calls for sure.

At that point I will feel like getting some ROPE because I would have been up like 38 grand, but instead I am only up like 3, putting me still negative for the week. Then I will throw that cash back into TWTR, thinking I can play it the opposite direction, and play both sides. I will the. Start to actually LOSE money yet, because I could not stick with the original intent of my trade. So not only will I lose $, I will be totally pissed because I didn’t stick with my plan at all.

Today I picked up some spy puts for both June 30th and July 17th with a $260 strike price. I am not going to elaborate on the fundamentals, but we all know the 'ol bat flu is far from over. On Tuesday, we broke below the bottom channel of resistance around $274, by my analysis, this is a ""sell"" on the daily. On the hourly chart, today we closed with two red candles for lower lows and lower highs, also suggesting short. This is a moderate to conservative options play, as there are about 2-3 months for expiry, and about 7% out of the money. My plan is to sell the June contracts in approximately one months time, or if we hit $244 SPY, whichever comes first. For the July expiry, I will sell at $244, or two months time, whichever occurs first. This bull rally has mimicked most other aggressive sell-offs in the market, and I would say it is healthy. But with how long it will take economy to fully recover, I believe market is still overpriced, and therefore should sell off in the future, much like other bull-runs have following sharp declines.

Check out their financials. They lose so much money that they have to borrow in order to pay their employees. Download their prospectus form and ctrl+F “net income” or “profit”.

> Shorts are still circling the wagons, Dusaniwsky said in an analysis  published Thursday. Over the past week, an additional 6.50 million  shares, or 10.9% of shares outstanding, have been shorted, even as it’s  starting to cost those traders more to borrow shares.  “While demand is pushing stock borrowing fees up, USO’s $3.7 billion  market cap will tamper the borrow side rate pressure as lenders begin to  undercut each other to get their shares out the door in order to earn  lending fees,” he added.

Instead of buying an S&P500 fund why don’t you all just short the spxs long term?

The only reason why people don’t buy leveraged indexes long term is because they go down over time because leverage math. The spxs goes down by 3% whenever the S&P 500 goes up by 1%. The SP500 goes up by 10% on average per year. Logically the SPXS would go down by 30% per year on average. Therefore it would make sense to short the spxs long term. Is there anything wrong with this logic?
Also yes I know you guys think buying and holding is gay just ignore that this time."
