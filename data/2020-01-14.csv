2020-01-15 06:07:51,apismal,15,"I was 22 years old when I learned that not every family has a poop knife.

My family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.

Growing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out ""hey, can you get me the poop knife""?

I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.

Fast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.

""My what?""

Your poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.

""Wtf is a poop knife?""

Obviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.

He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.

I told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.

She will be getting her own utility knife now.

[Edit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.]"

Tesla is $95B with 30B in revenue, the greatest/ most cutting edge tech on earth, cash flow positive, probably the most valuable brand and can easily surpass the growth of Netflix.

&#x200B;

So there is a FED model which basically says whether the market is undervalued or overvalued. Its overvalued if the SPY earnings yield is lower than 10 yr trasury bonds and its undervalued if the yield is higher than 10 yr treasury yield.

&#x200B;

Doing a minute search I found out that spy is very undervalued based on the FED model as its earnings yield is about 4.6% whereas US trasuries yield around 1.835%.

&#x200B;

Calls it is, the market is undervalued, there is no alternative risk adjusted investments that would come close to equities. Or in our case FDs on equities."

There was a guy named Jay Welker, but he somehow got MeToo'd into retirement because some women complained. Then there was a guy named Dean Junkans, but he, too, retired.

That left us with David Kowach, running ""WELLS FARGO ADVISORS"" with 1.6T or 1.9T in AUM. But then I hear that he is also gone, moved over to ""community banking"" instead and leaving a guy named JIM HAYS in charge. To top it all off there are CIO types named Erik Davidson and Jonathan Weiss, and god only knows what they do.

2020-01-14 21:36:57,oregon_forever,11,"Last week I sold a very wide TSLA strangle position. Puts at $400 and calls at $600 expiring this Friday. The stock's price at the time was $480 so the stock would have to either drop $80 or rise $120 in one week for me to lose money which is unlikely. On Monday the stock was up $50 and today another $13. Even though it's still well within my range ($437) and there is only 3 days til expiration, my account lost $3000 because apparently Tesla literally doesn't have theta decay until 3:59 pm on Friday of expiration and IV keeps rising every day.

Now I rolled my position to next Friday. Shit expires in 10 days (7 trading days) and my range is from $400 to $650. Tesla's earnings report isn't until 29th so I'm safe from that at least. Stock would have to rise $120 or drop $140 for me to lose money. I have a feeling that this will somehow get fucked up too like IV will double, stock will jump to $700 overnight on retard strength or something. We'll see.

Edit: It turns out that Tesla's earnings release is not necessarily on the 29th. They didn't say when they will release their earnings which means it could be any day. This also explains why IV on TSLA options were so high. For example if Tesla says that they will announce earnings on the 29th, IV on earlier options will crash."

[Yesterday's prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eo2pe0/daily_discussion_thread_january_13_2020/feaj0ox/) turned out fairly accurately, as we traded around, and closed below, the trendline as projected. Early earnings from the banks have shown strength suggesting that the others will do neutral to good, and without other huge economic news tomorrow, it seems we're just waiting to see whether the trade deal is signed, and if it does, what's in it.

So as of now the lines are still the ranges are similar to today-- 324.8 is the support, 328.4 is the resistance. If the trade deal is signed and it's good, I expect we'll start to march past the resistance given that earnings thus far haven't shown much to be concerned about. If the trade deal is trash or not signed, again, look for price action to head towards 324.8. I expect that if the news is bad to hold onto your asses because the Fed has not announced plans to roll their repos [further out past the 17th,](https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/rapo%20maturities_0.jpg?itok=7fCiRTPR) from the news I've seen.
