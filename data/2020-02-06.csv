Factory shutdowns are likely to become the ""contagion"" which spreads inter-regionally, limiting GDP forecast. This reduction in GDP estimates has significant potential to make financial institutions less likely to loan, and more likely to hoard cash for their own security. This insult to the credit market will reduce the flow of capital through the system, resulting in systemic recession.

What happens when the next recession hits? We've spent 12 fucking years at the lowest interest rates in history. We're effectively in QE4... What pulls us out of the next dip?

I'm calling it now. If the top isn't already in, it will be in the next 6 weeks.

[As I mentioned yesterday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezgfp6/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_06/fgniqxm/) resistance was at 334 and [we tested it fucking perfectly.](https://imgur.com/o3Jci1m) 

There are obviously three ways tomorrow can go-- upsies, downsies, or consolidation. Unfortunately the charts are not very clear on where we might go, but the latter two (downsies/consolidaton) are the more likely scenarios. VIX is testing its support on the [fucking button.](https://imgur.com/8MEaBZz) With unemployment news coming out tomorrow and us being at historical lows, there's actually not much wiggle room for ""improvement"" per se. So if we miss I expect VIX and SPY to both react appropriately and ""confirm"" the crayons by having a leap up in VIX/retraction in the SPY respectively.

In terms of consolidation, tomorrow's resistance for SPY is 335.2. So a slow creep up is also possible if we meet expectations.

If there's some other piece of new Gyna news that is good, we could be pushed up as well. If we gap up past 335.2, the next resistance level is 337.6.

Good luck to everyone tomorrow and count your tendies to make sure the mods haven't taken any."
