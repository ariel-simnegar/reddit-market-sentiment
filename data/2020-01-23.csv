Interesting if you can read Chinese. They are downplaying the severity of the issue for sure and estimating more than 6000 are affected. Keep in mind the alert level has been raised from level 4 to level 1 which is considered a national emergency. 14 cities are on a hard lockdown totaling over 36 million people. And you really believe only 900 are infected? They are already constructing a hospital with an ETA of 6 days (it was 8 days for SARS). Why would they need to if it wasn't so serious 🤔 This will definitely affect many tendies as flights from Wuhan landed all around the world including Hong Kong and Paris. Subsequent flights to NYC, LA, GTA and VAN.

That being said. Some of you young bucks need to listen to bands like Dead Kennedy’s.

SPY broke briefly [beneath the trendline of the hourly charts but rallied to close above EOD](https://imgur.com/fmHTov7), maintaining our current bullish trajectory. With INTC beating projections handily, I'm reasonably confident we're going to stay in bullish ranges tomorrow and be green. Ranges tomorrow are 331.1-335.1.

2020-01-23 21:06:48,vercrazy,4,"Guys, my brother accidentally drank a Coronita—is he going to die from the beerflu or was it only regular Coronas that were infected?

Also why did Mexico poison China with their alcohol? Were they jealous that Trump gave them a deal on their own, and they had to share one with Canada? Or are the rumors true that this is a false flag operation from Anheuser-Busch to move more people over to Budlight Seltzer?

My doctor said to stop calling him when I asked him the same questions, so I think Big Pharma also might be paying the medical community off to keep the truth from coming out."
