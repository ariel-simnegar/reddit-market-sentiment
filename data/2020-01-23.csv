2020-01-24 10:03:51,hamsupjai,7,"Dam Chinamen appears to be tired of censorship. Banding together on WhatsApp and WeChat to try and release actual numbers of infected. Interesting if you can read Chinese. They are downplaying the severity of the issue for sure and estimating more than 6000 are affected. Keep in mind the alert level has been raised from level 4 to level 1 which is considered a national emergency. 14 cities are on a hard lockdown totaling over 36 million people. And you really believe only 900 are infected? They are already constructing a hospital with an ETA of 6 days (it was 8 days for SARS). Why would they need to if it wasn't so serious 🤔 This will definitely affect many tendies as flights from Wuhan landed all around the world including Hong Kong and Paris. Subsequent flights to NYC, LA, GTA and VAN. 


On a serious note though, all in NFLX calls for the inevitable Corona Virus documentary. I can already see the guy sighing and saying ""it was just too late. we were too late to react. and so many lives were lost"""
