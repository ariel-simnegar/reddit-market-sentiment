Have some questions about credit spreads onn Robinhood:

1. When closing a call credit spread that is currently OTM/profitable, how do I know what my profit will be? Robinhood shows the max cost and collateral value.
2. Would the profit be the credited amount, minus the max cost?
3. Also is the collateral shown the amount of account collateral used to open the trade, and does it get credited back to the account?
4. Is there any advantage to holding the spread to expiration if everything is out of the money?

Bailouts aren‚Äôt pallets of cash like the bailouts of past administrations. They are loans. Loans with very strict guidelines that must be repaid with either cash or stock. 

Think large scale nationalization of the airlines. 

The most damaging of all the provisions in my opinion is the indefinite halt of dividends to stock holders. 

Do you realize how quickly money managers and boomers are going to dump these pigs once they realize they aren‚Äôt paying dividends any longer?

Airlines are absolutely fucked.

>People of all ages are at risk of infection, not just older adults.

>Of the first 50 local cases, only 20 are 60 to 80. The youngest patient is somewhere between the ages of 15-25. Four others are in their 20s. Five in their 30s. Thirteen in their 40s. Eight in their 50s.

Edit: I will go as far OTM as I can while also having the ability to sell before close. $280 was a bad example. My B my B

Edit: Boys, the risk is purposely buying farther OTM so after pump they're ITM. I'm pretty damn sure I could sell it late when they're ITM. And if it doesn't work out? Idk, haven't thought that far cause I'm autistic I think

LAST EDIT: I'll do 3/27 instead of 3/20. Makes zero sense to do 3/20 and TIL I am in fact, retarded. I will hold it for 10mins, make 420.69% profit, and cash out. Thank you"

All of my coworkers are telling me to break up with her. But whenever I pick myself up to talk to her about it, I just can't help myself to think about that she may ended up living in the street without me paying all the bills, and that'll be the end of that conversation.

Edit. By continue I mean a full blown shut down but markets are open

Edit2. Reason I ask is last 4 times we‚Äôve shut down the market for multiple days, it opened higher 3 times

My answer. If it is timed right, we give ourself time to get our shit together when we see the peak of infected, deal with the packed hospitals, and then open back up when shit has ‚Äúcalmed down‚Äù. I think if we let it ride we‚Äôd see another 50% drop"

Futures went red, then mooned with low volume, then spent the better part of 6 hours zig zagging all the way down. 

All the bulls celebrated early. All the bears humbly panic posted about losses, then acceptance (because they‚Äôre still making bank every other day of the week). On the way down bulls yelled about algos and mm‚Äôs. At the bottom bears flipped and went back to leave some ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äôs‚Äù on older comments. We were red, smart bears dumped. Greedy bears held. We had a nice run up early in the morning. Bulls celebrated early. Went down. Smart bears bought at the top and sold. Even greedy bulls sold. Retards held. As we began to reach what was the all time low of the day, we run so far and fast on a green roller coaster. Bears get fucked. Bulls celebrated early. 

Monday bulls went into hiding because of the absolute severity of how badly they got BTFO. WSB had its least retarded day.

Patients that have 'recovered' will continue spreading it long after they are no longer showing symptoms. The virus is just hiding in their body just waiting to be released to some unsuspecting victim
Testing is only 50% accurate, so about half the people who have been tested and shown to be negative are actually positive
Virus can live for days on hard surfaces
People can be carriers who never get sick, and show no symptoms whatsoever.
Virus can reappear and start attacking again after patient has already 'recovered'

None of my other contracts were green, and buying those two puts tied up all my money. Didn't get to cash in on the pump that many stocks got.

2020-03-20 04:22:03,27onfire,22,"To all the people who cannot understand the numerous kernels of wisdom, advice, research, and other priceless information that lies within this sub and continue to ask about things like..  

1. How do SPY calls work?  

2. What is the difference between calls and puts?  

3. How do I close a contract?  

4. What is the difference between buying and selling calls?  

5. What is the witching hour?  

6. Why am I a 33 year old virgin?  

Here is how I remember the answer to these (and many other) WSB/trading relating questions:  

**G.I.R.L.**. 

This stands for:  

G - Google 

I - It 
   
R - Retard

L - Loser 

Yes the last 2 steps are repetitive, but I really think it helps drive home the message, i.e., You are a retarded loser that has the access to all of humankind's collective info, but you're too stupid to actually use it.

If crude prices hold today and no more ""unexpected"" bad news (i.e holy shit 50k people just got confirmed with wuflu), today may see a massive put option gamma hedge (big green boner). 234 still key support (2018 lows) and 247 is resistance 1, 256 is resistance 2.

As you can see, the JNUG is mainly a hedge for this being ""the bottom"", as the vast majority of my other positions are puts against SPY and UNH. 

At this point, whether we go up or down, I'm a happy camper."

Next they will call in 1st responders. He said they are preparing to announce a nationwide 1 week quarantine for all citizens, All businesses closed. Everyone at home. They were told to pack and be prepared for up to 30 days deployment which he said means they may extend the quarantine up to 30 days. He told me to notify our family members and have them stock up and be prepared.  They will announce this as soon as they have troops in place to help prevent looters and rioters... he said he got the call last night and was told to pack and be prepared for the call today with his dispatch orders. He thinks they will announce before the end of the weekend to keep people home on Monday.

 And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. 

I stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. 

Yeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one.

1. Coronavirus treatment announced effective and being dispersed immediately.

2. All companies back up and running at full force.

3. OPEC sorts their shit out, and decides to shut down production, giving full global drilling rights and selling power to the United States to provide the world's supply of oil.

4. China cedes control of all of its labor to the American private sector so manufacturing may continue at full speed (and cheap). 

5. Elon Musk invents a teleporter that can take you from Earth to Mars instantly, and on Mars he finds the cure for cancer in a rock.

6. You receive an email saying ""sell all your calls by 3:30PM today and buy puts on everything. EVERYTHING. Love, You, from the future""


Sunday:

1. Trump claims to never have said any of that and doesn't know what the fake news is talking about. He's never heard of Corona-Virus before, and doesn't even know what a Mellon Tusk is or what it's doing on Mars.

2020-03-20 01:52:45,Endura_GW2,20,"Quick DD on Lyft:

Big up today because of the Uber pump. Uber said they have enough cash on hand to get through about a year with significantly decreased revenue of about 80% overall (worst case scenario). However, they are seeing a huge increase in their food delivery service segment. Ok Uber, makes sense so far. Just two days ago both Uber and Lyft announced pool rides would be removed as an option. Makes sense, don't want to be right next to someone and spread the virus. Ok, so is the driver immune to catching it? lol. Anyway...

Lyft Cash on hand as of 12/31/2019: $358 million

Uber Cash on hand as of 12/31/2019: $10.8 billion

Lyft Revenue as of 12/31/2019: $3.6 billion

Uber Revenue as of 12/31/2019: $14.1 billion

Lyft Cash on hand to Revenue ratio: 10%

Uber Cash on hand to Revenue ratio: 77%

\*\*(ratio = cash  **√∑** revenue)\*\*

Uber only makes 4x as much revenue than Lyft does, yet, Uber has 30x as much cash on hand as Lyft does.

If Uber is estimating they can get through about a year with the cash they have on hand, proportionally based on revenue and current cash levels, Lyft has about at minimum 1 month and at maximum 2 months of cash on hand. To compound this, Lyft has NO delivery service. All revenue is rideshare. Lyft might honestly go bankrupt... Puts to zero guys.

\*\*10% \* 12 months (Uber estimated span of survival)\*\*

&#x200B;

edit: forgot to mention their operating market is 100% USA. No outside operations, unlike Uber. They are fucked."

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

2020-03-20 00:00:49,_elroy,1,"Alright, I'm fucking sick of r/WSBElite's hiding all the good DD. So I'm gonna make it free for you b/c you're one of the few retards here who ACTUALLY asked a decent question. 

For those of you OOL, r/WSBElite is basically where all of us fled after this sub got ravaged by retards (not you, OP. I'm replying to you because you're actually one of the good ones). 

They basically have sourced a list of insanely good scripts and data points to pretty much guarantee profits. Of course, if you don't know anything at all, it may be confusing at first, but even a retard like you would be able to figure it out. 

Try not to share it too much, because they may get pissy at me and ban me and I'm not on my alt. Also, do us a favor and post your gains when you're done.

# CALCULATORS

[http://www.prime-investing.com/LimitDownCalc/main.php](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+was+spy+closing+price+march+19+2020) is the SPY closing limit down. Use this to calculate your predicted losses.

[https://optioninvesting.com/hub/members/iv/index.php?=viewonly](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=percent+decrease+calculator) is a link that shows the percentage chance your options make bank. Really good at predicting IV

[https://dpool.money/secret/ds.htm](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+not+ask+stupid+questions+) is a link to a calculator called a ""DS Calculator"" -- it basically tells you which contracts MM's bought and their predicted gains. Super easy to find 1000% contracts there.

# SENTIMENT 

Here is how you can get ahead of what the sentiment for tomorrow will be. Works like magic, it's basically fucking time travel. 

[https://cloud.google.com/user/MMguild/build-alpha.php](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+kill+self+for+the+betterment+of+society)

# PREDICTORS

Here is a few links that help you determine where your position will be. These calculators are super rare so make sure you don't share. <3 

[http://ycharts.com/historical/average-nextday](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+am+I+always+downvoted) is a link to historical open prices following a specific closing price. Great for predicting recessions. 

# SECRET SUBS

Use this carefully -- if too many of you normies post there they'll shut down and move to another new sub. 

[http://www.reddit.com/r/WSBUnlisted](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+do+i+ask+stupid+questions+all+the+time+and+how+to+get+help) is a link the private WSB sub, most people don't know about it, but it's where all the real DD gets posted.

You're welcome."

It talks about the creation of options too but the main part about China starts 30 min in. Its a fascinating documentary if you haven't seen it.

2020-03-19 22:02:08,realister,5,"**The Shadow War Theory**

Our markets are under a coordinated liquidity attack. Someone with a lot of capital is draining liquidity as market makers are forced to take on terrible losing positions to provide transactions (liquidity) for people/firms desperately trying to hedge.

During a downturn firms want to hedge using puts to be short ""gamma"" so Market Makers are buying up calls to provide this liquidity. (nobody else is buying calls) MMs make money by trying to capture ""rebates"" (spreads) by taking on the opposite positions. This is how liquidity is provided. When a MM fills an investors buy order the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting the shares. They are forced to go short in order to sell a security they do not own. If there is a buyer, there has to be a seller otherwise firms/hedge funds are unable to hedge, bid/ask spreads rise and they start liquidating. (see -10% days)

So what is happening right now?

When someone is purchasing a large amount of puts the MMs take on huge unfavorable positions with calls on the opposite side of the trade. Right after the pump into close we have immediate huge fade after close. These huge swings after hours throw MMs into panic mode forcing them to either hedge by trading futures or selling shares at the open at significant loss magnifying the intraday swings.

The risk for MMs is how easily they can ""over hedge"" if the share price changes unexpectedly overnight. This is what they refer to as ""gap risk"" or ""inventory risk"". Large overnight moves create huge ""gamma"" swings which create periods of panic buying and selling which magnifies intraday swings as they desperately try to provide liquidity and reduce exposure.

**Who is doing this?**

Someone sinister is taking advantage of very poor liquidity in the markets creating periods of panic selling and buying. Could it be Russia? China? Saudis? Illuminati? Rogue AI? Federal Reserve? Its hard to say but something weird is going on 

Now we just need to figure out how to take advantage of this too and we can all retire early.

I'll preface this by saying that I am not a perma-bear or a perma-bull, I'm simply following immediate trends. Right now, I am holding /ES shorts @ 2420 average. While in the last 24 hours, I'm had two long plays that both turned out profitable. So I'm always looking to play both sides.

So we're going to be looking at this chart:

[https://i.imgur.com/5g936bp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5g936bp.jpg)

I've been sharing this chart for weeks, I am have been trading off it (successfully). The major level to be looking at is the trendline resistance, which is the diagonal line. We have been following this trendline ever since March 4, and today, we once against trading into the trendline. You can easily spot all the trendline tests by looking at the green boxes. As you can tell, once we touched the trendline today, we've reversed harshly on the 4-hour chart. 

**Things to consider:**

* The overall trend still remains bearish and will remain bearish as long as we are not able to break through the trendline. Which means, you size up on put/short plays, and size down on-call/long plays.
* Just because we rejected the trendline just now, does not mean that we are guaranteed to go down (a lot). We can see the trendline being re-tested tomorrow again, and who knows, it might actually break it finally. But, the ball is still in bear's court.
* Sellers will have to really gap us down soon, otherwise, we'll start retesting the trendline often. Inevitably, the market will break through the trendline once there aren't enough sellers on the trendline. What's interesting is that we're heading into the weekend, which is an opportunity to have a major gap down. The last gap down we've had since hitting the trendline was last weekend.

""The last day to trade stock options is the third Friday of the month, and settlement is determined on Saturday. The last day to trade index options is usually the Thursday before the third Friday of the month, followed by determination of the settlement value on Friday. The settlement value is then compared to the strike price of the option to see how much, if any, cash will change hands between the option buyer and seller.""

They don't have as much debt as Uber, but they also have significantly less cash. In other words, I don't think they'll be able to sustain themselves as well as Uber can during this pandemic.

I'm hoping for a green open, but I wouldn't be too concerned about a red one. I'll start panicking if there isn't a pump at 3. If I manage to sell my calls at open for a profit, then I'll spend a day trade to buy more calls before 3 and sell around 3:55."

The US version cut him out, but someone who was in the UK at the time saw it air there and he made the cut. I guess there are different versions for different countries?
