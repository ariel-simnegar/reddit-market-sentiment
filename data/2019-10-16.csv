Today's will be short. We more or less had another flat and gay day. We broke below our weekly momentum tradeline because of this continued gayness. This suggests that the runup to 305, if it occurs, is now delayed and based on current lines will not occur even EOM, barring a breakout. Nothing signals a change from bullish sentiment, however it is now more likely we have some neutral trading days where swings won't be as insane as the weeks prior.

This being said, we all know that TA doesn't tell the whole story. Next week will be the release of MAJOR tech stocks that drive a lot of SPY activity. If we have a succession of strong reports I suspect we break those momentum trendlines and go back into hopium OD. For now, TA says that even if we have very good earnings for the next two days, we'll test 302 at the very best but hover in that range as the top. If we break back into the earlier momentum trendlines I'll make a note in the daily thread because that will signal 305 EOW is not impossible, but for now it looks like the market has cooled off a bit."

Dear Mr. President:

Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson.

I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received.

History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!

K thx bye. I will call you later.

Sincerely,

Dear Cheeyina man 11,

You people, and I mean you got a lot of people, the most some would say. I would say probably the most, India has a lot but not like you Cheeyina, your the best at having the most people.

Anyways, I just wanted to let you know I am willing to let as many of you as I can starve to death if you continue to lowball me just enough on a deal to hurt my poll numbers even slightly.  

Lets face it eleven, you need pork, you need soy, believe me, you have got to try this latest batch, phenomenal soy beans, I may even throw in a bag of special “Trump” soy beans in the deal, however if you don’t throw in IP protection and tweet about how big my dick is, I’ll be eating my “Trump” soy beans while I watch fox news cover all the mass graves your digging from famine.

Xoxo

>Federal regulators might start here: In the last 10 minutes of trading on Friday, August 23, as the markets were roiling in the face of more bad trade news, someone bought 386,000 September e-minis. Three days later, Trump lied about getting a call from China to restart the trade talks, and the S&P 500 index shot up nearly 80 points. The potential profit on the trade was more than $1.5 billion.

It's now spiking and currently at $9.60 after hours.

What the fuck did I do to get cursed like this?"
2019-10-16 21:21:47,TaylorLH,2,"NFLX had absolutely atrocious Q4 guidance and still has negative free cash flow. CSX saw 5% revenue decline and beat on massive cost cutting(jobs). IBM missed on everything. BAC saw earnings -23% Y/Y. 

I think these earnings give a decent variety of sectors, and while we’re gonna moon some more I think the numbers make it pretty clear that being at ATH with these kind of ERs is asking for trouble."
2019-10-16 21:21:15,iamtony36,5,The winners of Netflix those who sold calls at $320 or higher. Fading already
2019-10-16 21:20:33,Midgetfarm,0,Hopefully sleep the next 16 hours
2019-10-16 21:19:33,workreddit2233,3,i bought SPY calls at the lunch-lows. 10/25 300c
2019-10-16 21:19:25,greentea45,4,"probably should have bought AMZN, ROKU and DIS calls instead of messing with NFLX.
Call in 40 mins
Please don't F up. The markets are counting on you, NFLX."
2019-10-16 21:19:15,mrthaumy,5,I plan to yell at my screen forcefully until my $DAL calls magically go up.
2019-10-16 21:19:10,Foolishoe,3,"Isn't there some strat where you buy options before earnings month and the volatility spikes bring in a profit? That way you don't even have to hold the bag, you sell it to retards on here..."
2019-10-16 21:18:51,M0ngoos,2,"Hopefully move my IBM FD put for some profit and grind my shitty poor account into enough cash for a decent sized play. The life of a poor. Oh but it’s payday so probably also add some cash to blow, I mean ‘invest’."
2019-10-16 21:18:24,freehouse_throwaway,3,"4/5 nflx condor for ER past few years. Not bad.

Hoping this stays well under 310 as my short calls are at 330"
2019-10-16 21:17:36,peekadeek,3,lmao those amzn calls I let go of Monday were ITM by 6 points today
2019-10-16 21:17:23,Jordykins850,3,"Watch my MasterCard, spy, T and Comcast calls MOON bby 🥰"
2019-10-16 21:16:55,fatfucksandalcohole,3,Sitting on a solid bag of PM calls. Gonna try to ride the up and down on Netflix a bit. Possibly SPY calls if we cross 300.
2019-10-16 21:16:36,MostlyKelp,3,"What is the likely best weed stock to own in 2023? Or should i say, which one under $10 is likely not to be de-listed by 2023?"
2019-10-16 21:16:18,love2fukmarriedwoman,6,"Ok dis$ wtf man 

Stay above 132 please"
2019-10-16 21:15:58,hedgelord1969,2,Wait till open and Chase SPY down if it opens red. If it opens green might YOLO a few 300c weeklies.
2019-10-16 21:15:47,,3,"So thoughts on gyna tonight.  Are they escalating futher, perhaps bending  the orange face over more and sticking a tiny one in?"
2019-10-16 21:14:05,jimmahtimmah,9,"so in all srsness, what are some catalysts to go higher? I'm bleeding on some puts. from a technical standpoint, it looks like we're hitting the same resistance we've been at since early 2018. trade stuff doesn't seem to be going very well. 

I'm not sure how to think about not-QE b/c ever since drumpf won, the market has overshot the asset side of the feds balance sheet which it had been tracking pretty closely for the past 10 years. I don't think we'll see a repeat of the ever declining vol with stonks slowly marching up on no volume. Macro data is increasingly shitty from around the world is it not? no deal brexit still seems like it's going to happen right?"
2019-10-16 21:14:04,whoyoucallingmf,5,Fuck my last minute decision to get IBM calls.

2019-10-16 21:12:09,,3,"Speaking of NIO and CHK.  If  they drop below their 52-week low, I am going to buy a shit ton of shares of both (and hopefully profit, massively and irresponsibly)"
2019-10-16 21:11:57,The_Devils_Triad,3,I held my AMD puts 😳
2019-10-16 21:11:47,CAPSLOCK44,5,"How did I end up negative on my AMD calls today, you ask? Because I am retarded.
Also Ulta can suck a dick, there is no reason for it to continue to trade so flat."

2019-10-16 21:10:22,,8,"Pretty sure, tomorrow Netflix will  open +3-5%  (and this is very optimistic).  IMHO,  Its guidance and numbers are **shit**.  Just because they didn't burn more  through cash or subscribed even less folks, doesn't mean they should go up  as much as they did in AH.


BTW, I don't have a position in  Netflix.  I am just a dude who thinks that 10%+ is outrageous.Now...**AMA**"
