That being said, from stories I've heard if you own a Tesla in a non large city, you'd short this. Tesla unfortunately still has pretty disappointing infrastructure throughout the US. Example: If you own a Tesla in Iowa and you're driving to work and some dickhead rear ends you, you have to take your Tesla to Kansas City or Minneapolis in order to get it repaired.

If it's not driveable? You need to get that shit towed around 200mi in order to get it repaired (not sure if you've ever had to have a car towed, but that shit gets expensive real fucking quick). And you'll likely have to wait awhile for them to order the parts as well."

And yet we‚Äôre right where we were before on better than expected earnings, a fake meat Phase 1, algos keeping us around ATH on no trade news, and hopes that Trump walks away from the only major leverage he has left (Dec tariffs).

Last call is approaching this latest fulcrum point, break up or break down. History has shown we won‚Äôt remain at this level for much longer. I‚Äôd place bets early tomorrow as the Microsoft deal pumps SPY and before the Fed meet for the lead-up to APEC."
