That being said, from stories I've heard if you own a Tesla in a non large city, you'd short this. Tesla unfortunately still has pretty disappointing infrastructure throughout the US. Example: If you own a Tesla in Iowa and you're driving to work and some dickhead rear ends you, you have to take your Tesla to Kansas City or Minneapolis in order to get it repaired.

If it's not driveable? You need to get that shit towed around 200mi in order to get it repaired (not sure if you've ever had to have a car towed, but that shit gets expensive real fucking quick). And you'll likely have to wait awhile for them to order the parts as well."
