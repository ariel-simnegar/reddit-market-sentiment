But then, when ü•áü•à-gang hoped for rate cuts alongside of üêÇ-gang, we got expelled from our family.



Since then, PreciousMetal-gang is independent from the dichotomy of stock-betting-retards. And because PreciousMetals performed relatively poorly, ü•áü•à-gang got seperated & isolated.




I call on my former bretherens to buy GLD & SLV calls expiring next week, next month & next year. This is our time. The Coronavirus is going to hit the markets and cause fear (which means PreciousMetals go up), rate cuts will ease the fear, but weaken the Dollar, causing an increase in the demand of PreciousMetals.
