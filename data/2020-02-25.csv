But then, when ü•áü•à-gang hoped for rate cuts alongside of üêÇ-gang, we got expelled from our family.



Since then, PreciousMetal-gang is independent from the dichotomy of stock-betting-retards. And because PreciousMetals performed relatively poorly, ü•áü•à-gang got seperated & isolated.




I call on my former bretherens to buy GLD & SLV calls expiring next week, next month & next year. This is our time. The Coronavirus is going to hit the markets and cause fear (which means PreciousMetals go up), rate cuts will ease the fear, but weaken the Dollar, causing an increase in the demand of PreciousMetals.

My prediction is that we have a massive rally tomorrow as people actually believe that we‚Äôre oversold and this is a buying opportunity and then more bad news hits Thursday or Friday and we reverse much lower. I sold some BABA puts today at a tiny profit because I didn‚Äôt like the relative strength it was showing and wanted to raise some more cash to add more QQQ puts if we do get a strong rally one of these days. Also interested in possibly adding more TSLA puts as it was relatively weak today compared to the market and was just clinging to $800 the entire afternoon.

2020-02-26 00:51:54,knotswag,25,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

We broke numerous supports today (3 in total), hitting the final support before my projected ""end' of a correction at 309-310 that [I mentioned last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuvf8/weekend_discussion_thread_january_31_february_2/fg4oacw/) 312.5 had a slightly stronger upward reaction. [The crayons are here, with blues being supports we broke through and the green being where we stopped today.](https://imgur.com/PuGkPb7)

What's the other green crayon sloping down? That's the typical trajectory of previous corrections we've had in the past two years. What you can notice is that we're a bit ""oversold"" in the sense that the sell-off as happened a bit too quickly, based on history. So normally we'd expect at least some consolidation or upward movement tomorrow, which is potentially being reflected by the green in futures.

It's hard to tell whether we'll hit the full correction. So far, each drop we've had has fallen well short of supports that I would anticipate would finish the correction-- this is the farthest we've gotten. So I would just say that if we break the ""correction"" line soon, I would wait for a small run-up before getting more puts. In the past few corrections we've had, we've had consolidation/recovery before one more test of the bottom (see: Feb, Oct '18) before the true trend in the market revealed itself (i.e. more downside or not). 

The 309-310 price is significant because it represents ""healthy"" growth, i.e. what SPY would be if we weren't trading at our current valuations. As a result, I don't anticipate us shooting past it, or if we do, not for long.

Best of luck to everyone out there. Keep your tendies in line, it's rough out there nowadays."

2020-02-26 00:41:33,_elroy,14,"Alright guys. Let's be real. Whether or not corona is going to kill us all is up for debate. But here's what not:

America is about to get hit with a media storm about corona. It is not being politicized in the senate with these classified briefings. This will be put in headlines as a critique against Trump and his HLS's failure to manage this. 

We are the last to get hit, but we will get hit. Unlike a lot of countries, our citizens are likely to stay home and continue going to work to avoid the poor tax of being sick and needing medical attention. Even if just 10% of people act this way, it's bad. Trump will likely opt against any sort of welfare for those who are out of work to promote the decision of self quarantine. 

CDC is not equipped to deal with this effectively under Trump's administration and their recent budget cuts. They're scrambling between appeasing the current administration and pulling off a miracle with hardly any dollars. 

Once this hits a city like LA, Chicago, or NYC, we will see enormous shifts in public opinion. If you look at how the media in Italy was reporting on this before their outbreak, you'll see it looks similar to ours.

I'm a bull for sure, but I'm about to dump everything I've got into long dated puts. Another huge drop is inevitable. Keep in mind that we are so far into red on intangible consequences of corona, from the perspective of citizens. Shipping and global supply chains are invisible to mom and dad. What isn't invisible is the fear of going to walmart. Even worse, we don't have the manufacturing to supplement our population with preparation supplies such as masks. Most of the world has donated or hoarded theirs, so us having an outbreak in the late game is truly a problem. 

There is money to be made in the short term call game, for sure. We will have several big green days before what is to come. What's next is not a correction nor a dip, it's a halt. The only way loading up on long dated puts will fail is if Trump halts the market, which will not happen for more than a day or two, if that. It's too far from trumps normal demeanor. 

We are in for a rude awakening, as was Italy, Japan, and China. The olympics will likely be canceled. Fear will spread and money will be taken out of stocks and put into precious metals and treasuries by those who are smart, otherwise it'll just be held as cash. Cash that will be held by fearful investors that will likely opt to partially reinvest or resist reinvesting as a whole once their portfolios drop. 

Unlike so many financial disasters we've had, this cannot be resolved by repos, bailouts, ect. This will only be resolved by the alleviation of fear, which will not just go away with some investor friendly news. 

As an added bonus, misinformation campaigns have been set into play by foreign agents to intentionally cause fear mongering in the States over corona. This will have a compounding effect when the misinformation/lies are coupled with truthful MSM headlines, stock market declines, and growing global cases. 

Call it ""just the flu"", call it ""only hurts boomers"" all you want, but you cannot deny that the only response to this by the US will be catastrophic in the short term to our economy. Of course, we will bounce back, but this isn't going to be a simple ride down and back up in a few weeks. 

You may be thinking ""what about the vaccines"". Remember that vaccines only work when the majority of the population uses them. That leaves us with two problems:

- 15-30% (depending on study) of citizens believe vaccines cause autism. that demographic is majority white young to middle aged females. That means KIDS are not going to be vaccinated either. 

- The need to quickly and effectively produce and distribute new medicine is EXTREMELY fucking difficult. It causes pools of people waiting for their turn and many wont get it, which just makes a cesspool of infection in densely populated sectors, even in areas that are not densely populated. Your town of 1000 people in bumfuck nebraska may be safe from Corona, until 300 of you line up at the local memorial hospital to get your shot.

This is assuming too that these vaccines work beyond just preventative treatment. Assuming that it only helps prevent infection, you are now racing against the virus to get as many people possible vaccinated before it continues to spread. The virus spreads FREE OF CHARGE and invisibly. The vaccine is gonna cost money for the round trip. If every day you vaccinate 200 people and 50-100 people are infected, you may mitigate a mass epidemic, but if we hit this point we're already fucked because we'll still see huge numbers of infections. 

As large cities are infected, most of the transplants will fly home to be with family away from the crowded areas which will eventually cause infections in more rural areas that are otherwise safe. Along the way, people on those flights will others as well. If you can imagine the absolute economical cluster fuck that is grounding all domestic flights, then your heart rate should be increasing right about now, because that's literally our last preventative measure that can drastically reduce infection. 

This is not a drill. This is not a meme. This is for real. I fucking hope I'm wrong, but the way this is happening, it's hard to be informed without saying that this is inevitable."

If the cost of the doctor visit and the tests run 3,000$ most people would simple not do it. 

It is an interesting thought because it causes several things :

1. People with the flu would simply not go to work and think they would rest it off. If they went to the doctor, they can be cured and become productive again in a week as opposed to two weeks for bed rest, assuming they do recover.

This causes higher economic impact as someone who doesn't get treated doesn't get well soon - so economic productivity goes down more as compared to someone who gets treated and goes back to work soon.

2. Allows the government to fudge numbers of true deaths by Corona virus."

all with puts gain from IWM, AMZN, RH, and a few other random SPX/SPY shit.

but i think ill chill on the dip buying soon cuz honestly you want cash to play the other side if things come to a complete rout/correction.

lots of things are still premium priced. PLNT drilled 7% in ER today (10% implied move) but at $75 it'll still be higher than where it was at last ER 

WYNN drilled a further 4% today to $113, but its 2019 intra year lows were $10X during each trade war scuffles.

LULU, the beacon of becky has pulled back quite a bit from its crazy highs of 26X. a quick 20 pt drill from just 3 days. but the ran-up from last ER (of which it fade about 6% due to lofty valuation) was at 224. and this is on top of all of its 36 stores in china closed. its growth catalyst are the men's wear and international expansion and eventually valuation will be checked if the growth story no longer pans out. 

other wacky shit includes LK, which is up 3% today back to $38s. this is amid stores closing in China though this was always a meme stock.

all of the above is moot though if Jpow says the magic word."

It‚Äôs just completely random when they happen. You can look at technical indicators, oversold conditions, RSI readings, none of it matters because they can all be false signals. But buying weekly calls for the last five months has been straight cash homie. Not some random 2 day -6% situation none of us can time. What you can time is slow movement upwards with weekly calls.

2020-02-25 22:03:03,Wizard_of_Ozymandias,198,"I was on a business trip in 2008. I woke up in the hotel room to the alarm on my Blackberry. I didn't check the market, I didn't browse reddit, I didn't send any texts. I took a shit, read some stories on literotica dot com, rubbed one out in the shower and got ready to go to work. 

While eating breakfast in the hotel lobby, I glanced up at the television. It was on CNBC. They were running some sort of joke story about Bear Stearns employees walking out of the building with boxes full of their stuff. The ticker said something about Bear Stearns dropping to $2.00/share. I shook my head and took a sip of orange juice. 

Just to be sure, I went back up to my room, where my laptop was plugged in to the ethernet cable. I logged on to my eTrade account. 

Wait, what?

I looked again.

My account had $2,700 in it. My account that was just recently near $75,000. An account that included 700 SHARES of Bear Stearns. I thought eTrade was glitching so I logged off and went to work, smiling and interacting with clients like nothing had happened, but the sinking sensation that I had just lost seventy grand. 

Etrade never did fix that glitch. That's why now I only play with small amounts through Robin Hood and days like the last few, while shitty, don't affect my completely numb existence."

2020-02-25 21:56:24,kknano1256,11,"Welcome to MAGICAL LINE TA TIME (/ES):

If anyone was reading my posts in the daily thread, we sold off at open to complete 1 extension target down at 3173 which we bounced off of before drilling almost straight through the next extension at ~3147. After that we bounced off the 3rd extension at 3122ish to hit the half way back from the previous high before we drilled through 3173. The 3122 level acted as end of day support without us breaking through except for a couple moments around 5:30 before bouncing back up. Next two extension targets downward are 3104 and then 3073. 

If VIX does not start going back down to the 20-22 levels (below 20 indicates a bearish to bullish change) and some other catalyst pops up, I'd fully expect us to keep drilling down to the targets stated before.

With these back to back 3% days and the mini sell off that we had on friday, another 3% in the red means we are in official correction territory (10%)."

Used my put gains to stock up on goods. (Whom am I kidding those shit were cheap at WMT and COST).

If you have a family, sensitive group like young children, elderly or ppl with special needs, stock up on stuff that you'll need. (Meds, diapers, etc.)

It isn't likely that the US is going to come to a complete halt, but it is possible your daily life will run into some disruption of some sort if an outbreak happens in your community.

This gives you a chance to avoid rushing to stores, pharmacies, when everyone else is too.
