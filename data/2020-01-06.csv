🌈Gay mods🌈 have limited me to one post every ten minutes. This makes it impossible to carry on conversations. So I’m answering everyone in one post. 

u/warren_buffoon Yes, still at it. Just blowing up money. Won’t give up. One FD and I get it all back. I keep telling myself once one of these FDs pay off I will stop gambling, take all the training courses on TD website, and will make sick gains. I’m not tagging out to learn until I’m back to even. 

u/yinatom Sorry, I don’t read emoji

u/Crosa13 I guess my best score was turning about $500 into about $7000 on the Disney plus announcement but I usually just blow money up. Overall I’m down like 15k for 2019. FDs are stupid and once I am back to even I will play it smart and safe. Couple months out with hard stops to cut losses. 

u/wolf_of_wall_mart you call it rape I call it extra curricular activities. No just means you’re not trying hard enough.  

u/winkerpack Sometimes a man just needs to make a point. I should have gotten it months back on a Friday post but fuck me so now I take matters into my own hands.

 If you don't like retarded market strength you should be a temporary bull. Just BTFD and screech ""Stonks only go up"". And do it as long as J Powel & other Cbankers notice you doing it! when even bears are buying dips and drinking mohitos on new yachts. Thats the tipping point when they have to start cooling the market off before the markets become fully autistic.

I would like to be a bear myself because prices & fundamental are on average moving to opposite directions, but its not worth it, so not yet). Calls on dips or stay Cash and be ready! cash is an optionality as well, it gives an opportunity to buy dips :) or even short after things have downhill a bit. But remember the volatility will probably increase and temporary recoveries will fuck you if you have too big positions."

Central banks around the world (Riksbank, Bundesbank) are waking up to the fact that negative rates don't offer much in the way of stimulus to the real economy, and are reversing course or at least holding steady.  The next wave of stimulus won't be rate cutting, it'll be asset buying."
