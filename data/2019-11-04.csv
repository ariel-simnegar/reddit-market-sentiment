It just makes him look so dejected 😞 honestly there’s hope though because I don’t think robin hood can make him pay them back since there are regulations for this sort of thing. From the SEC website:

Know the Margin Rules

The Federal Reserve Board and many self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the NYSE and FINRA, have rules that govern margin trading. **Brokerage firms can establish their own requirements as long as they are at least as restrictive as the Federal Reserve Board and SRO rules**

Amount You Can Borrow – Initial Margin

**According to Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, you may borrow up to 50 percent** of the purchase price of securities that can be purchased on margin. This is known as the ""initial margin."" Some firms require you to deposit more than 50 percent of the purchase price. Also be aware that not all securities can be purchased on margin.

Amount You Need After You Trade – Maintenance Margin

After you buy stock on margin, FINRA requires you to keep a minimum amount of equity in your margin account. The equity in your account is the value of your securities less how much you owe to your brokerage firm. **The rules require you to have at least 25 percent of the total market value of the securities in your margin account at all times.** The 25 percent is called the ""maintenance requirement."" In fact, many brokerage firms have higher maintenance requirements, typically between 30 to 40 percent, and sometimes higher depending on the type of stock purchased.

To stop all future margin may not even be an option without the above logic change (adding yet another feature). Banning gold outright probably is doable  but it would be PR suicide. 

So they just run a sql query every 30-120 minutes to see who is massively above margin and ban them. The problem is, that's a lot of logic to test and false positive banning people isn't good PR either. worse if they close these positions they are in a bind over liability and legality. Margin call someone with $10k for $1m. Who is liable? Can you legally throw them in collections? What are the chances of ever seeing whatever losses he incurred? Do you have grounds to seize his account and ban him?

RH, its investors, its lawyers, and its insurers must be in a panic right now. For every front page autist doing this there's probably 10,000 guys quietly doing it in the background. RH is way out of its own personal risk tolerance. It may already be bankrupt."

With the Verizon and Disney plus deal on top of that I think we are going to see more splintering of streaming devices and services in an effort to give consumers less access to other competitors and push them more towards their platforms.

That being said I dont know how well this will divert people to specific streaming services (although in this specific case this doesnt help netflix) but I do know the streaming platform that offers the most access to these streaming services will probably benefit the most from this. 

In my mind that's Roku, this is their bread and butter and will likely retain all streaming services on their devices. It's also already the cheap alternative to a smart tv and is a favorite for cord cutters. Dont be GUH and get Roku Calls, literally cant go tits up."

# FT:US considers dropping some tariffs on China

Trump administration officials are debating whether to remove some existing tariffs on Chinese goods as a concession to seal a partial deal that would pause the trade war with Beijing as early as this month. 

&#x200B;

According to five people briefed on the discussions, the White House is considering whether to roll back levies on $112bn of Chinese imports — including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors — that were introduced at a 15 per cent rate on September 1. 

&#x200B;

Such a move by the US would meet a core demand from Beijing as negotiators from the world’s two largest economies work out the terms of a ceasefire to be signed in the coming weeks by Donald Trump, the US president, and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart. 

&#x200B;

But Washington would likely expect something in return, including beefed up provisions on the protection of intellectual property for US companies, greater certainty on the scale of Chinese purchases of US farm products, and a signing ceremony for the agreement on American soil. 

&#x200B;

Washington has already suspended a planned increase in tariffs on $250bn of goods from 25 per cent to 30 per cent that was due to take effect on October 15, after a visit from top Chinese negotiators to the US capital in early October. 

&#x200B;

US officials have also suggested that Beijing could avoid the planned imposition of tariffs on $156bn of mostly consumer goods due to hit at the height of the holiday season on December 15, if it struck a deal with Washington. 

&#x200B;

Officials in Beijing have been demanding that Washington take a further step and retract some existing levies on Chinese goods for the first time since the beginning of the trade war between the two countries in early 2018, as the limited agreement draws closer. It is a step that has been resisted by Trump officials so far.

&#x200B;

One person familiar with the matter cautioned that although there was a growing consensus within the Trump administration that they have to make a concession on existing levies, it was unclear whether the US president himself would sign off, so the rollback may not materialise. 

&#x200B;

Plans for Mr Trump and Mr Xi to sign what the US president has dubbed a “phase one” agreement at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile on November 17 were thrown off course by the cancellation of the event due to the civil unrest there. Officials have been scrambling to find alternative venues ever since, with Brazil and the US considered the most likely options.

&#x200B;

Within the US, the states of Hawaii and Alaska have been mooted, along with Iowa, a key state in the presidential election whose agricultural exports have been hit by the trade war and which could benefit if Beijing agrees to restart purchases. 

&#x200B;

If a rollback of existing levies were a part of the truce, the deal would have a broader beneficial economic impact at a time when officials around the world are fretting about a global slowdown in growth. 

&#x200B;

Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group, said that there were incentives for both China and the US to reach a pact along those lines.

&#x200B;

“Each side has decided that getting to this deal is important at this point and to get there is going to require some concessions. The administration is going to have to show some leg on tariffs and the Chinese are doing to have to accept a more robust IP chapter,” Mr Brilliant said. 

&#x200B;

Hawks in Washington within the administration and on Capitol Hill may object that the US would be losing leverage by rolling back existing tariffs and expose Mr Trump to accusations that he caved too easily to Beijing as he heads into the 2020 re-election campaign.

&#x200B;

“Rolling back existing tariffs is risky for Mr Trump,” said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “Right now he can point to a falling trade deficit with China as undoing some of the damage he campaigned so strongly against in 2016. Removing tariffs and seeing the deficit rise would allow Democrats to say he lied to voters.”

&#x200B;

The White House declined to comment. The office of the US trade representative and the US Treasury department declined to comment. "

2019-11-04 23:23:31,knotswag,5,"Happy Monday and time to kick off **Magical Crayons TA!**

There's no major developments today compared to Friday. Today's jump upwards has made me adjust a few crayon trendlines, mostly the longterm trendline which now suggests our new max trading top is 310ish EOW, with anything breaking early being abnormal and would likely need a correction. 

We're still in hopium range and as I said at closing of Friday, technicals suggest we get a correction this week because we're trading at divergent highs. How large that correction is would be TBD, but probably at least a gap fill to 306, which is already higher than what I had drawn for last week. And as I said last week, I'll expect a correction before or around Nov 6-7. 

During the weekend I studied some market patterns in relation to the sort of economic news we'll be seeing this week. Once we get past tomorrow, most domestic economic news (i.e. unemployment claims, crude oil) had not shifted the market majorly last year, so again I expect if we get a pullback based on those news pieces it would be before EOD Thursday. 

That's all folks. Hold your tendies tight and your GUHs even tighter."
