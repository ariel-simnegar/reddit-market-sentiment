It just makes him look so dejected 😞 honestly there’s hope though because I don’t think robin hood can make him pay them back since there are regulations for this sort of thing. From the SEC website:

Know the Margin Rules

The Federal Reserve Board and many self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the NYSE and FINRA, have rules that govern margin trading. **Brokerage firms can establish their own requirements as long as they are at least as restrictive as the Federal Reserve Board and SRO rules**

Amount You Can Borrow – Initial Margin

**According to Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, you may borrow up to 50 percent** of the purchase price of securities that can be purchased on margin. This is known as the ""initial margin."" Some firms require you to deposit more than 50 percent of the purchase price. Also be aware that not all securities can be purchased on margin.

Amount You Need After You Trade – Maintenance Margin

After you buy stock on margin, FINRA requires you to keep a minimum amount of equity in your margin account. The equity in your account is the value of your securities less how much you owe to your brokerage firm. **The rules require you to have at least 25 percent of the total market value of the securities in your margin account at all times.** The 25 percent is called the ""maintenance requirement."" In fact, many brokerage firms have higher maintenance requirements, typically between 30 to 40 percent, and sometimes higher depending on the type of stock purchased.
