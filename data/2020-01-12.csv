2020-01-13 08:49:34,SoundShadowZ,5,"I’m assuming because we all all actively trading and watching the market, some of you fucks likely watch your 401k.

Is it common for your employer to randomly deposit money into your 401k?

They randomly gave me $1500 on top of my match.

Seems to be a semi regular thing. About 6x a year. I’m a still a freshie at work so I’ve only got about 1.5yr track record with this employer. The random contributions seem to be ramping up in value as well.

Any insight on this would be great

EDIT: IM A FUCK STICK. I’m going answer my own retarded question here.

It’s a non elective contribution. They take 30% of my current earnings from that date and they just give me that money in my 401k I’m not sure how or why they pick such dates... but they are fucking ballooning my 401k for free which is fucking awesome. This shit was never disclosed to me one time so this information is amazing news.

If you are a pheasant employee such as myself I highly suggest working for some asshole who does this for you.

Side note: Maybe don’t call your employer an asshole if they give you tax free free money."
