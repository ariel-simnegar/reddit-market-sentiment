2020-01-13 08:49:34,SoundShadowZ,4,"I’m assuming because we all all actively trading and watching the market, some of you fucks likely watch your 401k.

Is it common for your employer to randomly deposit money into your 401k?

They randomly gave me $1500 on top of my match.

Seems to be a semi regular thing. About 6x a year. I’m a still a freshie at work so I’ve only got about 1.5yr track record with this employer. The random contributions seem to be ramping up in value as well.

Any insight on this would be great

EDIT: IM A FUCK STICK. I’m going answer my own retarded question here.

It’s a non elective contribution. They take 30% of my current earnings from that date and they just give me that money in my 401k I’m not sure how or why they pick such dates... but they are fucking ballooning my 401k for free which is fucking awesome. This shit was never disclosed to me one time so this information is amazing news.

If you are a pheasant employee such as myself I highly suggest working for some asshole who does this for you.

Side note: Maybe don’t call your employer an asshole if they give you tax free free money."

Woke up with headache, ate, laid down, then fell asleep for like 8-9 hours and woke up around 12:30pm. Woke up once but went back to bed. Then ate again, brushed teeth, laid down and got sleepy, and took a nap for a little less than two hours.

If my quick maths checks out, that's about 17-18 hours or sleep. Wow, so nice to finally catch up a bit since the entire week it was only 4-5 hours per day. 

Late Friday evening someone mentioned in a PM to stop taking magnesium since it could affect sleep. Hard to pin point exactly why I'm sleeping better, but that's got to be one of them.

Well now it is time for an all nighter. Plan to be awake til around 3pm PT tomorrow, which is around 22 hours of awake time from the nap.

Of course futures gapped up and I closed literally at the bottom. Also sold more naked calls on AMZN (1920, 1925, 1935) so I hope it doesn't moon too much. Figured 2-3% wiggle room is good enough with AMZN for weekly."
