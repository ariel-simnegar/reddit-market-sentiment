Apparently, it can negatively impact fertility in men. A doctor on another forum mentioned this may also include difficulty ejaculating... No info on whether it will impact pleasure or erection ""strength."" Moving on...

Furthermore, the head of the CDC said this virus ""may likely become a community virus."" This means they're expecting the US to have outbreaks similar to China's, though not as severe of course. So... guys, both bulls and bears and everybody in between... it's really not ""just the flu."" Protect yourselves! Seriously. Source.

Dumb normie question: the market instantly gaps up or down depending on early market movement, and thus options prices instantly adjust.  Without getting cucked on market orders, do limit purchases placed before open increase your chances of getting in before prices rocket up?

I usually place limit orders but never tried to buy going right into the day, I‚Äôm usually purchasing after things settle in for 30-60 mins like a regular jackass.

We had a ""down"" day today in that we closed red [as foretold by the crayons,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2plur/daily_discussion_thread_february_12_2020/fhfazvo/) but for all intents and purposes we were flat. Buyers (or algos, or repo, or whatever pumping) continue to step in when weakness shows. Looking at /NQ futures, we're still following the crayons perfectly, [including a reaction last night at resistance and another reaction today to close.](https://imgur.com/XH4DTvx) As I mentioned yesterday, this trend has been extremely strong (since Nov 2019) so until it breaks this trend I think we'll trudge along-- small pullback, slow grind up. Rinse repeat until we break support, then we re-assess if it can break back into this Nov 2019 channel.

For all other crayons, SPY and VIX are testing their resistance/support once again after both having a reaction, as I outlined last post. Because we're in a bullish market, even if they keep sitting along ""testing"" their trends, because SPY is in an uptrend and VIX is in a downtrend, it means the market will eventually wind up being green until further notice.

For those playing MSFT, it's still hovering at its support after breaking from its January upward trend so nothing notable to report since Tuesday.

People have been wondering if there will be broad market sell-off tomorrow. If there is, we have good support at 335.3, which if it goes will lead to approximately 334.7. Resistance tomorrow end of the day is 338, but since we've been trading in a divergent high lately, the other resistance is 338.7.

Retail sales is being announced tomorrow and has traditionally far underperformed the 0.3% projection during Feb. Keep an eye out and keep your tendies safe and sound."
