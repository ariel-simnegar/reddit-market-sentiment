Apparently, it can negatively impact fertility in men. A doctor on another forum mentioned this may also include difficulty ejaculating... No info on whether it will impact pleasure or erection ""strength."" Moving on...

Furthermore, the head of the CDC said this virus ""may likely become a community virus."" This means they're expecting the US to have outbreaks similar to China's, though not as severe of course. So... guys, both bulls and bears and everybody in between... it's really not ""just the flu."" Protect yourselves! Seriously. Source.
