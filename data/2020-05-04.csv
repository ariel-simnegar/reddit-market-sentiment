2020-05-05 09:59:01,,0,Fellas Reddit is having a coin sale.  Might be worth considering.  Something else to baghold with puts in these trying times and they might not expire worthless.
2020-05-05 09:58:22,PersianMG,2,"SPY has basically followed the same pattern after we hit the March 18 lows. It rallies then there are 2 red days then it rallies again. Go and look at SPY on 1 month/daily chart to see what I mean.

Now history isn't an indicator of the future necessarily but its happened 4 times now.  If trend is to continue we now have 2-3 days of green before the next pullback. Its important to note each pullback has been smaller and smaller (-5%, -4%, -3%) meaning SPY is slowly 'settling down' to some value which I think is roughly $290. At that point it will begin to have tiny gains/delays like SPY normally should (as an ETF). VIX will fall off and options will lose a lot of value due to IV dropping off.

I've been doing well at playing with this exact pattern (my positions are mostly calls and I've bought a few puts to catch the pullbacks). I bought a bunch of SPY calls Friday close/Monday open which are even yesterday and in profits today but will sell them tomorrow.

Most important thing is I want to be 100% cash when SPY does slow down because that is when I can safely transition into stocks. For those thinking Spy is going to dip back to 220 etc, there is absolutely no way unless there is new major developments. We'd be lucky to see SPY below 270 for remainder of year in my personal opinion."
