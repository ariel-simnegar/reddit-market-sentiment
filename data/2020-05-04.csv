2020-05-05 09:58:22,PersianMG,2,"SPY has basically followed the same pattern after we hit the March 18 lows. It rallies then there are 2 red days then it rallies again. Go and look at SPY on 1 month/daily chart to see what I mean.

Now history isn't an indicator of the future necessarily but its happened 4 times now.  If trend is to continue we now have 2-3 days of green before the next pullback. Its important to note each pullback has been smaller and smaller (-5%, -4%, -3%) meaning SPY is slowly 'settling down' to some value which I think is roughly $290. At that point it will begin to have tiny gains/delays like SPY normally should (as an ETF). VIX will fall off and options will lose a lot of value due to IV dropping off.

I've been doing well at playing with this exact pattern (my positions are mostly calls and I've bought a few puts to catch the pullbacks). I bought a bunch of SPY calls Friday close/Monday open which are even yesterday and in profits today but will sell them tomorrow.

Most important thing is I want to be 100% cash when SPY does slow down because that is when I can safely transition into stocks. For those thinking Spy is going to dip back to 220 etc, there is absolutely no way unless there is new major developments. We'd be lucky to see SPY below 270 for remainder of year in my personal opinion."

2020-05-05 09:17:39,akatheaja,3," My  € 0.02 on  ze German Federal Constitutional Courts decision 

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Bundesbank must stop buying government bonds under the European Central Bank’s long-running stimulus scheme \[  2.7 trillion-euro ($2.95 trillion) since credit crunch, case was filed in 2015 \]  within the next three months unless the ECB can prove those purchases are needed, Germany’s top court ruled on Tuesday.

&#x200B;

\[ QE originally ran from early 2015 until the end of 2018, and was controversially resumed late last year. Total holdings were 2.7 trillion euros at the end of March, with at least another 300 billion euros scheduled for this year to help fight the recession sparked by the coronavirus. \]

But the judges in Karlsruhe said their decision did not apply to the ECB’s latest pandemic-fighting programme, a 750 billion euro scheme approved last month to prop up the economy. \[some estimating 1 trillion euros printed by EOY\]

Ruling in a case that dates back three years, Germany’s top court raised objections to the German Bundesbank’s participation in the scheme, known as Public Sector Purchase Programme.

“The Bundesbank may thus no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue, unless the ECB Governing Council adopts a new decision that demonstrates...the PSPP are not disproportionate to the economic and fiscal policy effects,” the judges said.

They added the German central bank must also sell the bonds already bought, albeit based “on a – possibly long-term – strategy coordinated with” the rest of the euro zone.

&#x200B;

\[ The German case is: BVerfG, 2 BvR 859/15 et al. note this ruling comes after the European Court of Justice has already cleared the scheme in 2017, arguing that it does not constitute illegal financing and considers the ECB’s measures proportional. The ECJ trumps national courts, in legal theory, though 3 years ago was a different world \]

&#x200B;

TLDR; short EUR/USD"

LVS. lotta Macau. some Vegas. earnings timing was perfect. that was a pretty reliable play. Sheldon is trying to make his Cotai Strip thing. should be able to take advantage of China recovering while still getting a pop from Vegas reopen.

MGM. balanced between Macau, Vegas, regionals. debt will get them through the pandemic but the timing of the announcement was right before earnings which hurt them. but if you're looking for a safe bet long term for casinos then this is your play. 
they're the most widely spread outta the casinos and so the least vulnerable to issues in one particular area.

CZR/ERI. everything has to be in context with the merger. started late last year with $8.40 per share and I forget how much of ERI per CZR but it would have been around like $12 or something at the time including the $8.40 but now ERI is lower. merger is basically a go but might not finish until June. they cleared a lotta potential issues that could have been an problem. but until then CZR seems to be getting pinned under $10. if it goes much higher you risk not getting value from the merger. but that also will limit how far they could drop if Vegas reopen goes poorly. as for ERI they should benefit from a Vegas pop. also the merger being successful should give them a pop as well.

WYNN. like 90% Macau 10% Vegas. this isn't a Vegas play. it's a Macau play. that potentially means that they could recover faster than the others but also might not get as much of a pop when Vegas reopens. if you want a major casino without much Vegas in case that shit goes south with reopen then this is your play."

After backtesting the model, you'd then just look what option has an expected_value_at_expiry of greater than 110% of the current ask and then buy that option. or a fair value of less than 90% of the bid, then you'd sell the option.

To capture systematic evolution of the daily volume, someone suggested to approximate Vd by the function of time with four parameters found by calibration, Vd = A(T−t) B(t−T0) C e D(t−T0) , A > 0, B > 0, C > 0, D > 0, T0 ≤ t ≤ T

but it's not like WSB, you can't fuck around and call people faggots or be sarcastic, only on topic market talk.

Next level is 2822... tested a few times and failed and dipped to 2808 around 10:15 am pst.. It didn't break 2800 and eventually climbed back up to 2822.. Then I looked at BA AAPL NVDA- 3 diff stocks - airplane manufacturer/aerospace stock/tech/semiconductor  all 3 held key support levels so if these 3 hold and SPX held key levels. It implies the market may not go lower(yet) So once you come to the conclusion that the market may not break lower.. You assess and look at which stocks are out performing today.. You have NFLX,NOW,ROKU,TSLA, and others..you just have to pick a strong stock and trade it based on your plan/strategy etc.

Say you're around at the time — your sole responsibility is to focus and kill every murder hornet. 

You're able to kill them all; yes maybe a honeybee or two fell victim to the couple mistakes you made during your mission.

Question is — how would the honeybees react to you? Would they consider you as one of their own? A family? Maybe a King to their queen? I just took out basically 30 juggernauts to their 30,000 armless chihuahuas. 

I'm down as fuck to have an army of 30,000 honeybees that have my back when them fuckin flies wanna buzz all over my face or those damn mosquitos wanna fuck around."

With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg badass. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy."

Ok so on top of the cosmetics and shit they been making bank on in games like modern warfare (warzone), classic WoW and overwatch (lmao), they’ve also been selling a remastered version of modern warfare 2 (came out like 10 years ago. Campaign mode only). Costs like $20.

The important part is that they were holding preorders for that $20 game weeks ago with a free preorder bonus that included a special skin for your online character. This skin was of a character from the older game, [Ghost](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/files/2020/03/MW2R_UDT_Bundle_Preview.jpg)

Now you may think this info is retarded but hear me out. I been playing the shit outa modern warfare for the past two weeks and literally EVERYONE has this skin on.

2020-05-04 20:36:32,StoneHolder28,3,Went on a shopping spree of calls and puts today to try to get back the third of my portfolio I lost on Friday. Then I might try to feed into more long AOBC calls because firearms sales are going to a) recover b) recover faster from a second wave c) probably rise before elections or d) all of the above.

Elon said his companies stock price is too high. Today retail was buying Tesla. 

The Fed thinks the economy is in serious danger. But today, and the last four or five weeks, retail has been buying stocks with little regard to fundamentals.
