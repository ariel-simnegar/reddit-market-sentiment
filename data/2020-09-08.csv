2020-09-09 09:24:56,CptTonyStark,25,"In 2012, Knight Capital was the largest trader in U.S. equities with a market share of around 17 percent on the NYSE and Nasdaq.

On  August 1, 2012, a flawed trading algo sent Knight on a buying spree, snapping up 154 different stocks at a total cost of around $7 billion, all in the first hour of trading.

Under stock exchange rules, Knight would have been required to pay for those shares three days later. However, they didn't have the funds so the only alternatives were to have the trades canceled, or to sell them on the same day.

Knight tried to get the  trades canceled but the SEC refused. Rules were established after the  “flash crash” of May 2010 to govern when trades should be canceled.  Knight’s buying binge did not drive up the price of 148/154 of the  purchased stocks by >30%, the cancellation threshold. Knight had no choice but to sell off the stocks it had bought.

Goldman Sachs stepped in to buy Knight’s entire unwanted position which resulted in a loss of $461.1 million in 1 hour for Knight Capital, roughly as much as the profit they had made over the previous 2 years.

Knight's stock price dropped 32% on August 1 and 63% on August 2.

Even the biggest market makers can vanish in a puff of smoke, years of profits destroyed in minutes."

But not the case for credit. For credit, you need to be able to put that interest rate payment on a table every quarter. In credit market, there is a huge disconnect between fundamentals (which are showing record defaults) and valuations (sub 4% in the higher yield market). You can not ignore the disconnect in credit market.

Credit will go down first and then stocks.

TLDR: Short the high yield credit market."

2020-09-09 08:15:28,CptTonyStark,15,"On December 8, 2005, the Japanese Investment firm Mizuho securities sent an order to the Tokyo Stock Exchange to sell 1 share in the company J-COM Co., Ltd. for 610,000 Yen ($5100) but the person typing in the order swapped the numbers and put in an order to sell 610,000 shares for 1 Yen each. 

They frantically tried to cancel it, but the Tokyo Stock Exchange didn't let them and other firms snapped up the discount shares. By the time trading was suspended the following day, Mizuho was looking at losses of 27 billion Yen ($200 million). Nikkei fell 1.95% that day and the Tokyo District court put some of the blame on the Tokyo Stock Exchange because their system did not allow Mizuho to cancel the erroneous order.

Even big investment firms fat finger orders. The guy who put the order in was probably overworked and sleep deprived (don't ask me how I know this)."

2020-09-09 06:37:38,SolitaryEgg,33,"PSA: I don't even say this as a jab. If you've been ""buying the dip"" for the past 5 days because of ""the printer"" and ""stonks go up"" and ""3 red days are illegal"" and whatnot, you are literally trading on memes. It's not good.

When I first started trading, I fucked up. I overestimated my knowledge, and I burned 23k in 3 months. I was 23, and it was like half of my net worth. But instead of getting mad or yolo revenge trading, I stopped. I took a bunch of online courses and read a bunch of books. Like 6 months later, I deposited again and made back all my losses (and then some).

The past 5 months were good. You could just buy tech calls and make free money. But those days are over. For the love of god, you *have* to stop trading on WSB memes. You'll be alright, but stop and take a breather. Focus on education. Trading can be very lucrative, but not when you truly believe things like ""RSI is a meme and crayons are for autists"" and ""stonks only go up."" 

Do. Not. Revenge. Trade. I literally cannot say this strongly enough. Whatever money you lost is gone. It's not ""invested"" towards a reversal. It's fucking gone.

Just learn and move forward."

For the past 5 days, they buy buy buy and then get fucking *dumped on.* And futures are like 100x leverage, so these aren't small potatoes. Even basic bitch retail traders could easily see a $50k investment go to $1k in minutes in a dump like that.

What I don't understand is like... why do they keep trying? The markets are a bull market like 95% of the time, why the fuck do bulls keep obsessively trying to catch falling knives? 95% wins aren't good enough? You just *need* that other 5%, too?

So the apartment next to mine theres this really old dude , idk how old cuz hes been saying 72 for the past 4 years. Sticks to himself mostly , no kids nothing hes on govt money. So he comes knocking 3 weeks ago asks for an ambulance so I call them, they come get him. Idk what happened but he comes back 5 days later. A week after that I guess the hospital or wtvr came for a ""wellness check"" (walls are thin that's how I know that part and this next part). So I don't hear shit from his room for a couple days like nothing, no tv, footsteps, nada. Decide to go knocking today , no answer. Called the landlord and hes like just see if the doorknob turns n walk in see if hes even there. I do it , walk through n there he is in his bed mouth n eyes open dead. I call 911 n these fucking geniuses go ""how do you know hes dead?"" Bitch I am sure that's not normal skin color hes not breathing. She follows up with a ""ok this is what I need you to do to help him"" and I say ""im not touching him"" and she goes ""don't you want to help?"" and I go ""what do you want me to do?"" and she says ""I need you to lay him down on the floor on his back."" and I actually go closer to him and im like wtf am I doing?(not outloud) and then I tell her ""im not touching a dead guy just send an ambulance with doctors"". They get here and yeah hes been dead for a couple days , spoke to the cops and everything . No next of kin , nada. Did not expect to have to get that up close and personal with a dead guy when I woke up today.

We're hearing all about a rotation out of tech and into reopen stocks, but is the market really ready for that?  Airlines / hotels / cruises / events are still fucked for at least another year.  They run on thin margins.  And they've already recovered a lot from their COVID lows.  

There's no logic to an airline stock coming back to retest its ATH.  Tech blasted through ATH's despite having no earnings growth in 2020.  Meanwhile, Gold and Silver have never seen better conditions.  Zero interest rates, Fed printer trying to single handedly fight off the worst recession of all time.  Price/earnings ratios on stocks through the roof.  

If you're jumping out of tech, why throw your money at an airline that is losing money hand over fist?  Why not throw it into Gold and let JPow print your ass a Lambo?"

I still think the MM's were trying to send weekly options OTM hard rather than suddenly getting bearish. Another possibility people haven't floated around enough is that banks are going to report terrible 3Q's as nothing is on accrual and they're not replacing maturing loans.

It’s called market manipulation and the Chinese and those controlled by the Chinese (see also: SoftBank) are likely behind it because they don’t want Trump to win re-election. If I’m wrong, fine. But I’ve been thinking  for two weeks now that a planned crash is coming to go with the rest of the crap that they’ve drummed up this year. This run up was nothing more than an attempt to trigger a sell off that in turn triggers an auto-trading flash crash, that with everything going on, degenerates into a free fall stopped only by suspension of trading. Which of course will make everyone panic more. Gonna be a fun fall, bois!

**We’ve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app:** Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.

**We’ve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios:** If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you’re in a short position due to an early assignment.

**We’re making buying power easier to understand:** We've begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we’ll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation."

2020-09-09 05:03:05,seancarr181,9,This drop we've had already surpassed June 8th. I don't see more than a 10% drop from SPY. We're almost there. The June 8th drop was a correction followed by a small rally and some consolidation. If I'm not mistaken this is when the Kangaroo market was born. The Fed has printed too hard to let this shit mega crash. The bleeding is almost done. But don't expect some crazy bull run ASAP. Theta will crush you. Also I don't know anything and I'm probably completely wrong.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill himself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. 

Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."

I initially invested in Tesla in late June and the plan was to hold thru battery day in anticipation of a big rise throughout. Going in I had a number I would get out of if Tesla reached it before battery day, and of course, it hit that number last Monday. I probably was as close to selling as anyone could get without actually selling, but because battery day was just a couple weeks away I thought it would be better to just see this thru until then. Boy I could not have been more wrong. I lost all the unrealized gains I had made (50k) in a week, and am now actually down 7k of my initial 66k investment. I'm feeling pretty fucking down, but gotta keep it moving man. One fucking day I'll make it. One fucking day."

Main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

S&P can't go down by design! This is why they will never allow scams like Tesla in.

No matter what happens only companies that make money are allowed in SPY.

By Friday I was down to $150 after buying SPY puts then switching to SQ calls on Weds 😪.

I put it all into 0DTE Apple $120 calls on Friday when it dipped.

Ended the day with $660.

Bought SPCE 9/11 $18 calls at open today with that $660.

Sell them for $2,000 by 11:30.

Roll those profits into 30 SPCE 9/18 $20 calls a little later and 5 DKNG 9/11 $40 calls.

I loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies.
I pray to Shrek every night, thanking him for the life I’ve been given. “Shrek is love” I say, “Shrek is life.""
My dad hears me and calls me a ******. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Shrek.
I called him a cunt.
He hits me and sends me to sleep.
I'm crying now and my face hurts.
I lay in bed, really cold. I feel something warm...
It's Shrek! I was so happy.
He whispers in my ear ""This is my swamp.""
He grabs me with his ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready.
I spread my ass cheeks for Shrek.
He penetrates my butthole.
It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering.
I want to please Shrek.
He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love.
My dad walks in.
Shrek looks him straight in the eye and says,
""It's all ogre now.""

2020-09-09 01:04:01,lacasabatlot,1,"OPINION: with average p/e's of 30+ future year earnings and contraction in U.S. GDP growth i think everyone knew the market was detached from fundamentals for quite some time

but stonks in the short term are an index of confidence (or the perception of other's confidence) in the real economy's ability to recover. Belief in the stimulus package, a vaccine,  the idea that even in a non-contact world tech companies can still kill or even exceed their current trajectory of growth - see AMZN, ZM, etc.- and a Trump election propelled the market to extreme bullishness.

But bullishness reaches a frenzy, a bacchanalic lizard-brain  party of debauched revelry with no fear of tomorrow that when it reaches its climax, corrects harshly and fast with a hangover.

The bulls on here are SEVERELY underestimating the significance of the SoftBank thing and what a big red flag it is. When someone is making trillions of  dollars of speculative leveraged bets on already all time highs in a market where the real economy is contracting, a huge psychological realization of ""has bullishness gone too far"" gets asked 

and once the question is asked, it's too late. people are no longer thinking with their emotional lizard brains, they're thinking rationally. And as previously stated, this bull market has not been rational. A feeling of trepidation and anxiety sets in, and the steadily accrued gains over a month get cut with jagged red knife red candles in 3 days. 

What does this mean going forward? The bullishness that still exists here and in the market  is just a denial of current momentum/sentiment and a desire to keep vested interests safe. There is no rationale or fundamentals underlying it in the same way there is for the bears, its just people trying to win a tug of war for the sake of tendies. As such, as happened today, there wasn't even a dead cat bounce, just a painful walk down some big bear flags.

If your entire portfolio was built on the bullish group psychology of ""stonks only go up"" you really need to ask yourself if you have any other thesis or event that will pump them and regain momentum, or if you're just clinging to this mentality when it has already withered and died.

Even if bulls manage to prevent a complete collapse, the best you can hope for for this ENTIRE MONTH is flatness. 

tl;dr: the party is over and best you can hope for is a flat as a cup september, either go theta gang or take your hands off the wheel until the dust settles."

Yes I already laid down my position and if you all pile in it would help but almost sure it will work either way.  

RH - Restoration Hardware reports tomorrow (mkt close).  Regardless of what you think of the company it’s a quarantine stock and it’s up over 100% for the year.  And even if they report fuck-you numbers the trend for all most of these stocks (home improvement) is to plummet right after they report.  Check these out, most reported solid numbers and still plummeted after earnings.... William Sonoma, At Home, FND, Pier 1, Kirk, LL, even fucking HD.  (Yes Warfare is the exception however they reported ZM type #’s).  Go check my data or check it out in the morning - Lovesac reposts in the am bet they will report solid #’s and mostly then trend downwards.  

I’d be glad to hear any rebuttals and if you throw a put or two at it and you print then you owe me an idea."

A balanced portfolio with hedging techniques is obviously the best damage control in advance a person can use."

2020-09-08 22:36:32,noentic,11,"## Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 8th, 2020 - 

## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&P 500 fell 2.8% on Tuesday in a broad-based retreat led by the mega-cap stocks. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 4.1% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) and Russell 2000 (-2.0%) declined closer to 2.0%. 
* Today's selling was largely a continuation of last week, but unlike Friday, buyers appeared unwilling to buy the dip. Apple (AAPL 112.82, -8.14, -6.7%) and Tesla (TSLA 330.21, -88.11, -21.1%), which led the market on the way up, led the market lower today, with Tesla shareholders discontent that the S&P 500 Index Committee snubbed the stock from the benchmark index. 
* Tesla's 21% decline was a drag on the Nasdaq, while Apple's 7% decline pressured the large-cap indices and the S&P 500 information technology sector (-4.6%). The energy (-3.7%) and financials (-2.6%) sectors followed suit amid weaker oil prices ($36.76/bbl, -2.94, -7.4%) and lower Treasury yields, while the utilities sector (-0.6%) declined the least. 
* Besides concerns that the market's pullback had more room to go, investors had to contend with Democratic leadership rebuffing the Senate's $300 billion coronavirus relief bill, President Trump suggesting disincentives for U.S. companies to outsource jobs to China, and reports that China's largest semiconductor foundry could be added to a trade blacklist.
* The prospect of potential retaliation on U.S. semiconductor companies was an additional drag on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.7%). Separately, Boeing (BA 161.08, -9.97, -5.8%) provided a disappointing update, saying 787 Dreamliner production problems have slowed the pace of deliveries. 
* There were some notable winners, though. Nikola (NKLA 50.05, +14.50, +40.8%) and General Motors (GM 32.38, +2.38, +7.9%) formed a strategic partnership that was well-received by investors. Walt Disney (DIS 134.20, +2.21, +1.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank. 
* U.S. Treasuries saw increased buying interest amid the decline in equities but closed off highs. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.8% to 93.46. Oil prices were pressured by Saudi Aramco lowering its prices for buyers in Asia and the U.S. due to sluggish demand. 
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index and the JOLTS - Job Openings report for July on Wednesday.

In fact, the yield curve has steepened significantly with yields from the 10 to 30 years sharply higher than the short end at this point. A non-inverted yield curve that is signaling some normalization of inflation is a bullish indicator for stocks, especially at extremely low levels, which is supportive of a ""move higher"". This looks like a big head fake to shake out some junior traders, and the real money should be coming back later in the week. Maybe the markets move lower from here, maybe they head higher – all I know is the conditions aren't right for a crash right now, so it is better to keep the gas pedal going"

if ur a bull u should be happy for green. if ur a bear u should also be happy for this super green. im a bull but this feels like an euphoric blow off the top to me. kinda like from january to february before it all came down. markets usually get a blow off the top super green for a couple of weeks before it crashes.

during that wednesday euphoric 2% pump before it all came crashing down. i swear i make the right calls, but i literally dont follow my gut and inverse myself cause i trade too much. overtrading cause u feel like u need to have a play every single day is bad. sometimes its good to sit cash gang to see how things play out."

There was a man who hated his life and decided to long $Rope. He hung the noose. Got the chair. Stepped up. Put his head through the noose. 

Then he saw a joint.

He said “fuck it” got down, lit the joint, and took a hit.

He gets back up. Puts his head back through the noose. And right as he’s about to step off he sees a bottle of vodka.

So he says “fuck it”. Steps down and takes a shot of vodka.

Gets back up. Puts his head back through the noose.

And he sees a baggy of blow.

So he gets down and does a line. 

And as it hits he thinks to himself, you know what,

Life’s not so bad"

News flash: tomorrow doesnt have to be green. We could wake up to the VIX up 15% and SPY at 330. Then, it could just fucking slide. Like all day. We wouldnt even get a CB2 until 293ish and it's not like everything is fine. It's not. Buying the dip isn't a science, it's a gamble.
