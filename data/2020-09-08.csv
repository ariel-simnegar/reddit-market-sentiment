2020-09-09 09:54:13,Soon2beonthestreet,5,"Moves for today? Looking like a day to go long, the sun is out, the birds are chirping and tech is zooming. 

My levels I'm looking at 3346, 3329 and 3290. Above 3346 = 0dte 339 calls for a morning rally and some 9/11 VXX puts on any pull backs that doesn't break 3346

If 3346 is tested and rejected = average down on above plays

3346 fails = Will still hold VXX but flip calls into 332p"

Don't forget you took a -21% on TSLA yday, so its going to take more than 7% little bitch ass pump to get back to bull territory."
