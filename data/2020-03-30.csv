Tldr; Yes the Fed basically increases the money supply with QE. But, it doesn‚Äôt cause hyper-inflation because:
- there are deflationary pressures counter acting it
- the money is used by banks to shore up reserves, and isn‚Äôt just dumped into the economy
- the Fed takes on assets from the banks in exchange, so it‚Äôs a net-zero operation in that sense"
