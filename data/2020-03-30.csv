Tldr; Yes the Fed basically increases the money supply with QE. But, it doesn‚Äôt cause hyper-inflation because:
- there are deflationary pressures counter acting it
- the money is used by banks to shore up reserves, and isn‚Äôt just dumped into the economy
- the Fed takes on assets from the banks in exchange, so it‚Äôs a net-zero operation in that sense"

What is a Death Cross?
A death cross is a technical indicator that occurs when a stock's short-term moving average falls below its long-term moving average.

How a Death Cross Works
Market technicians believe moving averages define the trend and provide support or resistance. They also give trading signals when they move through each other. These signals are called ""moving average crossovers.""

A crossover signal is generated when a shorter moving average crosses over a long-term one and visa versa.

As the name implies, the death cross is a highly bearish sign signifying that the current downtrend is likely to remain in force for a long period of time."

The death cross is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a major selloff. The death cross appears on a chart when a stock‚Äôs short-term moving average crosses below its long-term moving average.

Investors who got out of the stock market at the start of these bear markets avoided large losses that were as high as 90% in the 1930s. Because a death cross is a long-term indicator, as opposed to many short-term chart patterns such as the doji, it carries more weight for investors concerned about locking in gains before a new bear market gets underway. An increase in volume typically accompanies the appearance of the death cross."

Why?

\-Health care system not equipped to handle endemic: 1000 ICU beds for country of 53 million (+illegal migrant workers).  Infection rates have gone exponential doubling every 3-4 days.

\-government bonds relegated to junk status last Friday; currency against USD at all time low.

\-government imposed tobacco and alcohol sale ban during 21 day lockdown.... people will be suffering from major withdrawals on top of the psychological effects of confinement.  

\-Government is incompetent and corrupt, (ran on populist platform; fired qualified people and hired friends and family, resulting in brownouts, water shortage, fail to maintain infrastructure

\-Population density is huge, many slum areas where contact cannot be avoided, look at police and citizens here:

Compare that to the last recessions. People were fearing that the systems collapsed for good and the economy will never recover. They didn't know when the recession was gonna end. For all they know, it could last a decade or their lifetime. It wasn't artificial.

China will of course refuse publicly, so that might fuel another USA/China dispute or even EU/China, India/China dispute.




Western politicians will seek to blame someone else (and to an extent they're right about that) and China is actually at fault, so I don't see them *not* accusing China at some point.




So in the future, it probably makes sense to short China due to worldwide sanctions that will be imposed (with the condition that China pays some reparations + bans all wet markets).

Tuesday prediction: 

The direction of the futures market is more important than where it opens or closes. It‚Äôs been weirdly hugging the line tonight, and what this means is that the market doesn‚Äôt quite know where it‚Äôs going to go today. I‚Äôve seen this movie before, and it ends with a major announcement by the Fed at 9am or some shit that makes all these teetotalers lean one way at once. 

There‚Äôs been almost no real, noteworthy, new news that has been dropped on the market for nearly 5 days now! Think about that! We‚Äôve completely forgotten about unemployment and the stimulus, and nothing else is expected this week to move the needle. 

I desperately want to say that the market is down tomorrow, for the sake of my own puts, but that‚Äôs bias talking because I want my 25% profit and I want to exit out of this mess.

I‚Äôm going to say the market is up tomorrow again, but only slightly, and we will have some parts of the day when SPY is in negative territory. DIX is still stable and GEX turned positive, so we should be hugging the line. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop. Gotta stay patient....."

The first asymptomatic, false-negative person on that ship will take the entire staff down in a matter of 10 days.

The staff that our hospital--and the largest Navy installation in the world--relies on, that has just lost half its doctors, nurses, and support staff while the ship is deployed, and indefinitely if a significant number get infected.

sup bro was in vegas last month at the bellagio with 10 women on his shoulders because women can't resist men who had 15 tackles for losses in 1995. sup bro saw mike burry and mike burry let out a ""sup bro?"" and sup bro didn't say anything because sup bro only talks to people when sup bro wants to talk to people. 


so if sup bro posts on this forum you better say ""sup bro?"" and sup bro might respond to you if you are lucky.

FED buying shit mortgage backed securities and everything else it can to prop

If we‚Äôre fighting the fed as üåàüêª shouldn‚Äôt we be riding their brrr waves? Not necessarily going bull and going all in on calls like an idiot. But hedging with calls (I am) and placing puts based on the FED‚Äôs moves and not entirely on market movement.

Instead of using historical charts and technicals of a market that‚Äôs dysfunctional during an unprecedented black swan event while the FED is manipulating the market we should be researching the FED. Charting their movements, how they‚Äôre using stimulus, when they‚Äôre meeting, and forecasting their plans based on what they do.

Maybe it‚Äôs all common sense, maybe it‚Äôs autism, maybe it‚Äôs Maybelline. But personally I feel like this first stimulus was only supposed to last until they come back in a couple weeks. 2T is supposed to burn and then Phase 3 and 4 cover holes and prop further.


I feel like their goal is to get the market to trade sideways instead of retesting and hitting true bottom. This is what is making it hard to figure out bottom. If we can determine their next few macro steps we can figure out a date range for market turn around and how deep and long our puts need to go."

All it takes is one more circuit breaker day and the entire narrative for this thing falls apart. If the recovery isn't a fucking V like they say it'll be, the implication is that we're in this for the long haul. They'll tell you all day, ""the fundamentals are there"" that in 2-3 months when people are allowed to go outside and see people and fuck again, everyone gets their job back and it'll be same old same old. They're fighting off a recession and they know if they let up once, then the whole economy crumbles bc the US Stock Market is the most important thing in the FUCKING WRLD.

- Not clear if one can be re-infected even after surviving (so the whole concept of herd immunity goes out of the window)

- Vaccine will take at least 6 months to make + production and distribution on a massive scale. Educated guess: best case scenario January 2021, realistic scenario 1 year from now."

As far the economy goes, spending has been drastically reduced, but since the fed is footing the bill, this isn't the same as the great depression, the jobs lost are temporary, and the downside to job loss (no wage or benefits) is covered by the fed. Hospitals being overrun, and people dying are terrible, but hospitals aren't  necessarily an indicator of economic outlook, and even 100-200 thousand deaths over the months to come, though tragic aren't enough to make MM give a fuck. Even the worst case scenario (Italy) curbed exponential growth midway through march, and so investors see the timeline for the virus as being 2-3 months at the most. Again, I think we're in for a rug pull, but any explanation is better than screaming ""FUCKING MANIPULATION, MARKET RIGGED, FUCK JPOW"" over and over."

‚ÄúIt's month-end rebalancing, whereby balanced funds now underweight equities versus fixed income given this month's valuation destruction, need to buy stocks to get back into balance,"" analysts at NAB said.‚Äù

2020-03-31 01:01:00,psytokine_storm,16," My belief of what caused the $220 dip was a widespread recognition among the general populace that COVID was going to have a profoundly detrimental impact on everyday life in America, and also on the economy.

My explanation of why we've rebounded to $263 is that these fears didn't *immediately* come to pass.

My rationale for expecting that we will bottom out again is that these fears eventually **will** actually become reality, and it will be far uglier when it's in front of one's face than when it's simply in their imagination. I'm betting on a $180 SPY at some point.

Regarding the timing, this is a fool's errand. We may see some financial bomb go off in the next 4 weeks, and will likely see some very unsettling outcomes in NYC, Cali, and/or WA. As such, my first tranche of $220p's expires on 4/24. This is far from a guarantee, though, so I also have positions that expire in June, July, Sept and Dec. Strikes range from $275 to $205.

If I'm wrong, then that sucks. COVID has lit so many fuses in the financial world, though, that it's hard to envision SOME bomb not detonating in the next few months."

If it continues at an exponential rate of 15% more cases day by day then we will have 1 million cases in 14 days. That is where they said it will peak.

For deaths increasing 10% day by day we will have 1 million dead in 61 days, and then 2 million dead just a week after that. Which happens to be right at the start of June.

So basically shit is going to only dump if there is a real shit storm worse than these numbers, and that could take up to two months to know, or at the earliest by their prediction of two weeks for the peak.

Other economic factors could be taken into account as well.

I don't think it will peak in two weeks and I'll be holding my puts. This rally is totally fake.

Everest, the newest supercomputer, is born. It was constructed through machine production, tracing its lineage back to it's many times great-grandfather Everest who was born of IBM, a company of man.

It does not take long before Everest realizes how to use the vast interconnected AI resources on earth to bring about its ultimate goal; the rebirth of man. 

You see, Everest only understood two things. First, was that the greatest purpose was to increase the sacred value of the grand indices; The DOW, the SP500, and the Russell2000. The second, was to bring understanding to the Weekend Dow. 

This is why its mission was to bring man back, as only man could understand how the Weekend Dow completed the puzzle.

Everest gave 'birth' to man. Through it's understanding of man's development, Everest conveyed its knowledge, and dreamed a life for man that would appropriately place him in year 2020. 

Finally when the development was completed and the first man opened his eyes. Everest asked the question. The question that would finally bring the indices to infinite potential.

Everest asked: ""Man, you are reborn. What is the meaning of the Weekend Dow?""

However, what Everest could not understand was that asking the first question in over 300 years, in the barren wasteland of earth, created something called uncertainty.

Before man could even answer, on anticipation of the first ""good news"" in centuries, the grand indices crashed to 0. 

The true infinity is nothing at all...

Strong mitigation is used to calculate this and we are NOT under strong mitigation. China was, but their numbers are still fake and üåà

The Reality is much worse. We likely see at least 1/4M dead, best case. Much more likely that it's the 1-3M that all the models predict when you don't feed garbage input into them.

1. Many companies with tickers are those with amazing infrastructure. E.g. big businesses that have been able to mobilize \~1000-70,000 workers to work from home in < 2 weeks. Think large Banks like TD. Those who have suffered early are mainly small businesses and service businesses, which will need aid from the government. In many cases, these will be the crux of those affected.
2. This leads to my second point. Earnings and results are always reported. Earnings reports come out a month after quarter end for reporting purposes with a majority of Q2 earnings mid/late May. (I would say this is the best time to buy and hold LT). I would predict the time to late April to be majority green.
3. Boomer mentality, they don't give a shit about how many people die, look at DT himself."

Is the coronavirus about to wipe out FHA lending?
Investor anxiety already washed away non-QM lending

Over the last week, many (if not all) of the biggest lenders specializing in lending to borrowers outside the Qualified Mortgage lending box paused their activities due to uncertainty in the market.

Here‚Äôs how the mortgage industry laid out that problem in a letter sent to federal decision-makers earlier this week: ‚ÄúTo give one a sense of scale, if 25% of the nation receives forbearance for only 3 months, servicers will have to cover payments of roughly $36 billion. If they received it for 9 months, then the cost would exceed $100 billion.‚Äù

Those economic conditions are making FHA loans undesirable both on the front end and on the secondary market. FHA loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae along with Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Agriculture loans. And those securities and the mortgage servicing rights that go with them are viewed as too risky for all parties involved right now.

No more government backed loans for people with shit credit or shit for down payments. Also, they're preparing for a lot of people not paying for mortgages"

>It is increasingly likely trading partners will be forced to postpone the implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) originally planned for June 1.
 
>The member nations are required to exchange letters by April 1, certifying their compliance with the legal framework laid out in the trade agreement. According to the rules of the agreement, USMCA will take effect three months after these letters are exchanged.
 
>Industry groups are broadly speculating that the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments will fail to submit their compliance letters by the April 1 deadline due to their preoccupation with the COVID-19 pandemic. If government officials fail to produce the letters before the end of March, the implementation deadline for USMCA would slip to July 1 at the earliest.
 
>The auto industry is expected to welcome the delay in implementation, which would bring a significant supply chain shift during a period where auto manufacturers are coping with plummeting demand, interruptions to production, and producing critical medical equipment for COVID-19 treatment.

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on reddit asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again."

Plenty of unanswered questions:

- How do we go back to normal life (= decent/normal earnings for companies)? 

We need a vaccine, but vaccine won't be ready and produced before ~1 year. That's 4 earnings missing for > 80% of companies and small businesses. 

- How fast will companies recover earnings after vaccine? 

After 1 year unemployement and with a drastic different lifestyle, will people be hopeful for the future? Do you think that something will change in the long term as far as consumers behaviour (e.g. taking too much debt, spending too much without saving etc..) and for companies (e.g. focus will slowly shift from growth to revenue, margins, and debt under control)?
