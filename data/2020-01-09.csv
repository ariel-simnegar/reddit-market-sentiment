I don't even use a checking account. Or savings. I put tens of thousands into Apple at $210 thinking it would just stabilize and grow slowly. Cuz fuck bank interest and slow gains - what am I? Gay? Fuck no. Bless Tim Apple. This company is a rocket with room to go higher. For a year it's only gone in a 45 degree angle. It's hilarious because bears still exist. This company made goofy pcs 15 years ago and has since killed Nokia and the record store. They make the most popular phone ever - and all they do is re-release them with 1 new feature over and over as if they're Avengers sequels. It's amazing, retarded, and brilliant at the same time. I cant wait for iPhone 57 Pro Max. We're all gonna buy it. How? With the fucking CREDIT CARD made by the same fucking company cuz ""fuck it, lets be a bank too."" 

You're an idiot if you ain't in Apple. Think about it. Cinematic legend, autist and ping-pong retard, Forrest Gump even invested in 1994. Invested all that shrimp money in that ""fruit company"". 14,627% increase since then. He now mows lawns for 20 minutes and then fucks hookers and snorts cocaine off Jenny's grave.

Additionally, what percentage of ones portfolio are you gambling/investing/trading with?
