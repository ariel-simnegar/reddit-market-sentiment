This company made goofy pcs 15 years ago and has since killed Nokia and the record store. They make the most popular phone ever - and all they do is re-release them with 1 new feature over and over as if they're Avengers sequels. It's amazing, retarded, and brilliant at the same time. I cant wait for iPhone 57 Pro Max. We're all gonna buy it. How? With the fucking CREDIT CARD made by the same fucking company cuz ""fuck it, lets be a bank too."" 

You're an idiot if you ain't in Apple. Think about it. Cinematic legend, autist and ping-pong retard, Forrest Gump even invested in 1994. Invested all that shrimp money in that ""fruit company"". 14,627% increase since then. He now mows lawns for 20 minutes and then fucks hookers and snorts cocaine off Jenny's grave.

Leverage 1 million dollars and make a play. If it works you potentially could come away profiting FAT. 

If you happen to get GUH‚Äôd then just file for bankruptcy. 

You just have to make sure you leverage enough so that the hole you fall into if you fall is deep. It would be hard to file for bankruptcy with 20k debt to robinhood.

I see no reason the market can't hit that (Especially with AMD to $400 and AAPL to $2000 this year).

I honestly dont think we have to start talking about valuation problems until the SPX P/E is well over 100. We have the smartest president to ever have lived, and the global economy is the strongest it can be. 

Idk how you could be bearish. Every day futures are up over 0.3%,  and that can continue forever. No reason not to.

We broke the consolidation range [I cited yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elyvd1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_09/fdm38gb/) today, leaving a new gap at the former resistance (324.8). This is a bullish sign and because we had more strong AH activity, my short term top for tomorrow is 327.2 by EOD. Not much else to update otherwise. 

Indicators still suggest buying is slowing and tomorrow there's a few pieces of economic news before the open. If we meet or exceed expectations, I will again say that we should watch for a grind towards the 327.2 target. If we miss, I would expect that gap fill down to the 324.8 again. If we miss badly I would play 324.8 very cautiously because buying is still starting to show signs of slowing so we may overshoot below it.

Good luck tomorrow guys! Get those tendies."

some DD for u fucks. Goldman ain't wrong. my employer have around 15k employees and we've been using Azure since last year and moving more shits to their cloud. 

Microsoft got a good sales team. They know how to suck our CIO dick off and to be fair. MSFT have a good support team too. whenever we need help. they usually responded within two days or less.

Microsoft also have that bundle shit going on. We use Office 365 and switch off Skype for Business and use Teams. Microsoft is like Apple once they sucka you into their eco system. its really hard to pull out and good luck trying to get small/mid size owner to pay money for shits that Microsoft just good enough. 

i predicted Slack gonna get fuck Bigly in 2020 with more companies switch over to Teams. Even fortune 500 bosses ain't going to pay extra when Teams is free with Office 365.

MSFT is pretty much recession proof 'cause you gonna need software no matter what.

edit: MSFT pay for a third party company to assess our IT and see what can move into Azure. MSFT is pretty aggressive with Corporation."
