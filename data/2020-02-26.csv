2020-02-27 13:16:43,SandKey,6,"Today may be difficult for trading. With Futures being 40+ points down, do you buy puts on the S&P or calls?

If this was up 40 points, it would be an easier decision. But we're easily in an oversold condition from a technical standpoint so a lot of puts may quickly become very uncomfortable very quickly in the short term even if the markets continue to fall. 

Eventually, without fail, some of the big boys are going to swoop in for an easy payday and wipe all of the trades by mass lifting the markets by pumping and clearing the board. This will happen. So being down like this on a Thursday when a lot of people are going to be looking to close positions by the weekend is cause for second thought.  

I have a feeling that a lot of people with expiring 2/28 options might get trapped. Of course, I could be wrong. But markets opening so low usually confuses me. Especially when longer term downward momentum is most obvious."

Additionally, my friend who works in the emergency room said they are also having masks on backorder for at least 2 weeks.

EDIT: LAKE has increased only 35.7% the past 5 days while APT increased 152.34%. LAKE is a nearly guaranteed thing. The reason APT is doing so hot is they were announcing their involvement in the coronavirus outbreak in early february. This looks too fucking good to be true. I'm all in."
