2020-02-27 13:16:43,SandKey,5,"Today may be difficult for trading. With Futures being 40+ points down, do you buy puts on the S&P or calls?

If this was up 40 points, it would be an easier decision. But we're easily in an oversold condition from a technical standpoint so a lot of puts may quickly become very uncomfortable very quickly in the short term even if the markets continue to fall. 

Eventually, without fail, some of the big boys are going to swoop in for an easy payday and wipe all of the trades by mass lifting the markets by pumping and clearing the board. This will happen. So being down like this on a Thursday when a lot of people are going to be looking to close positions by the weekend is cause for second thought.  

I have a feeling that a lot of people with expiring 2/28 options might get trapped. Of course, I could be wrong. But markets opening so low usually confuses me. Especially when longer term downward momentum is most obvious."

Additionally, my friend who works in the emergency room said they are also having masks on backorder for at least 2 weeks.

EDIT: LAKE has increased only 35.7% the past 5 days while APT increased 152.34%. LAKE is a nearly guaranteed thing. The reason APT is doing so hot is they were announcing their involvement in the coronavirus outbreak in early february. This looks too fucking good to be true. I'm all in."

But from a technical perspective, we are set up extremely similar to Feb. 2018.  We dropped from 2802 on Feb 2 2018 to 2532 on Feb 9th, right around the 200 day moving average.  In 6 sessions, we had a 10% sell off.  We bounced off that 200 day moving average to back to 2732 by Feb 16.

The SP500 200 day moving average is around 3044. Many technicians really value that line. We are going to be extremely over sold if we get down to 3044 as we will likely see a bounce.

But who knows, maybe ""this time it's different""."

Please help me find the bear who made tender but firm  love to me, my finances and my future this afternoon.  About 26 years old.  She said she was at a long-short fund in Greenwich.  Graduated Harvard college (Elliot House) and did two years in JPM's IBD analyst program (industrials) before moving buyside.  But her heart was never in it and she did finance recruiting because she didn't know what else to do.  You could tell she was just going through the motions as she had her way with me.

Wasn't hot in the face, but had a body you could tell was going to stay tight into 30s and 40s.

 A recap of what went down at the Trump Presser as per [Amanda Holepuncher:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-us-response)

* Vice-president Mike Pence will lead and coordinate the US‚Äôs response to the coronavirus.
* Trump said the risk to Americans is ‚Äúvery low‚Äù but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn‚Äôt think is inevitable.
* Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC said authorities should ‚Äúdust off‚Äù their pandemic preparedness plans. ‚ÄúThe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.‚Äù
* Secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, says ‚Äúwe can expect to see more cases in the US‚Äù, and while containment is working, ‚Äúthe degree of risk can change quickly‚Äù.
* 15 cases of coronavirus in the US, as well as three cases from Americans repatriated from Wuhan and 42 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
* Trump says of the 15, eight have returned home, five have fully recovered, one is in hospital, and one is about to go home.
* Trump defended the low testing rate in the US (fewer than 500 so far).
* Trump said the illness was ‚Äúlike the flu‚Äù, except with far fewer deaths, and people just need to exercise usual hygiene measures like washing their hands. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll essentially have a flu shot for this in a very quick manner.‚Äù
* The National Institute of Health said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so will not help this current outbreak, but may assist a seasonal return. The answer right now is containment.
* Trump said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the right time‚Äù to extend travel restrictions to other affected countries like Italy and South Korea.

It's become pretty clear that Trumps attempt to pump only made things worse. 1 new US case of  Covid-19 that is ""unexplained"" also drove futures down. Germany has basically said that it is in ""pandemic"" mode since it can no longer trace cases of the disease, which leads me to think that this is probably the case in a lot of countries whether they want to admit it or not.

These are extension targets from our all time high at 3397.5 to tuesday's lows. 

1st level is \~3051 and the next extension target after that is 3010 which brings us all the way down to pre-notQE levels. This 3010-3020 area is also where we find our first major support level from July and September. If we even reach the 3051 level, we are in full correction mode. If we break past the \~3020, then holy fuck we have a long way to drop."

2020-02-27 00:56:32,knotswag,55,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

[We breached below 312.5 today](https://imgur.com/TcnRSzP) so 310 (gold line) is imminent, and as I've said before, represents completion of the correction based on my crayons. This would actually coincide fairly well with /NQ futures, which is currently red but right around a strong support, [which it would reach with a little nudge downwards during tomorrow's trading session or tonight.](https://imgur.com/ioBHG4X) If you want the exact number it's technically ~309.5 before Feb 28.

If 309.5 goes, the next support is at 304.7. Again, there's many reasons why I think 309-310 is going to be it, but the most important is just that this current drop is unsupported by actual economic data. Most recessions/major shifts in the market has come about because of an economic indicator, and though some of the FAANG's cutting guidance would be of concern, I basically think that we have way more room to drop and it won't happen just yet. All that being said, others with their own charts have said 304.7 (some have said 303) would be where they expect the market to actually reverse, so just let that be known for your own trading. I myself will probably buy calls if the market shows some buying strength around the 309.5/310 zone, or even if tomorrow starts showing substantial strong movement (i.e. gap up that breaks the green correction trendline).

That's sort of it. Take care of all your tendies and see you during the session tomorrow."

2020-02-27 00:49:39,satireplusplus,12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f8jqnd/why_sarscov2_is_not_just_the_flu/

The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a median of 3.28[1] . This is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[2] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[3] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[4] .

SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symtoms[5] . This makes it much more difficult to control.

Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[6] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[7].

Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[8] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[9] .

There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[10] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.

There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people.

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention.

It doesn't take a genius to piece it all together. This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu."

2020-02-26 23:29:45,bizmanon,2,"**Another day of blunderous mistakes of this newb...**

I suspected a morning rally today. Had bought TQQQ calls yesterday, somehow lost 30% each on them before Tuesday close. I was up today at around noon, but thought there was a little rally left (unsatisfied with my gains). I knew I needed to sell them at some point to get some cash for the afternoon sell off. I missed my opportunity. Finally cut my losses at -35%. Could have been +10% or so if I had listened to my gut.

I had also picked up SPY puts on Tuesday. All of which immediately lost value somehow, and have still yet to return. At the exact moment I decided to continue waiting for the last few TQQQ %s my puts were worth .25 each. They are now at 60 cents.

After I sold my TQQQ puts at a loss, I jumped in a different strike for SPY puts. Thinking I had just caught the reversal on the underlying chart, I pulled the trigger at 1.14 each. I didn‚Äôt realize that the price had just been squeezed up, it plummeted down to .99 within 30 seconds. On the option line chart, the minute I purchased shows .99...I really got fucked on that one. It currently sits at .92.

As long as we can plunge this support at 311, I‚Äôll be looking fine but damn it‚Äôs frustrating.

How can I literally call the movement for the day but execute so poorly? The obvious answer is letting greed/emotion get in the way of making the right decision at the right time. Another reason is that I have no technical chart plan to lean on. Another one is I feel like I‚Äôm missing the news that causes these sudden shifts. I‚Äôm glued to CNBC all day, so it‚Äôs annoying how quickly I can be left chasing the action.

Any advice other than the following?:

- Don‚Äôt trade on emotion
- Play longer dated expirations
- Get a Bloomberg terminal
- Learn TA
- Take a break"

BEAR

I saw some comments in this thread and they made me some money. So, since there will be less and less people that will go on cruise ship, today I shorted RCL and CCL. Since Disney CEO stepped down, I have shorted Disney. Disney will probably go lower because people won't go in crowd because of virus.

Today I read about airline companies will probably go even lower because people tend not to travel. EXPE is stock that I will probably short. Also, AAL, DAL and UAL, I'll pick the best to short.

BULL

GILD stock should go up. But I didn't buy it because I have read in January that the cure will be available till the end of the year and they have cure after only 2 months? I will stay away from this. I want to short this badly, because I don't believe they have a cure so fast.

So, for now, travel company stocks should drop, cruise ships and airline. What else can you put on the list and why? And is there anything I got wrong? Except I transformed into a bear because I want to make money. Stupid me."

2020-02-26 21:34:13,,8,"Guys lets be realistic here.

The Corona virus is only going to shift the demand for the products and services a month or two forward. This combined with the market pricing in the lost revenue (the recent dip) means that as soon as the companies start posting their Q1 2020 earnings the stocks are going to pump to ATH. This correction is just an overreaction to the virus (market didn't price it in before), and people looking for a reason to sell (stocks were too hot).

New cases of the virus have also started decreasing in China meaning the worst is over. (source - https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling )

The new year holiday just got extended for a week. (source https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/ ). Right now Xi is trying to get the factories back in production and considering the circumstances they're doing quite well (some provinces have 90%+ of their businesses and factories reopened) (source - https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work ). The virus hit during Chinese new years, when the factories were already shut down, and a lot of them are already back up. This means that the impact on production will not be as bad as people are predicting.

We only lost a few weeks of production (which could potentially be made up for) and a few weeks of consumer/business demand (demand will shift from Jan and Feb to March and April). Unless a companies quarter ends in March or earlier you'll be fine.

If you're calls are a few months out you'll be fine.

I might be retarded tho since I put half of my portfolio in TQQQ and the other half in QQQ June 30 $240 calls.

TL:DR - Buy long term calls (a few months out)."

**Microsoft update on Q3 FY20 guidance**

REDMOND, Wash., Feb. 26, 2020   /PRNewswire/ -- As Microsoft   closely monitors the impact of the COVID-19 health emergency, our top   priority remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners,   and communities. Our global health response team is acting to help protect   our employees in accordance with global health authorities' guidance.   Worldwide, Microsoft   employees are working to support organizations addressing the challenges on   the ground. Microsoft   also continues to make donations to relief and contamination efforts,   including directly providing technology to help hospitals and medical   workers.

On Jan. 29, as part of our second quarter of   fiscal year 2020 earnings call, we issued quarterly revenue guidance for our   More Personal Computing segment between $10.75 and $11.15   billion, which included a wider than usual range to reflect   uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.   Although we see strong Windows demand in line with our expectations, the   supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than   anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call. As a result, for the third   quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal   Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively   impacted than previously anticipated. All other components of our Q3 guidance   remain unchanged. 

&#x200B;

As the conditions evolve, Microsoft   will act to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers, and   partners during this difficult period. We will also continue to partner with   local and global health authorities to provide additional assistance. We   deeply appreciate the commitment of the people and organizations that have   united to address this health emergency; our thoughts are with all those   affected across the world."

2020-02-26 21:15:47,LessThanCleverName,5,"> On Jan. 29, as part of our second quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings call, we issued quarterly revenue guidance for our More Personal Computing segment between $10.75 and $11.15 billion, which included a wider than usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China. Although we see strong Windows demand in line with our expectations, the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call. As a result, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated. All other components of our Q3 guidance remain unchanged.

A) Why‚Äôd it take so long? B) So much for MSFT having no exposure to China."
