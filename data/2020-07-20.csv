I am genuinely curious though about the thought process of paying higher than normal premiums on the same week sometimes day as earnings? Theta buttfucking you plus the possibility of it not being a blow out earnings will cause the implied volatility to drop and along with that your option value. Isn’t money made more consistently buying 1-2 months before earnings, getting the run up then passing the bag to you guys who enjoy this?
