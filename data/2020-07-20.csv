I am genuinely curious though about the thought process of paying higher than normal premiums on the same week sometimes day as earnings?

Isn’t money made more consistently buying 1-2 months before earnings, getting the run up then passing the bag to you guys who enjoy this?

It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and some people missed it. Now they are still chasing it, thinking a rug-pull will happen. It was uncertainty that caused the drop. It is unlikely that the same big drop will happen soon, as the world has now adapted to the current situation.

If you missed the drop, there was another way to make money, which was on the way up as the outlook became more certain. But no, some people just want to be able to say they made money betting against the market, against the Fed, against the masses.

Let me explain your fight:
You're fighting against people that automatically deposit funds into their 401K and pensions without thinking about the current situation.

You're betting against the S&P 500, the top 500 U.S companies, that they will not be able to withstand the pandemic.

You're betting against the tech companies that enabled the world to function, do business and communicate.

Good luck."

They think other people will be thinking similarly and flock to these cities for the prestige and business opportunities. 

But in reality, if home prices get sufficiently high in a city relative to the income of the people who live there, and thus make it difficult to afford a decent home, people start taking a hard look at these assumptions. 

Very high home prices also create pressures for the administration and eventually there is an increase in supply of homes in the glamorous cities too. Thus in these cities, home prices are highly volatile but show little long term trend."

2020-07-21 06:33:32,CptTonyStark,9,"Housing prices in the US have been mostly flat/slightly declining from 1890-2020, with all the increase in just 2 periods: right after WW2, and early 2000s (reflecting a lagged response to the stock market boom of the late 90s). 

The overall increase in inflation adjusted home prices is ~50% in the last 130 years (~0.3% a year).

The reason people “believe” that housing prices appreciate considerably is because most people buy houses every 20-30 years. The same thing does not happen with stocks. People do not have long run comparisons thrust upon them with stocks as with houses."

Post earnings it will stall a bit and wait for Square to also do well on earnings. Investors will extrapolate SQ cr\*pto growth and put it to $205 valuation.

Tesla isn't going to pass 2300 this week nor will it pass 3500 next week. Am I missing something here or is this an easy $600?

2020-07-21 02:36:08,CptTonyStark,6,"Housing prices in the US steadily declined from 1890 to 1940. 

In the late 1800s, there were local bubbles surrounding the building of highways, canals, railroads, etc. 

House prices fell sharply after WWI due to the influenza pandemic which infected 28% of Americans and killed 675k. This epidemic causes people to stay at home and not look for new homes. 

There was no boom in home prices to accompany the sharply rising stock market of the Roaring 20s, although there was a Local housing Bubble in Florida. 

Home prices didn’t fall once the stock market bubble burst in 1929. Nominal home prices fell just as much as CPI during the Great Depression, but inflation adjusted home prices remained stable. 

In early 1930s, mortgage debt was not indexed to inflation which gave homeowners negative equity in their homes an incentive to default on their mortgages."

When in history did a stock with 33,300% more insider selling then purchasing, two months before a circuit breaker open following a 50% pump, lead one to believe there’s still juice left in this dog shit of a stock?

They’re even saying that a short squeeze is due. First of all why does stocktwits always make fun of shorts? It’s literally free money for penny stocks and pharma stocks. Second, do they not read days to cover and realize that the shorts already covered today?

Thesis all along has been that we'd run tomorrow and Wednesday all day into the bell. Plan is to ride that wave and sell it sometime Wednesday afternoon. 

And yet...

When I'm taking a dump, or eating breakfast, or taking a shower - quiet moments when my mind can drift off - all I imagine is telling everyone I know that I sold it, I took the $20k gainer ... and then holding that MFer and waking up Thursday to a $60k payday.

2020-07-21 01:51:22,NationalMarsupial7,21,"Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

SNAP is about to pay off big. Almost 10% shorted and they are nearing all time highs, which was the IPO price (\~$27). They are resembling the path FB took post IPO (minus the instant profit), until people finally realized the potential. Their DAU has been growing month over a month (and could see a surge internationally in places like India who have banned tiktok), and ad revenue and average revenue per user continues to increase. Q1 numbers: DAU increased by 20%; Q1 revenue up 44% compared to Q1 2019 39%, and posted its first ever + op cash flow. Currently up almost 200% over the last three months.

""*Snap has slowly improved its ad-based offerings and marketers are now falling in love with what it calls an “unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience.” The social media company that still refers to itself as “a camera company” claims that in the U.S. it reaches “more than 90% of 13 to 24 year-olds and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year-olds*.” [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-snap-stock-earnings-coronavirus-233311765.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-snap-stock-earnings-coronavirus-233311765.html)

Their dynamic advertising platform is unique and still flying under the radar. They have the foothold in AR technology, lenses, and are a leader in creative advertising options such as first viewed ad upon open or designing ads for several campaigns which has been made easy through their app integrations. Market sentiment on SNAP has always been shitty due to FB and twitter, but I think they recovered beautifully and have positioned themselves extremely well."

“A lot”? More limited in how it can be used, doesn’t carry the same aesthetic grace.

“Significantly”? An abomination of a word. Not only does it overstay it’s welcome in any sentence unfortunate enough to include it, but it also has an inescapably academic tone, making it dissonant in any casual conversation.

“Very”? Not a direct comparison since it does not function the same syntactically, but it does communicate a similar meaning. I’ll admit, this word does have a wonderful sonic profile, but by virtue of its delicate pronunciation, it fails to carry the same emotional force."

The Nasdaq-100, however, was super strong. 79% of its stocks finished up on the day
Davis points out that the six stocks trade at 36 times earnings and six times sales, the latter the highest on record. “The law of diminishing returns suggests that the larger a company is, the harder it is to keep compounding high growth rates to justify these valuations,” Davis writes.
Davis is quick to point out that he is not calling a top. The six big stocks can continue hitting new highs if the rest of the market follows along. So far that hasn’t been the case.

Tl;dr: money isnt flowing into nq as much as it's flowing up to the top six which is a bubble indicator."

So you can think that “stocks only go up” forever but that’s just not true. When we’re having 2% or 3% daily moves these are rare times. Just enjoy this shit because it doesn’t happen that often and before you know it we’ll be in the doldrums of .4% moves daily and grinding bullshit days with weekly moves of maybe 2%.

Where's the upside if there's a rotation out of value stocks and people are chasing tech again? There's no reopening news because we're locking down again, there's no vaccine news, no earnings news, the only hope this market has is new stimulus...if there can be a bipartisan agreement, it gets passed and into the hands of the people in a timely manner.

2020-07-21 00:04:44,aryalmuskan17,3,"Like I said in my previous comment, I'm really liking BJs as a potential earnings play, depending how they run up towards their earnings on 8/20.
Last Q they absolutely blew away earnings estimates by showing increased membership during the start of the pandemic. 
Last Q they were projected .37 EPS and hit it out of the ballpark with a .69 EPS(nice), and they noted that people going out and stocking up on supplies helped significantly. 
Q2 was the heart of the pandemic as we all know, and in the 16 states that BJs has 210+ locations, have been hit pretty hard during covid. Since they are a budget grocery store, many people are signing up to help save money and buy items in bulk. 

""BJ's stock has continued to gain in July as a resurgence in coronavirus cases makes it likely that the company will see elevated demand. Grocery sales have remained high in May and June, rising about 10% from a year ago. 

The pandemic also gives BJ's an opportunity to increase its membership and therefore the efficiency of its warehouses. Membership income growth was much stronger than in the first quarter a year ago, a sign that the crisis is spurring new membership. Growth in its membership base is key as it would provide a long-term benefit to the company, assuming members stay with the club.""-[motley fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/09/why-bjs-wholesale-club-jumped-64-in-the-first-half.aspx) 

 ""During the day the stock fluctuated 1.99% from a day low at $39.61 to a day high of $40.40. The price has risen in 9 of the last 10 days and is up by 9.1% over the past 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in total, 54 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In total, 1 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $48.70 million.

BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 46.28% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $54.29 and $67.74 at the end of this period."" [stock invest article](https://stockinvest.us/technical-analysis/BJ)

I have a strong belief that BJ continued to see membership increases during Q2 and will again beat estimates of .56 EPS. 

BJs Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) Price Target Raised to $45.00 at Loop Capital[article from July 8th](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-bj-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/)

TLDR: BJ destroy earnings, BJ 40c 8/21 for the run up, going to snag some 45 9/18 and some 50c 9/18"

Maybe his company is currently over-valued, but these boomers are missing a pretty obvious global trend over the last few years if they think his success makes ""no sense"". Every industry in the world is more and more personality driven, as a symptom of the social media age. Many sports fans now follow players, not teams. Fans of fashion or music or whatever learn about trends from individual analysts or critics, not big magazines. Why would the stock market be spared from this personality-driven trend? The question isn't when will Musk go away; it's when will more Musks appear. What stocks are going to blow up because their figurehead is a big personality?"

Even amazon play down the hype that their model will benefit greatly from covid generated business.

Skew refers to downside protection, aka fear of extreme events or black swan events in the markets. It gained +3.61% today and still way above February levels!

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-SKEW/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-SKEW/)

>The SKEW index is calculated using S&P 500 options that measure tail risk — returns two or more standard deviations from the mean — in S&P 500 returns over the next 30 days. The primary difference between the VIX and the SKEW is that the VIX is based upon implied volatility round the at-the-money (ATM) strike price while the SKEW considers implied volatility of out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes.   
>  
>SKEW values generally range from 100 to 150 where the higher the rating, the higher the perceived tail risk and chance of a black swan event. A SKEW rating of 100 means the perceived distribution of S&P 500 returns is normal and, therefore, the probability of an outlier return is small.

The number to ""beat"" or ""miss"" should be how much revenue you made this quarter and compare that to how much you made in that same quarter a year ago. You know... how much actual fucking money did you make.

These other tech companies are priced way higher than they were a year ago. IBM did not have the insane run-up as many of the tech companies pushing all time highs. There is no way those companies are worth their valuations, and this honestly proves it. Expect disappointing earnings all around for tech. The difference is IBM has a much lower price than it did when the recession started and some of these other companies are up over 30% from that point.

To me, very bearish news. No way these other tech companies can out-perform last year's earnings and yet their price suggests they'll way surpass them. If they only post about 60% EPS compared to last year like IBM did, expect large movements back down"
