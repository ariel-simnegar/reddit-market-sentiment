2020-06-11 08:11:32,BigNastyPie,-1,"Honestly this feels very bullish.

Every leg up so far has been met with “is this a bounce”, is this a “fake pump. “

Uncertainty is always dangerous, but with a pullback you removed the uncertainty because it happened.  We are what returning to the levels we experienced... last week. 

No way institutions can sell if they haven’t already, most people with stocks just had the greatest run up, no way they sell.

Best way to gauge call your parents, or ask at someone at work. Hey the markets are fucked eh? I doubt they respond with yup this is the top I’m all out.

Think of it this way before buying long term puts, if this does traceback down, we can’t pretend to ignore it, it will literally be a Great Depression. And in that case your money will do jack shit."

2020-06-11 06:54:53,pervsensei11,21,"Some personal thoughts regarding market movement, summarizing one of my old comment from a few days ago. 

The market is getting too good for its own good in the sense that if we rally too fast too soon it’s difficult to attract new longs above a certain value. But if it gaps down a little there will be more buyers that missed the rally wanting to get long at a lower price.

Liquidation breaks strengthen the market as it takes out the weak handed longs bringing in new buyers. Short covering rallies weakens the market as it takes out weak shorts and brings in new sellers.

Personally I don’t believe a circuit breaker day will come again unless there is a second wave. 

Jeromes meeting today shook a lot of people, mostly boomers who saw their portfolio recover in the recent rally and longs who jumped in at 290/300. These people were looking to lock in profits / stay on the sidelines until further uptrend is confirmed. 

My guess is we don’t drop below 3110. And this price target should attract new longs.

With rate cuts staying the same and the fed willing to do whatever it takes to keep the market stable, we should see new buyers and slowly keep going up unless we hear some significant bad news until Independence Day.

That being said I’m closing SPY longs IF we drop below 3110 tomorrow or if DXY drops below 95. 

I’m currently long VIX and SPY so I should be fine for the next two trading sessions. If you’re already locked into Longs with no hedge and very close expiry, I would continue to hold anything that is not already -80%. If your longs are far dated and -50%/60% at open tomorrow. I’d probably look to trim the position or close unless there is uptrend confirmation.

Good luck my brothers, the night is long and full of terrors. Hope you all live to see another day.

If not then I hope you learnt a lesson of never buying naked Longs without a hedge in a bubbled market."

2020-06-11 06:42:05,LMY723,15,"Don’t reply to this with political bullshit. I don’t care if you like guns or if you like Ellen. 

Trump is in the worst spot of his presidency, and the next month will likely be the most stressful part of his time in office. I outline some of the pressure he’s under below. 

1. Trump’s approval and disapproval ratings have hit their worst levels since pre-impeachment in November (impeachment only helped trumps approval numbers). From tweets he’s posted we know he tracks the approval ratings like a hawk. 

2. Trump resumes in person campaigning on June 19 for the first time since COVID began. There is nothing this man hates more than germs. Trump is going to be tired, stressed, and mentally exhausted from shaking hands and taking photos with people who he is concerned may have COVID. 

3. Ignoring Biden, many key senate republicans are up for re-election this fall. Last midterm was mainly Blue seats up for grabs, so it wasn’t as important for trump to campaign for the party to keep his republican constituents content. There is likely immense pressure for party republicans to consider distancing themselves ideologically from trump in order to win re-election this fall. The republicans up for re-election don’t want to sink with his ship if COVID spikes up again. Trump has had the main party’s support since mid 2017 and losing some of his more vocal allies has to hurt. 

4. He is about to start the next portion of his re-election campaign. I’ve read a few presidential biographies, and nearly all state that re-election is one of the most mentally exhausting times of the presidency. On top of this, he had to deal with impeachment this last winter, so it’s been nonstop for Trump. 

5. Laugh if you want, but Trump has only been golfing once since COVID happened. I imagine the bi-monthly golf trips he had before COVID were his exercise and mental escape. Losing that consistent destressor would be hard on someone Trump’s age. 

I don’t claim to know what will happen, but Trump is dealing with all his old tensions while having to juggle these new stress points. I personally believe the businessman in him wants to buy re-election so he will try more stimulus and pumping stock market as much as possible, but who knows. Shits gonna get wild."

If you didn’t buy puts before close yesterday then you’re too late. 

Because here’s what’s going to happen. The market is going to go down at open and for maybe a few hours after. And everyone is going to switch to puts thinking this is the next leg down and they will make tendies. So they’ll buy puts and feel good for a few hours. And when enough puts are sold and bought the market will skyrocket up.

Even after the recent pump and dump, it is still up about 25% up from it's pre-spike price. Small chance of it moving anywhere but down in the near future. The recent pump was pure fomo hype. What person would want to hold that dogshit if they think this is the bubble popping?

I know the price of puts will go up if it dumps overnight, but those $2 CHKp 7/17 look like a steal at $0.47. Have spy and mgm calls with 7/17 expiry that i want to hold thru July 4th. A put at opening could help these calls whether the drop.

Why is no one talking about this as a plan for call holders?? Is it that they can't because they are all in with no buying power left or that whatever calls they have expire 6/12 or 6/19?

If you are a permabull you are fucking retarded. Stonks don't go up every day, they just go up on average over time. 

If you are a permabear you are fucking retarded. Stonks go down sometimes but go up more often. 

What the fuck are you people doing. When you see shit is going down, sell your fucking calls, and buy puts, then sell them the next day. If it looks like it's going down more, buy more puts. 

After a few days of trending either up or down consecutively, shit will probably switch, so switch from calls to puts and puts to calls based on the trends. If you play it right you'll make money, then lose some as the trend shifts, switch up your shit, and make more money. 

Jesus fucking Christ people, like, are you kidding me? SPY 300 was an impossible meme not 2 weeks ago, and now that we hit 323 and are going down to 315 you act like it's the end of the world? No you fucks, this is called consolidation and it should be your best friend. 

The general uptrend will continue. Pick literally any stock or index and look at the 5 year chart. What do you see? Shit, it probably has gone up a fuckload. Stonks only go up over time, but they go down in between. 

As an options trader you are trading on VOLATILITY, any changes in stock prices, up or down, are good for you, but overall there will always be more up. 

Buy stocks for your long term portfolio during dips like this. Buy calls when these dips have gone on for a couple for days. Then buy puts when everything has gone up way too much too quickly. Rinse repeat. 

Jesus, you should make just as much money off stocks going down as you do on them going up."

He knew what was going to happen to the economy after an event like this so he threw everything and the kitchen sink at it (understandably). But now he's limited in what he can do, QE isn't as effective, and the market now knows there's no other perks coming other than a potential stimulus.  

But here's where he's a fucking genius. So you have these protests going on everywhere and they're going to be used as the excuse to why the market drops. He needed to increase the rates with the market at this level but didn't because he expects it to drop, and for the need for those low rates to still be there. If he knew another stimulus package was about to pass, he would have considered higher rates. It wont happen for a while, the country is opening up but will takes years to rebound, and they've destroyed the debt.  

Trump will get mad about the protests hurting the economy and demand stimulus only to get blueballed due to all the other spending. Then we hurt, bad."

Rode the six hundred Bulls.

Charge for the guns!"" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred Bulls.

""Forward, the Bulls!""
Was there an autist dismay’d?
Not tho’ the bull knew
J. Pow had blunder’d:
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred Bulls.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred Bulls.

Flash’d all their sabres bare,
Flash’d as they turn’d in air
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wonder’d:
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro’ the line they broke;
Cossack Bear and Russian Bear
Reel’d from the sabre-stroke
Shatter’d and sunder’d.
Then they rode back, but not
Not the six hundred Bulls.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
While Bull and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came thro’ the jaws of Death,
Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of them,
Left of six hundred Bulls.

When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder’d.
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred Bulls!"

2020-06-11 02:44:09,nautical_sausage,5,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sent a powerful message Wednesday that the central bank will keep pumping stimulus into the U.S. economy until its traumatized labor market has healed from the harm of the coronavirus pandemic.

“We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,” he told a video press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee held its policy benchmark near zero and almost all officials forecast keeping it there through 2022.

“We are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can for as long as it takes,” Powell said.


“The Fed is clearly very sensitive to the fact that the Great Depression was made worse by not taking action, and they don’t want to make that mistake again,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “The Fed, at least right now, wants everyone to believe that it will be easy for as far as the eye can see.”

U.S. stocks fluctuated and the dollar slumped as investors assessed the Fed’s views on the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to the lowest in a week, at 0.72%, as bond bulls were emboldened by the central bank’s signal that it would keep rates near zero and continue its bond buying.

The FOMC said it would increase its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities “at least at the current pace” to sustain smooth market functioning. A related statement from the New York Fed specified that the pace of the balance-sheet increase would be maintained at about $80 billion a month for purchases of Treasuries and about $40 billion for mortgage-backed securities.


“Acting on mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries underscores their belief that more support is needed,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton in Chicago. “The Fed does not see a victory in the employment bounce-back. The risk of deflation is still high and the economy needs more support to heal more fully.”

Asked about the risk of easy monetary policy stoking an asset bubble, Powell played it down by stressing the Fed was concentrating on restoring full employment and stable prices.

“We’re tightly focused on our real economy goals and we’re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at all,” he said.

On Hold

The Fed’s quarterly projections -- updated for the first time since December, after officials skipped their March release amid the burgeoning pandemic -- showed all policy makers expect the funds rate to remain near zero through the end of 2021. All but two officials saw rates staying there through 2022.

The economy faces “considerable risks” over the medium term, the Fed said in its statement, reiterating language from the last FOMC meeting in late April.

Officials forecast the U.S. unemployment rate would fall to 9.3% in the final three months of the year from 13.3% in May, according to median estimates, and to decline to 6.5% in 2021. U.S. GDP was projected to contract by 6.5% this year before rebounding 5% next year. Inflation was forecast to remain below the Fed’s 2% target through 2022.

May Job Surprise

The better-than-expected May payroll report could mark the low point for the labor market, Powell said, though the fact that it caught so many people by surprise “is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are.”

He also cautioned the labor market would take time to heal.

”My assumption is that there will be a significant chunk, well, well into the millions of people who don’t get to go back to their old jobs and there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time. It could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.”

Yield-Curve Control

Powell said the FOMC had received a briefing on yield-curve control -- a strategy to cap Treasury yields out to a specific maturity -- and told reporters that such discussions will continue at upcoming meetings. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect them to consider adopting the strategy later this year.

U.S. central bankers are waiting for more clarity about the shape of the recovery before rolling out a policy strategy that may involve explicit forms of forward guidance, Powell said.

“They are saying, ‘We are going to be easy for a long time. There is no rush here,’” and the projection to leave rates unchanged for the next 2.5 years is a “down payment” on more strategic forward guidance that the committee could roll out later this year, said Laura Rosner, senior partner at MacroPolicy Perspectives in New York.

Main Street

The central bank has unveiled nine emergency lending programs to keep credit flowing during the pandemic, though three are still to launch including a facility aimed at Main Street businesses.

On Monday it expanded this program to include smaller companies and said it would be open to eligible lenders “soon.” Powell repeated this outlook and also said the Fed was looking very strongly at how it could incorporate non-profit organizations in either the Main Street program or in a facility of its own.

What Bloomberg Economists Say
The Federal Reserve remained resolute in its dovish assessment of the medium-term economic outlook, estimating it would take nearly three years for the economy to return to pre-virus levels of activity, based on the median forecast.

Fiscal Aid

Fed officials have also made the case for more fiscal policy support in recent weeks, with Powell noting repeatedly that the central bank can only make loans it expects to get paid back, while grants backed by taxpayer money may be more appropriate in some cases during the pandemic.

Congress has already approved around $3 trillion in pandemic aid, including enhanced unemployment insurance benefits that are currently due to expire on July 31. Lawmakers have not yet reached any agreement on another round of stimulus as Democrats demand assistance for states whose budgets have been hit by declining revenue.

Powell, who last month laid out a powerful case for more fiscal spending, was more circumspect in his remarks on Wednesday. He said both the central bank and fiscal authorities may “need to do more” but he was careful to offer no prescriptions for Capitol Hill and said “that’s going to be their decision.”

See, I'm just like you in a way: I don't know what the fuck to do neither

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your meetings

‘Cause I don't really got shit else

I even got a shares account If I ever choose to reinvest

Sometimes I even short the market to see how much it bleeds

It's like adrenaline, the crash is such a sudden rush for me

See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it

Bears are jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7

Equities markets are going to flood the next few months because... where the fuck else are you going to put your money with interest rates at 0 and the USD losing value? We’re going to be having 10 straight Green Day’s and constant fomo again by next fucking week. Tomorrow is green. Friday is green. EOW next week is green. End of summer will be green. And don’t give me the “second wave” shit. Corona is here. It ain’t going anywhere. We aren’t locking down again. Forget it. It’s not right, but the stock market is going to be crazy inflated the next 2-3 years. The FED is pulling a New Orleans Saints salary cap and kicking the can down the road. Saying “we will deal with this shit another time”. And trump, his one fucking card he can play is market success. He will be pumping and he will be instructing the fed to utilize policies that will continue to pump. Not even talking about a calls and options standpoint... in the current climate, the only way you’re keeping up with inflation is through equities. I’m done with my rambling.

JPOW *really* went out of his way to avoid saying anything that would scare the markets. Loved how he totally dodged the question on market excess and bubble/volatility concerns 😆 

The reaction to the FED statements today suggests we’re in a balancing phase with the market still unsure how to respond. I guess some may have been hoping for further stimulus or a forecast for future rate cuts which could explain the EOD sell off, however it was likely also a combination of
short sellers taking advantage of the uncertainty. Luckily for you call holders, which I imagine is the majority of you, the big FED moves usually don’t happen until the next day after the market has had time to digest. We should have more clarity tomorrow.

From a technical standpoint, 3180 is important to recapture to trade back in previous bullish channel. Jobs reports at 8:30 tomorrow morning will also be a short-term factor although I doubt it’ll have a big impact."

Are they doomed to fall all the way back to pre-run up levels?  Highly doubtful.  Systemically nothing has changed.  Yes, it's possible some of the highly leveraged companies go bankrupt.

It's better to own stock or long dated calls right now.  If you're deep in weeklies and not prepared to lose it all, you should strongly consider cutting your losses and moving on.  I am deep in weeklies but I am also prepared to lose it all.  It's the risk I took and I accept it."

2. With the economy opening back up why would it take 2 years to get to pre corona levels? Other businesses will be able to fill in for the ones that went under post corona because there is still a lot of money out there, not really like the 2008 recession

It will likely go on until end of week - maybe early next week. The issue is that stocks that went up 20% in 2 days will go down 20% in 2 days.. but if the company is semi-solid, it will come back.. perhaps not tomorrow - but in a month? Probably. The issue is with short dated options... if you have a leap, a monthly.. or actually hold the equity, you ride it out.. if you believe in the company.

I'm not diminishing the pain of those who have lost thousands on options. it's painful.. but learn and adjust.

2020-06-10 23:38:22,,10,"we're not even down 0.9% and everyones screaming about second wave and another crash.

issa correction. Hertz went up 100% in a day, everything mooned over the last 2 weeks. 

market is gonna go down 2-3%. investment funds are gonna buy in when SPY hits 310-315, we'll go up for a bit.

the main things that will cause a sell-off across the market is mass-reporting of a second corona wave (re-locking down states and closing businesses), an insane amount of fresh unemployment figures and maybe some crazy things going on in china production wise (i.e companies not requesting supplies and factiories closing). 

the market has priced in not hitting the figures for this quarter however the current recovery is not like the great depression or the 2008 recovery since banks are still issuing loans and the governments are proactively helping companies meet their financial obligations, we can still expect a couple % of growth since companies will begin stimulating the economy at a rapid pace once employees get their paychecks and orders get filled.

im chatting shit i have no idea what's going to happen, puts or calls you're all gonna blow your accounts up and complain.

godspeed, pray for me and my yolo's."

Always take chips off the table after a big run, if your are gambler. Buy and holders had it easy for the past 10 years. Just buy an ETF and voila. Might not be so easy the next 10.

For these survivors, what signs will need to happen for them to jump in and invest as a bear? I don't mean to shift allocation into cash and gold; I mean actually being a bear.

Is the key the next earnings cycle? Is there some spike in COVID cases that will be a trigger? Maybe China needs to do something crazy? I'm legitimately curious what would trigger a bear to come out of hibernation now.

2020-06-10 23:12:33,Gear171,6,"All in WTRH. 

It's a food delivery service based in the South and South East USA.

DD: 
WTRH posted a nice Q1 earnings as a result of Covid.  General consensus before Bat-Aids was that they were a nice M&A target by Uber to improve their food delivery market share.  Then, Covid happened and they became quite profitable.

Uber desperately needs to acquire food delivery services to improve it's balance sheet with second wave of Covid now appearing inevitable.  It's the only way they can make and $$$ right now, and they need to bring in some tendies ASAP. Grubhub was in their cross-hairs, but after some anti-trust shenanigans, a European food delivery company just swooped in out of left field and scooped up GRUB out of nowhere.

Uber is now even more desperate to acquire market share in the food delivery space.  

WTRH is based in, according to the latest covid data, the new epicenter of Covid in the United States.  Food delivery will be a great business down there with all those inbred idiots who are too 'Merica to wear masks.

WTRH is looking like a mighty tasty M&A target for Uber or any other food delivery service looking to increase market share in the new epicenter of Covid.

TLDR:
WTRH caters to Rednecks who like food delivery and who are too stupid to wear masks and Uber is jonesing for more food delivery market share like a junkie with the shakes. Go all in and buy a Lambo with me.

All in WTRH 6/19 $3C

HTZ 6/19 $5P up 11%

Damn

Edit: More context. I sold Every position I had on Monday minus RDSA and RTX, for profit, (IVR,BUD,MFA calls) and then it kept going higher, so I bought more calls on IVR and MFA. Should of sold those positions at 11am when they hit the top, but I didn’t. Now I’m stuck holding them through this."

Then I realized that (obviously) I'm a pattern day trader now. So i have to wait 3 days to switch my account over the cash, which I should have done a long time ago.

2020-06-10 22:38:46,heartstesler,19,"Summary of Fed statement 

Economy may take very long time to recover and may not recover fully

The pandemic shock has severe impact on economic activity 

Over 22 M people unemployed and may not get back to work even after 3 years

May job number was a surprise but there was error of 4.9M people shown as employed but were unemployed so unemployment rate is 16.6% instead of 13.3%

The Unemployment will remain high for long time

Zero interest will remain for long long time as Fed is not even thinking about raising interest rate

Fed did not rule out negative interest rate this time

Lot of Uncertain about economic recovery 

Congress will continue to provide fiscal stimulus 

Fed will continue with easing monetary policy

Fed will continue to control the yield curve

Conclusion:

This is end of capitalism when both corporate America and  Americans depend on Fed and congress to continue to provide steroid dose of both monetary and fiscal stimulus to keep them alive forever

No need to do anything except trade options and listen to CNBC and watch future in night and market in day.


Market is totally disconnected with companies fundamental and their earning guidance, bond market, economy fundamental, dollar index, commodity prices, 

Continue to Keep investing in riskier assets!

Continue to enjoy the ride!"

2.	⁠Smart money will buy in, but it won’t be at ATHs

-High unemployment and poor GDP forecasts for this year but shouldn't be a surprise and actually better than some expected, rebound by next year so markets should go up due to markets being forward looking

So glad I sold this morning, I would have lost an additional 5k had I held through one more day. Right before market open I said, If Warren Buffet and Carl Icahn have the balls to realize a billion dollar loss, I sure as hell shouldn't sweat selling a speculative play at a loss to preserve capital. The only reason why diamond hands has worked for some of you is because we were in a mini bull market after unprecedented stimulus and the momentum of FOMO retail investors.

Plus insane 401k, every 2% you put in, matched 6% by the company up to 4/12%. That is insane. Free medical, hopefully option executions for my raises. So excited. Thank you covid for the bomb ass job. Sorry old team. They needed to hire people 2 months before lock down and never pulled the trigger. Their fault

Edit: I do owe like 80 grand in student loans still from biochem and can not outrun my interest at 22 an hour having them private.

NYSE Regulation reached its decision that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D after the Company’s disclosure on May 22, 2020 that it has commenced voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company appealed the determination in a timely manner and requested a hearing before the NYSE. At this time, the common stock of the Company will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE pending resolution of such appeal.

3. Unemployment a top concern, but improving at a ""record"" pace as seen in May, which should continue
4. ""We won't let small businesses fail""
5. White House commenting that unemployment has bottomed and therefore the economy has bottomed as well.
6. If you wear masks, you can stop the spread of Corona.

It's not quite as rosy as it was on March 30th as far as valuations, but the forward guidance is very favorable. I expect continued ripping in QQQ but also in value stocks moving forward.

The only sectors not to fuck with are hospitality and travel -- and even then, you should be investing in local travel plays, as people will shift from flying to driving their families to destinations closer to home."

If the financial crisis taught us that ""too big to fail"" means the government just steps in and saves that industry;

And we know that the largest companies only are getting larger gobbling up competitors etc,

Then we basically have an economy of ""too big to fails""

So whats the point in shorting etfs filled with too big to fail companies?

Do you think that one day the fed is just gonna say ""ok.. we're done. Lets all watch the economy burn to the ground as sectors fall like dominos""?

Seems like every country that can will just print currency, buy bad debt, and grow balance sheets that mean nothing🤷🏻‍♂️

But when I am right and make some jokes at others' expenses, people get *really* mad. Like, really mad. I've had multiple people send me hate PMs, try to doxx me, tag me for days straight to yell at me, etc etc. Like, jesus. It's not like I fucking know you. I'm not *actually* attacking you, personally.

I swear this sub didn't used to be this way. We used to laugh at retards, and the retards would laugh along. And, most importantly, all of us are the retards sometimes. But, now, good lord, people are so fucking defensive.

Is it the /r/all influx or something?
