Where did the cute girls go? You realize the bottom of your shoes are sticky from all the alcohol on the floor. There’s a guy nodding out in the corner saying “stonks only go up” over and over again. You realize last night you doubled down on calls after someone called you a pussy. You open up WSB and the first thing you see: “iMaGiNe BuYiNg CaLLs aT tHe ToP”"
