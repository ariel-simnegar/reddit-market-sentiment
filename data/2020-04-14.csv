So when the stock market has a blockbuster year - such as the nearly 30% rise in the S&P 500 benchmark index in 2019 - the payoff primarily goes to people who are already rich.

“For most Americans, a stock price increase is pretty immaterial to their well-being,” said Wolff, who published a paper about wealth inequality in the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2017."

2020-04-15 07:34:33,diicembr,4,"We're in a rebound pattern that appears to be losing momentum. Recovery plateau hit a 3 day recession APR 1,2,3. Since APR 3 we've been stepping up, 2 to 1, then 1 to 1, then 1 to 2, then a 1 up 1 down stall. 

It seems very reasonable to assume we'll either step up briefly and fail, stall, or fall one step and recover. It seems unlikely that any move will be permanent, not counting any artificial morning gaps up or down. Volume is still trending downward over all, even if more than yesterday. I'd put it in an acceptable margin of jitter to call it the same. Trumps pep rally today would make me lean towards the temporary rally if I had to put a bet on it. 

\*note, nothing I say is relevant to Tesla, who seem to be powered by a pilot who once made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. Only legit complete disconnect from reality I see in the market, but its funny as shit. Also means I probably missed something.

JC Penny, Bed Bath and Beyond

Short term Calls I like: 

United Health Care

Abbott 

I wouldn't hold any of these past a profitable daily shift, except maybe Abbott. You might think insurance companies are a no brainer, but billing has got to be nutty during all of this, and employers are laying people off. Most people layed off aren't going to pay cobra premiums over other necessities in my opinion. Abbott on the other hand, gets money direct from uncle sam."

They kept interest rates too low for too long, everytime there was massive downward pressure on the economy and markets, the fed would lower rates and print more money instead of letting things play out. It’s pretty obvious to see that if you keep on printing and you keep on discouraging saving cash with low interest rates, bubbles form extremely easily with everyone having excess cash to speculate, gamble, and be greedy. The thing is now the fed is trapped because if they go back to sensible monetary policy that organically allows an economy to go through recession to maintain price levels and a healthy functioning economy that actually increases in productivity rather than share value, all the major banks would default wiping away literally everyones life savings. Unless you have gold of course. Alan Greenspan will not be looked favorably by history."

2020-04-15 05:28:15,KimJongUnsTrousers,5,"Wayfair is one of the most interesting stocks. It's a shit company that was hurting pre-corona, laying off people left and right as sales slumped hard. It was down about 25% while the market hit ATH in February. Then, corona struck and it drilled all the way down to low 20s, down 80%. Now, it is 4X because apparently lots of people are buying stuff for home improvement during the lock-down and it is higher than where it was when SPY hit ATH 2/19. Nothin else has changed and they haven't rehired those laid off in Feb otherwise. Seems like the perfect candidate to short once we do have a return to normal timeline, just not looking to catch a reverse falling knife yet but this seems like one of the most obvious reversion to mean plays.

If you already know this shit then shut the fuck up and let the new people learn. 

Don’t ever open more than 2-3 positions. 

Don’t ever be afraid to take profit. Personally, at 200% I sell and don’t look back. 

Don’t ever ever ever buy an option, either call or put, that is further out than 4-7%. Even if it’s one option, it’s more likely to lock in tendies. If you can’t afford that find another ticker. 

And most importantly don’t ever ever ever spend more than 33% of your bank roll. Smart moves with 20-25% at a time will make you golden.

and millions have guns n ammo... when the MAGA die hards start to turn u will see what happens.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning very loudly."

After the 2008 crash Obama, Pelosi, Reid and McConnell wrote into the stimulus bills that the FED never ever ever ever again has to get congressional approval to give away bailouts to help businesses and the economy. 

So here we are. The fed Is now injecting 6 trillion dollars into big businesses and markets to stave off the second Great Depression. And since it doesn’t need congressional approval the fed will keep printing until JPOW cums himself to death. 

For now, most likely the next 2-4 weeks, the markets are riding high on 6 trillion and they will likely not go down. If they go down it will be in 5-8% drops with small recoveries in between. Is it possible a bottom drops? Sure. But JPOW will fight it tooth and nail. 

And the fed will keep printing. 

And if Donnie Pump gets re-elected the markets will sky rocket to literal retarded all time highs. 

This is the best DD you’ll ever read on here. 

So just enjoy the ride, try to make tendies, get laid, play video games and say fuck it.

Bonus Edit: stop playing SPY you autist retards. The literal moment I dropped my SPY calls and puts and started playing stock options I made more money than I’ve ever had in my life."

The downswing will be on news that’s perceived that we are doing it too early and/or without the proper measures in place - because there will be large outbreaks (there is a near 0% chance of this not happening) and any kind of real bounce back/V shaped recovery/“pent up demand” emotional bullshit that is holding up the market right now goes out the window (because the Fed money and a quick recovery is whats driving the current market). 

And the most recent model - a very, very realistic model shows us dealing with this virus in waves through much of 2021. And it’s not predicting mass deaths etc. it’s just predicting that we will need to use waves of looser and tighter social distancing (NOT necessarily a shutdown which they have shown is actually counterintuitive once you have measures in place to deal with the virus).

Edit: Banks, big money, smart money. They’ve all had epidemiologists on consulting retainer for a bit. They are not stupid and know what the consequences of just going balls out with no plan looks like and it sure as fuck ain’t V shaped.  Unlimited QE was enough when it was still thought possible we could get out shit together and under control and have a true recovery in a quarter or two."

More and more people getting greedy and stocks are moving exponentially, which does not make sense. I think there won't be any more short squeeze and there won't be such huge jump starting now. Only thang availble is QE from Mr Pow Jay. This QE injection is done in very linear fashion, just slowly increasing the uptrend support day by day.

Why would Goldman boost their rating now and not after earnings? Or after last earnings? I follow the company very closely. Their revenues will be the lowest in a year and they will probably have negative 500+ million dollar cash flow. 

The move is to buy puts that expire a week out and are $200-250 otm. Hold for a day after earnings and then sell. I’m telling you. Made 80K on the way up, sold at 900. The company is actually in worse position now than when it dropped last go around. Long term bullish but right now this is the short term play to make.

Theres been a big impact on the global economy, other nations wont be spending as much on American goods, tourism has already taken a big hit.

Devaluation of the US dollar, a 2T loan that will need to be paid back, USA still hasn't paid back it's debt from the last recession, looks like they'll be printing their way out of this one.

Approaching ATH, SPY300 and up in the current climate sounds highly unrealistic. Tesla looks like on big pump n dump and everybody is just shifting their money any place they can make a buck, if big tech takes a hit we will could possibly see a pivot.

Thinkorswim cash accounts (most cash accounts except fucking Robinhood) give you unlimited day trades until your buying power reaches 0. For example, if you perform a day trade and make $500 return in a account with $1,000. You can’t use the $500 to day trade until the next day. However, you can still use the other funds   ($1,000) in your account to day trade as much as possible. All the funds you make from day trade will have to be settled until next day to be reused again for day trading. You don’t have to worry about the 3 day trade limit or anything. 

Create a thinkorswim cash account. Margin must be disabled. Enable options. Speak with customer service to make sure you have cash account tier 2. 

If you still need help setting it up, just PM me or google around. 

It helps you with getting more day trades AND prevents you from over trading."

The only thing propelling this is optimism and perception with a healthy dose of Fed unlimited cash infusion, but there's real damage.

I did try and hold them. Market was rigged.

And I moved it to a short position very heavily. In fact, I took out a margin loan. WSB wanted me to get some margin. I said, ""I'll show you where they have some nice interest rates on margin."" I took out money—I sold at a loss like a bitch. But I couldn't get there. And the market was rigged. Then all of a sudden I see J Pow, he's now got the big phony QE and everything. He's totally changed the market.

I better use some DD just in case I start buying more puts. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start buying them. It's like a magnet. Just buy. I don't even wait. And when you're an autist, they let you buy it. You can buy anything. Grab 'em by the puts. You can buy anything."

2020-04-14 23:10:13,_elroy,6,"""Why are these reporters asking stupid questions"" you may be asking yourself.

Reporters play against the person they're interviewing. It's how the profession has always been done. The environment in which you interview someone totally contextualizes the response. That's why on 60 minutes, you have a nice, warm lit room, a 1 on 1 interview that is typically introspective and calm (usually). 

Here, in a press room, you want Trump to say what he really feels. If you've watched Trump these last 3 years, you know that Trump really starts laying in to what he REALLY thinks when he's hyped up, either with anger or excitement. 

This is why they ask seemingly stupid questions, because they're not eliciting a response to question, but putting trump in the headspace they want in hopes he speaks to what they wish to report about."

2020-04-14 22:56:54,el_semicolon,1,"Been cash gang for the past couple of months, but I’m pretty confident there will be a large politically-motivated drop in the next few days. SBA is running out of funds for loans and there’s no way we get a new bill passed quickly. The current market seems to be oblivious to negative news, but it isn’t immune to political uncertainty. 

SPY is a crapshoot because large-cap companies might weather this fine with all of the sweet bailout money, and the market is still ignoring the risk to consumer demand. COVID-19 still has a chance to do a lot of damage to small-caps imo. JPow buying fallen-angel junk bonds helps very few of them. Bearish short-term on Russell 2000

We’ll test 240, bulls will lose their minds and double down on calls. We’ll bounce, they’ll print. We’ll retest 220, bulls will lose their mind. Trump will likely be elected president again (because fuck mail in votes apparently) and then they’ll double down on calls. We’ll go sideways for a week or more. Bears will lose their mind, buying as many puts as they can. Most will be OTM and short expiry. They’ll lose it all. Bulls will buy OTM calls, and also lose it all. 

Then we’ll start moving down to our bottom over the course of 2-10 months, likely down to 140-180. Once we hit that, we’ll start the greatest bull run of all time, and trump will take all the credit whether he’s in office or not.

The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are providing this temporary relief to allow regulated institutions to extend financing to creditworthy households and businesses quickly in the wake of the national emergency declared in connection with COVID-19.

The agencies are deferring certain appraisals and evaluations for up to 120 days after closing of residential or commercial real estate loan transactions. Transactions involving acquisition, development, and construction of real estate are excluded from this interim rule. These temporary provisions will expire on December 31, 2020, unless extended by the federal banking agencies."

Our economy is beyond fucked but I don't know when or if it will be reflected in stock prices. What growth are investors expecting from tech companies during a global recession? Maybe the clue lies in how I am about to put my 401k back into the S&P, because there's nothing else to put it into anymore.

>The brand had previously announced a pause in its global ship operations from March 14 - May 14, 2020, effectively cancelling all voyages scheduled to operate during that timeframe. The decision is a proactive response to the unpredictable circumstances evolving from the global response to the COVID-19 situation.

This is the dumbest fucking market. Are we literally just printing money, devaluing our currency in order to artificially prop up the stonk market to give the appearance that everything is okay? How about that money actually go into the economy to help actual people or fuck, even companies.

I'm down $25k on my 4/17s. You win JPow. I can't wait until we go into a fullblown civil war with millions dead sending the stonk market to all time highs."

To come on here and seeing people toss lots of money into YOLO Puts makes me laugh my ass off. We will probably see some volatility in the markets, but the idea that Puts are the play anytime in the next few months just isn't based in reality.
