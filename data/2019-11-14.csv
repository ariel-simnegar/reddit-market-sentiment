Cracking Open the Great Lobster Arbitrage Trade
U.S. lobster exports to China are among the trade flows that have been hammered by the trade war that escalated in mid-2018. But American lobsters are apparently crawling up to Canada instead, and then making their way east.

By Nathaniel Taplin

Lobster exports to China are among the trade flows that have been hammered by the trade war that escalated in mid-2018. U.S. lobster sales to the Middle Kingdom, running at nearly $90 million in the first half of 2018, plummeted to just $19 million a year later, after China imposed a 25% tariff on America exports of the shellfish delicacy. China turned to Canadian crustaceans instead.

However, things aren‚Äôt quite as they seem. American lobsters are apparently crawling up to Canada instead, and then making their way east. U.S. lobster exports to Canada were up 120% in the first quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, and nearly 220% in the second quarter, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, in a recent report, also notes that U.S. lobsters are apparently showing up in China, often labeled as Canadian lobster, shipped through Vietnam.

The Sino-U.S. trade war has reshaped global trade flows: Chinese-origin goods flow through Southeast Asia to avoid U.S. tariffs, while U.S. crustaceans may be clawing their way back into China through a similar route, camouflaged as their more northerly cousins. Where there is demand, supply finds a way."

Also, the holidays are well known as the time voters discuss and start making up their minds before election season, which will be in full swing come the new year. Phase 2 and possibly 3 will keep the market hopeful into November 2020.

As for what to trade: energy. Phase 1 will be almost solely agriculture deals. Farmers have machines and supplies waiting, but will need fuel. More shipments, fuel. Cold winter, fuel.

Then there's Aramco IPO and OPEC cuts in December. And possibly a middle east skirmish or two to deflect attention from impeachment hearings.

You may not get the same level of adrenaline, but it's close enough. I been swing trading 200shares of CRWD, and that shit has been giving me the same level of thrill that options has.

Our current situation bears a striking resemblance to the price action from the end of April.

Special note to the price action from the bottom then, to now, inside the double boxes.  Also similar in the RSI break of resistance, and hold.

The outer blue we can see a price break and basically hold of the 20ma, which is where we are now currently.

So watch the 20ma to press to the 50 and fucking blow out ( ie, retarded bulls get fucked.)

2019-11-14 21:18:17,UsuallylurknotToday,2,"PSA: You're holding too long. I used to think there was such a thing as theta gang. There is not. 

&#x200B;

The real puppet master 3D gang is: Hot Potato Gang. 

&#x200B;

Most options expire worthless (like 90-98%). The trick is to take profits when you see them and not be the last guy holding the bag when the bell rings. There was so much swinging in today's market (mainly referring to SPY) if you lost a lot or didn't make money youre a greedy fool. I lost a bit due to poor positioning and running out of day trades, but I was able to recover on other positions for the most part. 

&#x200B;

\*Retarded secondary PSA but it's worked for me: 

&#x200B;

If you cannot day trade-

&#x200B;

Stagger your positions. Think tomorrow is a down day? Take a near the money put exp tomorrow. Then take two out of the money calls expiring on Monday. Assuming it rockets up, your puts are already worth less than before, but not by as much as an OTM put since they were near the money when you bought them, sell at a loss and manage the profits on the calls for monday. If SPY rockets down, you make some money closing the puts and your hedge across the weekend doesnt take as bad of a decline since there's still time to expire and you can sell those at a negligible loss as well."
