I sold 14000 stocks of AMD, and waiting lower price to buy back.

Instead of waiting for lower price (let's say my plan is to buy back at 35$) can I sell $35 140 puts contracts expiring this week? If it drops below and I get assigned, I get shares that i wanted anyway, and if not, i keep the premium. Did i get this correct?

i believed in the long run Disney+ will win out and if you factored in the bundle price (hulu + ESPN+) its much better deal than Netflix standard plan while the cost is the same.

let me repeat once again, like I did yesterday

If you were stupid enough to buy index puts, especially fds, sell them if they're green
you are fighting against the rest of the world that wants markets to go up

I mean maybe you get lucky holding overnight and indexes go red tomorrow, but you're also
fighting against theta, gamma, and the long term expectation that indexes only go up
