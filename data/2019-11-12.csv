I sold 14000 stocks of AMD, and waiting lower price to buy back.

Instead of waiting for lower price (let's say my plan is to buy back at 35$) can I sell $35 140 puts contracts expiring this week? If it drops below and I get assigned, I get shares that i wanted anyway, and if not, i keep the premium. Did i get this correct?
