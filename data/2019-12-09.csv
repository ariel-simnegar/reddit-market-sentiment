2019-12-09 23:56:08,knotswag,28,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Not much to update. We're trading a touch below Friday's range, which is not anything alarming. Most indicators are sitting at neutral, but given the potential volatility this week, I expect we'll break one way or the other by EOW. 

I don't expect much to happen until we get those catalysts. Watching NQ, we headed down to a support level at 8339.5 but have since started to rally back up, though I will note sell volume has been pretty large in relation to what we've seen for a while. Even if we keep heading up, without news, I'm inclined to think theta gang will rule the day and we trade pretty flat tomorrow, so within 315.3 and 313.9. 

The bearish case tomorrow is we could head further down to fill our gap up on Friday, with support at approximately 312.4, but I don't see us breaking that without Mango intervention. So if you're playing puts and want to lock profits, a few cents above that range might be a good sell zone. 

See you all tomorrow and be careful with your tendies this week as we wait for Gyna deal to destroy half of the sub."

u/J_Powell_Ate_My_Ass, u/iliveforedm, u/CrohnsandCannabis, u/Ryhearst

You?

Itinerary:

**Day 0**, Wednesday - sleep well tonight. Pack if you haven't already.

**Day 1**, Thursday - day of flight to Vegas: forget about market for the day and wake up in the late morning or early afternoon. Make sure to take a dump to get it out of the way. Get ready for evening flight, get to airport early and arrive in late evening, Uber or rental car to check-in to our rooms, then meetup at Pho Kim Long to eat some 24/7 pho. For some reason, the waitress recognizes u/iliveforedm

**Day 2**, Friday - finish eating pho around midnight or 1am, then we can bitch about premarket if applicable. Then we go to a 24 hour Starbucks to ensure an all nighter through market hours. After market close we eat somewhere. Either the buffet or a breakfast place. Or if someone made some tendies, we'll go somewhere fancier. After buffet we'll be very tired due to all nighter and the serotonin from eating foods. We sleep for like 12-14 hours and wake up Saturday morning.

**Day 3**, Saturday - we are well rested and wake up in the morning. Everyone takes their dumps and gets ready. We eat somewhere, then walk around strip/casinos during the day. Evening we go to Fremont St and walk around some more. u/CrohnsandCannabis gets hustled by the street performers and gets guilt tripped into donating. After that we go to a casino and pool our funds to spin a high limit slot machine. Maybe each put in $500 and do a machine that is $100 a spin. If we get wiped out, we go to the tables for more fun. Then we go to a ""gentlemen's club."" u/J_Powell_Ate_My_Ass has to go to the room for creaming his pants. It is almost bedtime since we woke up early, so we go eat somewhere if hungry, then go to bed. Before bed, take a nice long bath.

**Day 4**, Sunday. We have Monday checkout so that we don't have to worry about rushing out on Sunday. We wake up, do our thing, then we meet up at a sportsbook or something to wait for premarket to open. We bitch about futures being red or green, then u/Ryhearst talks shit about how futures don't matter. We eat, maybe make some sports bets, then check out of rooms and take our evening flights when it's time to go, then maybe some of us will do another all nighter through Monday open."

2019-12-09 21:17:37,Korean_Govt,-2,"I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there

I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind

I'll put TNT in your behind. I said

One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor

A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got

'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock

I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike

What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop

The hippie to the hippie

The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it

To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie

To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

A skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo

And guess what, America, we love you

'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul

You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old

I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast

But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast

Rock it up, Baby Bubba!

Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie

To the beat, beat, it's unique

Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat

And the food just ain't no good?

I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed

And the chicken tastes like wood

So you try to play it off like you think you can

By saying that you're full

And then your friend says, ""mama, he's just being polite

He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!"""

No signs of excess like an excercise bike company being valued at $16k per bike they‚Äôve sold. 

No signs of excess like a rental company signing long term leases and and renting the same space out for less on a short term basis being valued at almost $100B

No signs of excess like a fake taxi company that loses money on every ride being valued at billions. 

No signs of excess like a dog food company that sells dog food at a loss being a hyped up IPO

No, nothing to see here. But the dips goddamnit because soon enough daddy powell will be buying up etfs to keep this shit heap propped up. Bull gang for lyfe"
