I have been here ""since the beginning"" (in WSB speak, right before the crash). The crash was epic and many of us made money on the way way down. Many of us made money on the way up.

The reason we hit the March lows was because the entire system froze and the Fed had not acted yet. There was a ton of uncertainty. There is much more certainty now. Liquidity is not an issue. The coronavirus is more understood. The economy is re-opening. A vaccine is coming (at some point). These things are as close to certain as possible.

Eventually, the US economy and society will crash and burn like the Roman Empire. However, it will not be because of coronavirus. It will be because of the zombie apocalypse or some other exogenous event (like the sun expanding in several billion years and consuming the earth).

For now, my old man advice (I am 39), is to ride the waves. Hold more equity than options. Be kind to each other.

xoxo

*What does this mean?*  This gives rise to the omnipresent collective that us temporary or flash bulls and bears have unknowingly created.

KANG GANG

A stupid number of new Robinhood small traders have entered the market recently and I know many of them are reading this right now.  How does a function f(t) look after adding to it a high amplitude sinusoidal input?  Well, it would look as if a kangaroo was bouncing along f(t).

We have completely destroyed fundamentals *in the short term.*  Playing options that expire within a few months has gone from gambling to degenerate gambling.  

This was a V shaped recovery soon to be a W shaped recovery soon to be just a literal zig zag.  This will be the death of theta gang once and for all.

you're not alone. huge drops are ALWAYS followed by HUGE green dildos or a looong green period.

Following 2/24 the market crashed another 10% lower before a 4-day bounce.  If same pattern held up this time that would put the downside target around 275 in SPY.

Not saying history will repeat but just pointing out what could happen and use caution on buying the dip if SPY price is still over 290."

2020-06-15 07:29:40,Omega_scriptura,-9,"Bears appear to be slightly overconfident - it is unlikely the market goes down very far beyond SPY 280 while news of the Oxford/AZN vaccine is expected soon but has not yet been revealed (and no, this is not ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù). It is therefore doubtful this is the ‚Äúnext leg down‚Äù. 

Most likely we now bounce between 280 and 300 until that vaccine news breaks with variations as there are minor peaks of new infections etc Oxford has previously said they expect to have initial indications on efficacy anytime from now; AZN second quarter earnings (and therefore outlook/update) are on 30 July. I would expect something in the next month if the news is positive. Negative news even if just a ‚Äúno result yet‚Äù on or around those AZN earnings. 

Do not underestimate how quickly Oxford will work to publish good results - the first working vaccine that gets out the door means a lifetime of research grants for the scientists who worked on it, an almost certain Nobel prize and your name in every history book for the next fifty years. Incentives are, as ever, the key to understanding much of human behaviour. 

Positions: depends on your outlook on the vaccine. Far OTM Calls with expiry in late August/September look better to me the redder that futures get. As does buying and holding an ETF tracking a broad index although that‚Äôs not nearly as fun. 

Tl;dr: Market kangaroo until vaccine news. Vaccine works = moon. Vaccine fails = Big Red."

I bought puts too late. We‚Äôd already hit the bottom. Every circuit breaker day I thought it couldn‚Äôt keep plunging, but it did. Finally got in and the recovery took off immediately and didn‚Äôt stop. But that didn‚Äôt hurt much because of the thing I did right - bought the fuckin dip. Watched my poots go to zero and didn‚Äôt give a single fuck because that rally was face ripping. 

SHOP shares doubled in 3 weeks. Shares, not calls. Lots of shit like that. Anyway, you can be wrong in one direction here and be fine. But what you can‚Äôt do is be late to be a bear and then late to be a bull. Don‚Äôt chase. Buying puts tomorrow is a sucker bet. IV and theta will eat your ass.

2020-06-15 04:59:03,bobstaman,2,"Come around the campfire you guys. Let me tell you about a story.  
  
  
Back in the day.. there was this baseball player. He played through school and did ok and got into a university that was a pretty decent. The school was good, the team was good, the girls were hot.  
Now this guy wasn't that good of a baseball player but he wasn't that well known but very well liked by his teammates. So his mates came up with a plan to play up their friend and tell everyone he was really good. They tell all the players on that team, the coaches, heck...even the girls knew. So he comes to the school to tryout, does surprisingly well and gets on the team.  
  
They have a great season and they're in contention for the playoffs. He's been doing well, not great, but not bad. The team is in the home stretch, 3 games left to decide if they make it to the playoffs. They're stoked, they're pumped... but an old friend tells him on Facebook that he's coming to the game. He wants to be there, he's pumped too!  

They need to win 1 game of these 3. They've beaten these teams before so they have their confidence. The friend shows up a little early, comes around during warmup, the player that's been hyped up misses a few grounders and eh no big deal. Comes back to the dugout and the friend comes over and goes down history lane a little bit. ""Hey man.. remember back in high school and you made like 5 errors that one game? haha... It's all good man, get after it.""  

  
That's all it took. That little bit of doubt to seep back into that player's head was all he needed to be reminded that he... isn't the guy everyone thinks he is. He's not that good of a player, he's just gotten lucky. He's just had the diced rolled in his favor every single time since his mates hyped him up.. but now he realizes.  
  
  
He did the worst he's ever done. Worse than high school. They lost the three games, didn't make it to the playoffs, and he didn't make it on the team the next year. It can be going as well as ever can be but if the reality is that you haven't done what's necessary to get into that position, it can catch up on you. If you can't field a ground ball and throw it for an out.. you shouldn't be in the playoffs.  
  
And if you're going to fake your economy and act like everything is fine and dandy with an exuberant amount of debt.. eventually.. if you can't get your actual economy booming to a point where it all makes sense... you're not going to make it to the playoffs. Go Kang Gang."

The 3 biggest drops in March for SPY were 3/9, 3/12 and 3/16. Here is what happened on each of the following days.

* March 9th - prior close was 297.46, March 9th closed at , closed at 274.23 on the 9th for a total loss of 7.6%. The following day, the market bounced back on March 10th and closed at 288.42, gaining back 14 points. More importantly, the day following the bounce up was a drop of another 14 points to 274.
* March 12th, the prior day closed at 274.36 and on the 12th we had the second biggest drop ever of 9.51% down to 248.11. Again, what follow the next day was a bounce up to 269.32. However, again the following day after this bounce, the market dropped from 269.32 all the way down to 239.85.

Even if you look at the big drop on March 2nd, we went from 309.09 down to 300.24. The following day bounced up to 312 which was followed by another drop to 301.

I bought calls at the end of the day yesterday (Thursday) expecting a bounce on Friday but I went with puts at the end of the day today (Friday). The volume spike was the largest we've had on SPY since March and what followed a rebound bounce after a big drop historically has been another leg down. Monday feels like it's going deeply red but weekend news will help dictate that direction."

You made the plan for a reason and it can be very costly abandoning that plan thinking you'll catch the falling knife.

2020-06-15 04:26:45,Matt_Hunter_Hall,3," 

I'm about to check out all of the open interest on major options expiring this Friday.

Quad witching was a let down because the MMs pinned the market to not have to pay out as much on the options they sold.

I'm wondering if the move last week was based on the record amount of OI in OTM call options expiring 6/12 & 6/19 - and all the news about RH, 2nd wave, FOMC guidance was just a narrative to explain things but not causative reasons in and of themselves. MMs sparked a dump last week to not have to pay out on the huge call imbalance.

This week option OI is again at record highs but there are a lot more puts and straddles. I could see this ending up pretty flat end of week even if we have some deccent volatility between now and friday.

Remember, the media narrative can turn on a dime and in one day things go hyper bullish again."

Early fears that critical care physicians had about becoming infected with the coronavirus have eased significantly. Cassiere, who said he was terrified at the beginning of bringing the virus home to his family, has tested negative for antibodies. He credits appropriate use of personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves and gowns.

""All my protection I've had has helped. I'm confident that I'm not bringing it home. I'm confident that if I'm protected, I'm not going to get infected,"" Cassiere said. ""And now, I'm armed with the knowledge and different approaches I have for battling COVID-19.""

Experience matters. ""Being a good critical care doctor is a lot of experience,"" Rice added. ""Now we've seen this, and we've done this, and it will result in us providing even better care for our patients.""

""We know we don't know everything about it, but we know the spectrum of disease and what it does to the body,"" Cassiere said. ""I didn't know that back in March. I have all that knowledge behind me. I'm a COVID-19 warrior now. We're totally prepared for it.""

I'm a bear man, ladies and gentlemen. I have numerous concerns spread across this state. I have many liquidations flowing at many thousand barrels per days. I like to think of myself as a bear man. And as a bear man I hope that you'll forgive just good old-fashioned plain speaking. Now this work that we do is very much a family enterprise. I -- I work side by side with my wonderful son H.W. I think one or two of you might have met him already. I encourage my men to bring their families as well. Of course it makes for an ever so much more rewarding life for them. Family means children; children means education. So wherever we set up camp, education is a necessity, and we're just so happy to take care of that. So let's build a wonderful school in Little Boston. These children are the future that we strive for and so they should have the very best of things.

Now something else, and please don't be insulted if I speak about this: puts. Let's talk about puts. Now to my mind, it's an abomination to consider that any man, woman, or child in this magnificent country of ours should have to look upon a put as a luxury. We're going to dig spy drills here. Spy drills means irrigation; irrigation means cultivation. We're going to raise crops here where before it just simply was impossible. You're going to have more gains than you know what to do with. Blood will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am.

President of France Emmanuel Macron (pictured) said Europe needs to be less dependent on other countries, mainly the United States and China in terms of trade.

The nation has joined forces with Germany aiming to come up with an ""investment plan"" for jump-starting the continental economy, Macron revealed. He promised to begin working on the issue at the upcoming European Council, underscoring the only way for the French economy to be rebuilt is by working with other nations across the continent. ""This marks a new chapter in European history,"" he said, adding Europe will come out of this ""stronger, more united and more sovereign.""

The president explained the decision comes amid ""disorder"" visible in other countries that haven't handled the coronavirus outbreak as well as France, which has highlighted the dependency European countries have on supply chains with other nations.

I signed up for Robinhood during the autism storms back in February and lost money(Not enough to say any big amount but I am but a poor man) on AMD calls, 60c 3/20 and everything started going to hell... But since then I've watched and watched and everythings only gone up. I even decided I wouldn't do calls and I just invested in a few companies and tried to spread it around some, still not really any substantial amount but I've been enjoying watching things and wanted to see what I could do. Those stocks went up. Stonks only go up... Then I decided Monday I'd place a call again, checking it out, reading WSB and thinking about how Vegas just opened up and MGM was opening a new casino and hotel- They can't go down, there's no way. So I bought an MGM call, 26 by 6/19 thinking there's no way it can't hit that... Then everything started dropping. And because I have autism and am incapable of being intelligent, I doubled down on Wednesday and bought a 23 by 6/19 thinking if it doesn't hit 26 it'll at least hit that.   


I am by no means king of the autists, nor any retarded royalty... but my timing remains impeccable. I should walk away, or just develop a portfolio... but I'm probably gonna watch everything and then buy Spy puts here in about a month thinking that's the secret. So buy Spy calls now for 2 months from now and they'll print"

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a cautionary message about the U.S. economy and Covid-19 when he appears twice this week on Capitol Hill.

His remarks to lawmakers are widely expected to echo the mostly downbeat assessment he gave June 10 after policy makers held interest rates near zero at a two-day meeting and signaled they‚Äôd probably stay there through 2022. His performance, which highlighted the hardships faced by millions of Americans who‚Äôve lost work, drew criticism from a White House official for being overly negative."

Actually read this article and look at what‚Äôs happened with spy since it‚Äôs publish date. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-cure-risks-being-worse-110052807.html ‚ÄúThe Fed will finance a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for each acronym to conduct these operations. The Treasury, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, will make an equity investment in each SPV and be in a ‚Äúfirst loss‚Äù position. What does this mean? In essence, the Treasury, not the Fed, is buying all these securities and backstopping of loans; the Fed is acting as banker and providing financing. The Fed hired BlackRock Inc. to purchase these securities and handle the administration of the SPVs on behalf of the owner, the Treasury.

In other words, the federal government is nationalizing large swaths of the financial markets. The Fed is providing the money to do it. BlackRock will be doing the trades.

This scheme essentially merges the Fed and Treasury into one organization. So, meet your new Fed chairman, Donald J. Trump.‚Äù"

Tech I totally get, some bounce back from travel, events and brick and mortar retail I also get.  But In your heart of hearts, should SPY be where is is? With companies trading at 30-35 times valuations?

Like by all means, play the run up.  I made a yacht full of money on HTZ calls when I saw the quality of investors going in. But are any of you honestly surprised in your heart of hearts that we‚Äôre being corrected?  Especially after last week, which looked exactly like the beginning of the crash in early March?

2020-06-15 01:25:59,18845683,5,"Figured I'd post this here:

The shutdown in Beijing is not unique and is something that's happened a number of times in other Chinese cities since March. E.g., [1](https://news.yahoo.com/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-another-152245854.html), [2](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/beijing-city-shuts-down-gyms-again-fears-of-second-coronavirus-wave.html), [3](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/china-seals-off-cities-near-north-korea-as-new-clusters-grow)

The latest outbreak in Beijing:

> 11 residential compounds and several schools near the market have been closed. Movement restrictions were also brought back across the capital, sports events were suspended, tourism from other parts of the country barred and plans to reopen primary schools put on hold.

This is all over **42** positive cases (allegedly).

However, because China is so heavily urbanized, public transport focused, and with poor public hygiene standards (i.e. washing hands etc), they are uniquely poorly suited for CV19 outbreaks, because of the importance of the **dose** you may receive under such circumstances. (Dose being important to how severe the disease may progress in otherwise younger healthy people.) Imagine a country of NYCs, basically.

Plus, schoolchildren aren't vectors for Covid:

>[Children are unlikely to be the main drivers of the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic ‚Äì a systematic review](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gnk6i3/children_are_unlikely_to_be_the_main_drivers_of/)

>[No evidence of secondary transmission of COVID-19 from children attending school in Ireland, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gx4sld/no_evidence_of_secondary_transmission_of_covid19/)

Masks help. We don't even need to lock down again, just stop seeding corona patients in nursing homes, protect the vulnerable, and encourage mask wearing. 

[Officials studying how a salon with two CV19+ hairstylists transmitted it to zero of their 140 patrons](https://nypost.com/2020/06/11/no-new-coronavirus-cases-for-patrons-served-by-infected-hairstylists/). One thing they did was wear masks.


Three studies that came out last week on masks:

  ""There is a realm of existence so far beyond your own, you cannot even imagine it. I'm beyond your comprehension. I'm a gambler. Rudimentary creature of blood and flesh, you touch my mind fumbling in ignorance. Incapable of understanding. Degenerate? a label created by the masses to give voice to their ignorance. In the end what they chose to call us is irrelevant. We simply are.   Social life is nothing but a waste of time, a weakness. Your lives are measured in selfies and approvals. You wither and die. We are eternal, the pinnacle of evolution and existence. To us, you are nothing. Your extinction is inevitable. My kind transcends your very understanding. We are each a nation - independent, free of all weakness. You cannot even grasp the nature of our existence.  Your words are as empty as your future. This exchange is over.. """

my ""feel the market"" senses tell me that there will be a selloff if we don't get any good news. we are still too close to green on the year, with all the negative headline momentum there will inevitably be some de-risking in equity portfolios. however i still think this market has insane support at 2800-2850, if 2930 doesn't hold this week that's what next week's downside target should be."

Coronavirus cases spiking at an alarming rate.

JPow already said millions of jobs aren't coming back. 

McKinsey predicts this is a catalyst for 800K+ jobs going away due to automation.

Stimulus and printer go brrrrr can't beat there being no demand currently. It's not a supply issue. 

None of the furloughed people who will get laid off when PPP ends are currently e being classified as unemployed. The # in two months time will be staggering.

This is essentially a capital bubble akin to the housing bubble in 08'

This market reacted properly in March and then went full retard due to Bull gang.

There might a few dead cat bounces but its a raging mechanical bull market... the correction is coming. Just buy the dip. This market is 100% legal gambling at this point short term. Long term stonks still only go up. However June-August won't be pretty IMHO."

It's illegal to buy it without money you don't have, but that doesn't really matter 'cause, get a load of this, all right; if you get stopped by Robinhood after you get margin called, they can't just take the money from you if you have it in another account.*
