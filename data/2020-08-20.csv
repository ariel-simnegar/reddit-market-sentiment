* Lawyers who understand finance are rarely unemployed
* Engineers are rarely unemployed
* When things work out, make sure you understand why it works out. Nobody wants to analyze the golden goose until things go south.
* If you want to make big money, you do it by execution. 100,000 people have a hairbrained idea; 10 people try to do something with it; 0-1 succeed. Alternatively latch on to a meme CEO who has the ""success vibe"" and get yourself some stock options
* At the end of the day we're all gonna die. What do you want to accomplish in life? More importantly: what is the road not taken that you will regret in 20 years? Going on a date with a girl of your dreams may be something millions of people do every day but it is a big step for *you.* Do something that's high-risk and high-reward (high-risk without a significant chance of loss of livelihood, that is)"

MOSCOW, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The Moscow Exchange will launch trading of the 19 most liquid shares from the U.S. S&P 500 index on Aug. 24, the bourse said on Monday.

The exchange had earlier planned to offer trading in U.S. blue chips from Aug. 17, in a breakthrough for a long-awaited project which was slowed by Western sanctions.

The exchange will offer shares in Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, NVIDIA Corp, McDonald's Corp , Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc , Exxon Mobil Corp, Boeing Co, Intel Corp, AT&T Inc, Pfizer Inc, Visa Inc , Netflix Inc, Micron Technology Inc, Activision Blizzard Inc, Walt Disney Co, Advance Micro Devices Inc and Mastercard Inc.

The Moscow Exchange will also start trading Apple Inc shares on Sept. 7.

Russia's largest bourse has said it will add more names from the S&P 500 later this year, planning to trade the stocks in Russian roubles. (Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh and Elena Fabrichnaya; Editing by Mark Potter) Get ready for the putin pumps to combo with our trump pumps. That man knows money is power and has a ton of money so why not buy power via the stock market. Im ok with them buying at this price. Currently buying the ones I think are easily said in Russian.

Second, they are also more likely to live in urban areas, which, as we have seen, also contribute to higher crime rates.

But the onions started rotting, so he shipped all the onions outside Chicago to be cleaned and shipped back while simultaneously buying puts on onion futures. Other futures traders got reports of all the onions going in and out of Chicago and thought there was a glut of onions and started buying up as many puts as they could too and that motherfucker got rich as fuck. Eventually onion prices crashed and there was an onion shortage.

They never needed a car but now outside the city they of course want a techy Tesla.

If it's a five for one split like Tesla:

You'll have 5x the shares at 1/5 the current price. The shiny new shares combined will be worth the same as they were before the split.

No, you don't get 5x the money. Think about it for a second, don't go full retard.

Yes, fractional shares also split. See above for all the complex maths.

Yes! In fact your options also split. The market doesn't just completely fuck you over (unless you bought puts on Tesla). Again, see maths above if confused.
