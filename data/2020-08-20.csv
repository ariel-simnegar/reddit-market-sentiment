It is 60.3 reported vs 55.3 expected.

That is fucking weird. As a context the last time UK PMI hit 60.1 was back in 2014. (from 2014 to 2019 was on a downhill from 60 to 50)"

I am not betting against Elon yet, but Tesla will get rekt as the front runner of this market whenever the market reconnects with real value creation. 

Retail dominates the current market where there is relatively low institutional volume, wsb as a whole is probably the biggest trader in this market, it’s a crazy time we live in."

2020-08-21 09:16:56,Beyond_Duality,9,"Musk tweeted that TSLA stock was too high? He tweeted that on May first. 5/1
5 for 1 split. That tweet was his way of telling us he was going to split the stock. He tweeted it at 8:11am on 5/1. Split was announced* 5:1 on 8/11. 

Elon this week tweets 🐍 🎷 and “snake jazz or Polynesian elevator“
