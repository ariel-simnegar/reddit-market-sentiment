Just as baffling is the exponential growth of stock values over the 1920s, a 5x increase between December 1920 and September 1929, with the most dramatic upswing in 1929.

By June 1932, the value of the market had fallen below its December 1920 level."

2020-08-06 05:00:06,strawberry-jam-boy,12,"To my night crew:

Gold and the bond market in sync, driving upwards. Which makes sense because one of the driving factors behind gold price is opportunity cost of holding similar instruments (other assets). So if bond yields are going lower, there‚Äôs less of an opportunity cost to hold gold. And if bond yields are perceived to be lower for a long time, then gold can go even higher, as it has. And so gold can move in tandem with bonds, suggesting not the inflationary outcome we‚Äôve been hearing since mid March, but rather the deflationary prospects that have been actively traded in the market place going back to 2018. The longer the time interest rates are low, and the lower they are, the higher gold goes. Hence, low rates and gold rising are deflationary.

Any chance he gets to make me look bad, he takes it. Any chance he gets to crack a joke at my expense, he takes it. I'm grateful to have had a father who was able to always provide for me, but sometimes I can't help but feel I'd be a lot better off in my life if I actually had a dad who encouraged me and supported me in life. My dad killed my confidence in myself, even tho I knew I shouldn't have given him that power. It just always bugged me how a dad could put his only kid down continuously. I'm slowly starting to become confident because life has given me no choice, but my dad putting me down fersure had a major negative impact on my psyche."

No, we need to make real fucking money. How do we do that? We follow J Powmoneybags. No, we don't ride the fed, or just ""buy stonks cuz brrrr"" like cavemen fuckin morons. We become king retards -- we could run the fed by appointing someone who posts green like twice. 

All we gotta do is invest a whole bunch of money in a completely fraudulent, commoner-talking/viral video fodder cocksucker who just wants to make **us** fucking money. We see the blueprint: win presidency, can't get charged, everyone gets rich. It's right there. It happened; we can do it, too. WSB 2024"

Greetings, I hope you are having a great afternoon.

I send you this message to encourage you to release more positive news about the purchase of Tiktok, or even the Pentagons' defense contract. Over the years I have been a loyal purchaser of call options, sometimes even going as far to ""Yolo"". As a loyal investor, and share holder, I expect you to fulfill your duty to our fellow shareholders to pump this bitch. I have calls valued in the tens of hundreds of dollars, an extreme sum of capital when discussing the target audience of your new found acquisition in Tiktok. Mr. Tim Apple is always in the news bumping fists with the young, progressive, self-victimizing dick choppers. It is now your time to make yourself relevant to the younger generation by facilitating Tiktokthots. Do what is right. Do what is profitable. Release the story.

Yours truly,
All share and call option holders."

[this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18524231/7497431) stack overflow post explains the FIFO and pro-rata algorithms for continuous trading well enough. Unfortunately I can't post comments due to insufficient reputation, therefore I'm asking here:

Given a situation where there is e.g. one sell-order at 100, and one at 101, and I submit a buy order for two stocks @ 101, I will get one stock for 100 and one for 101 according to the example (both in FIFO and pro-rata).

So I get a potentially better price than what I offer, whereas the orders that are already in the book get exactly what they ask for.

Another possibility would be to have me pay 101 each time and give one of the sellers 101 instead of the 100 he asks for.

Is the general strategy here that the later order gets the more advantageous price? And once you're on the book you can't get a better deal than what you offer?

Why?

Does anybody have a pointer to where this is discussed?

Related question: are incoming orders always processed sequentially, or is there parallel matching at big exchanges?"
