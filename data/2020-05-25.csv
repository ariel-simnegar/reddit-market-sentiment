So on the one hand I lost my 200+% gains of BABA calls for May 29, 6/12 and 6/19 for 200-215 calls, but doubled down, switch some 6/19 from 210 to 215, and got 7/17 220s Friday near close. 

My plan was deposit another 3k into my account and put it all on more BABA calls further out but between 205-230c for Oct-Jan as it continued to drop Tuesday. 

However BABA is super fucking up, nothing like before but still gigantic gap up, so my entry point is no longer as cheap and accessible as I wanted, but now my doubled down calls will print and maybe get back to where I was when I was up 200+% on half as many calls. 

Do you think it is still worth it at open with the newly increased prices to still get those Oct-Jan calls but maybe instead of 205-230 maybe 210 or 215-250?"

this market makes complete sense to me. In order to understand why we are gonna break 300 SPY soon, you need to keep in mind 3 things:

1. The Feb-March sell-off was not just Covid. It was a liquidity crisis. And it was the impending sense that the 9 year bull run had to come to an end. The Fed, with JPOW's big printer dick, solved the liquidity crisis by their emergency measures. The low of March 16th was the result of a genuine fear that we might enter into a recession. But jpow did an excellent job of providing liquidity to the markets.
2. Bernie Sanders dropped out. Which means, almost to a guarantee, that Trump is going to win. 4 more years of the orange man means 4 more years of ridiculously good market conditions. Don't know if you remember when Bernie was surging before Super Tuesday and Biden looked all but defeated, but after Biden's limp dick got that viagra shot he needed on Super Tuesday, the markets rallied hard, reaching 312, the highest level since the major drop in mid-Feb.
3. This weekend, with the videos of party-goers, and casino attendees, lines out the back, confirmed and calmed the most serious concern about the post-Covid economy--consumer demand. Supply shortages can be fixed, but if you have problems with consumer demand, that is really really bad and hard to fix. What this weekend proved was that the American consumer is just as willing and able, to spend money, buy shit, etc, as before Covid-19, if not even more.

So putting all the pieces together--the Fed's cut to interest rates, emergency bond purchases, loans to business, solved the liquidity problem that pre-existed Covid and was the biggest hurdle to the continuation of the bull run. Four more years of a Trump presidency is all but confirmed now that Sander is out, which means buying stocks now will be cheap in comparison to in a year. And most importantly, consumer demand remains intact and vigorous, despite the 2 month shutdown.

We got a fake recession that forced the Fed to provide unprecedented levels of support and liquidity which will fuel another bull run as Trump is the likely winner in another election. consumer demand appears to not have been dramatically effected by the coronavirus and the shutdown, which means low interest rates, stimulus money, and a phased return to normalcy, will result in ATH's and a rapid recovery. We got a huge bailout for a virus that is not that deadly and that has not deflated  levels of consumer demand in America (I am only talking about now and into the summer months, not April or March which obviously had a dramatic effect on consumer demand).

Bonus:  43% of coronavirus deaths in the US were old people in senior homes. I am sorry if anyone has lost someone to the virus, I lost an uncle. But he was already sick, and though he was taken too soon, he was on his way out, as I imagine many of the senior home deaths were. I have to imagine that in a sick and twisted way, this is good for the economy, but don't quote me because I am not sure of the levels of consumer spending for that demographic

The only remaining problem to a bull thesis for a V shaped recovery is solvency issues, which may become a huge issue if business cannot reopen to full capacity and the government and the Fed start to restrict and pullback their assistances too early."

1. Gambling in the market will lose money over the long term. Just like slot machines, etc.
2. Shorting is one of the hardest things to get right. The best investors with the largest returns are not those who short, even in stagnant markets like Japan.
3. The best way to make money is to invest in solid companies over the long term.

This is boomer esque, but at the very least don't short. Wait for opportunities to go long"

Better to miss a profit from a leg down than watching money burn holding PUTs

Trump Bucks are mostly already spent, and the unemployment relief from the CARES act expires in about 2 months. The bill to extend this relief is tied up in senate, with a number of major obstacles to overcome.

Although The Fed's recent actions will likely result in inflation eventually, right now the economy is most facing deflationary pressures. We recently saw the worst GDP numbers on record, and the lowest production numbers in history across multiple sectors.

Meanwhile, the spectre of a second wave lurks in the wings.

Trump Bucks are mostly already spent, and the unemployment relief from the CARES act expires in about 2 months. The bill to extend this relief is tied up in senate, with a number of major obstacles to overcome. 

Although The Fed's recent actions will likely result in inflation eventually, right now the economy is most facing **deflationary** pressures. We recently saw the worst GDP numbers on record, and the lowest production numbers in hisotry across multiple sectors. 

Meanwhile, the spectre of a second wave lurks in the wings.

You are probably wondering why stocks are going up when the world economy is fucked (yes it is but I still have calls on spy and qqq). It is because the rest of the world is even more fucked. Japan is in its 4th lost decade. China was heading to recession before this from the largest credit build up in world history. Euro zone is on the verge of fracturing with a banking system that makes us during 2008 seem sane. Emerging markets is completely and utterly fucked for the next 10 years due to capital outflows and the inability to engage in stimulus without making their currency go to zero, global trade shrinking before covid and many countries such as Mexico and Brazil were already in recession.

Basically the world is going to burn for the next 10 years and the us is the safest place to put your money. If you are going to short, you should short like London commerical RE or HK developers, or Brazilian retailers, not cash rich us large corporate or tech companies. There is $300 trillion in global wealth, 220 of which is outside of the us, just a sliver of that moving to us assets will lead to appreciations you cannot even comprehend right now.

Add to that the benefits of zero interest rates and unlimited liquidity in the debt markets (thanks Fed).

Add to that strong progress on the health front, with progress on vaccines, and decreasing deaths, hospitalizations, etc.

If the economy begins to bounce back in Q4 2020 - Q1 2021, then the S&P 500 is right where it should be.

Not sure how everyone in here trades/on what their strategy is, but i know a lot of people think 1% gain is wack. It's not. If you can manage to scalp 1% a day for an entire year, you'll return 1100% year end.

To put that into perspective, if you start with a little 5k account, you'll end the year with 60k.

55k profit (thats basically salary)

I know 99% of you take positions that are, for the most part, in profit at some point but refuse to take the profit home because (it can go up some more) Take the damn profit home.

If you have a stop loss at .25% and only win half your trades at 1% gain, you'll return 550% year end.

Also, Q2 numbers are going to be disgusting, and the the market's euphoric dream will eventually have to come to terms with the economic reality.

As such, I'm eyeing **$75k worth of June 18, 2021 SPY $270p's**. This should let me have enough time to benefit from the significant downturn that I expect we're going to see. I'll also be able to sell calendar spreads against it, and I can switch to diagonal spreads if we ever go ITM. 

The ask on Friday for the 6/18 2021 was $22.88. The ask for the 6/19 $270p was $2.36. All else being equal, if I sell the premium 13 times, I should be able to recoup my principal even if the position doesn't get ITM.

$DOCU - stayed relatively flat on Friday but has two catalysts upcoming with a shareholder meeting on Friday and earnings next week. Between these two events, the expected move is between 8-12% combined. I got some OTM FDs for July, but I am expecting a solid increase in IV and share price within the next 5 days before earnings.

$PSTG - earnings are on Wednesday and ever since they failed to bust below $15.50, I started loading up. To my surprise ARK Investing has also bought significant amounts of $PSTG up to $16.00 recently. This is one of their top 20 holdings now, I think I might follow smart money and hold through earnings on this one.

$BOX - another earner on Wednesday, bought before Friday and so I am up a good bit, but I think the hype on this will be real tomorrow and Wednesday. Not sure if I want to hold this one but if they do have great earnings, there really isn't much stopping this until $24-$25 resistance level from pre-COVID.

Following a few days of down service and several exchanges with your team I have been informed that my subscription to ''the recession'' has been cancelled.

I am very confused by the situation. Your support team ran a technical analysis and ensured me my  recession was still active and the difficulties I experienced were within limits and should be solved soon. This is not what happened.

Since my subscription was cancelled I would like to check with you that my 10-year payment plan in form of lost revenue and new taxes will be promptly voided.

As a commercial gesture I would also wish to get a discount on your new ''massive stagflation'' subscription (the 30-year plan).

I'm here in Central California and it is spreading and the fear mongering by the media has made it to where the economy can't function. People need to man the fuck up and get back to work. 1 of our employees got tested positive for CV and everyone wouldn't come to work until we got everyone tested. One of the cashiers a 22 year old healthy woman was shaking uncontrollably when she found out and left. We are now closed because the fear is so great.

I think once we hit it we either bulldoze through to \~302 and then sell off, or go flat at 300. Either way, I'll start to buy 295p around then. If I miss a little bit I'll double down, pretty confident it will swing back at 300. This week starts green and we see selling starting Thursday-Friday. The rocket launch is a huge thing I don't see a lot of people here talking about. If it goes wrong the market shits the bed, if it goes right there's only a little upside. I saw one of these Tesla rockets go off before live, and shit is insane. The boosters land on their ass next to eachother. I have 99% confidence the launch will go as planned and cap off a victory lap memorial day weekend for Trump and America. That 1% chance it blows up is scary enough that I'm going to limit my risk and hide in some safe tech for Wednesday into Thursday. I'll prob by a couple shares of google or something and see a few dollars of gains. I'm heading down to the launch site with a couple tabs and some beers to enjoy the fireworks either way.  


Zoom puts make a lot of sense to me, and I'm afraid to miss it. PTON puts make sense too, with summer coming up. Going out this weekend showed me first-hand evidence a lot of these covid related stocks are going to finish up. I'm going to sell off most of my MARK, get rid of my SRNE lottery tickets, and try to avoid meme tickers.
