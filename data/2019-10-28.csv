2019-10-29 06:04:44,Fan_Boyy,-8,The new watchmen series is proof yet again that women can’t lead. Crappy fight scenes. The bad guys are Republicans Lmao. Their guns suck. Their cars suck. No hot chicks. Flashbacks every 5 seconds to spice things up in an attempt to make up for the dry storyline. D-grade acting. Crap music except the song the rorshock dude was listening to before he shot that dude who wanted to inspect his lettuce. There’s sooo much bs that has nothing to do with the story. Like let me spend 10 minutes tucking you into bed after you passed out at my husbands funeral and the only line of substance is “you get those fuckers that killed my husband” like lmao that’s implied bitch you don’t need to have a tuck you into bed scene for that one line.  Why the fuck were the news reporters wearing bug wings when they could’ve just sent in a DJI phantom drone. Those bug wings were cheesy as all hell. The fight scene between the chick and the kkk dude in his trailer after they shot the cows was weak af. Once again women can’t lead and she’s proving it by sucking at fighting. Like if you follow a klansman into his trailer after he tried to shoot you then you’d better know how to fight like a ninja not just tackle each other into mirrors and glass tables and shit you fuck. Then there’s the cops shitty little plane that blowtorches the Cessna out of the sky. Like what’s the point of that damn thing? It can lock into targets like it’s a fighter jet but it could barely keep up with a rusted out pos plane? Oh and then there’s wannabe Morgan freeman in his wheelchair just taking his sweet time to be as cryptic as possible just giving her clues like this is a damn hardy boys novel. Like who the Fuck casted this thing? Did they just go to a nursing home to find this disinteresting old fart? Oh and let’s spend 5 minutes showing the lead girl helping him into her car after she finds out she’s his daughter because yeah we really need to capture that moment in slow motion! And mother of god lets end episode 2 with some beastie boys yeah!!! Cuz that music doesn’t blow balls or anything Lol I may as well listen to Jurassic 5. Fucking trash. You know what it makes sense though since this is what I imagine antifa listening to as they fight the good fight against the republican kkk members who are trying to milk them of their liberal tears. Yeah they would listen to some dumb shit like that fist pumping the air like the Gwen stefani Fucks they are. 🗑 🗑 🗑 short hbo
