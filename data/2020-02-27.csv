please dont be triggered by how ignorant I am about finance, I beg you :)

I sold $30,000 in VFIAX two days ago because I think the stock market will go down due to the coronovirus and the suspension/breakdown of the supply chain, plus the potential for additonal quarantines and general human panic. My husband is very very upset with me....""you cant time the market"" etc.

I view it like this: I haven't ""lost"" money; I invested about 20k and over the years, now have 30k, so yay! If it was 33k a few days ago, who cares? It's not like I lost that money except on paper. And if I 100% buy back in a month, or two, or three, or whenever this is over, wont I have spared myself some losses???

I am sick of being called a retard if I ask these questions, so please dont share your opinion if that is your communication style. But I would appreciate any kind -hearted person who could explain to me if/how I am understanding things incorrectly, because I hate being at odds with my husband and yet I cant understand his POV, even if it seems obvious to everyone else.

2020-02-28 06:19:16,freehouse_throwaway,10,"Here's another factor to consider as Pence is now leading the effort on coronavirus response from the US government.

It's pretty clear what this admin has in terms of priority (aka what POTUS wants) and Pence adding Kudlow to the coronavirus task force reaffirms that (dudes been going on TV saying we got this contained). For those following thru trade war cycle, you'll fondly remember the dude as POTUS's number one pumper.

Admin/POTUS, seems to care more about how the virus will affect the market (aka, a ""grade"" on the economy to him) vs any actual outbreak containment and warding community spread.

Reports are out already that communication will now have to go thru Pence, so there's a high likelihood that really bad news won't get reveal in a timely matter if it may have negative market/political inclination.

The problem with that though is that the news will eventually get out given how things simple always leak in this admin. So the affect will come out w a lot worse and set in further panic.

Imo, trade with information from career health officials or state officials. Whatever come out of the White House should be verified. I still think risk in the US is relatively low compare to other brewing hot beds like Korea and Japan, but it really is only a matter of time given how interconnected we are these days and how fast this virus is spreading. 

At the end of the day, it's not the mortality rate that's the issue. It's the disruption to the global economy, the fear that slows the daily grind, and the natural tendencies for human to not deal well with the unknowns."

The rumors are that the central banks are meeting with FED over the coordinated move this weekend to calm the markets. This is the info that I have seen from at least three non-correlated sources on twitter and coming from HF managers/ veterans of trading. 

&#x200B;

Another PM ex-citadel also called that tomorrow might be the bottom. 

&#x200B;

Just the amount of veteran PMs from BBs, WS and HF coupled with quant risk managers saying that 290-295 should be the bottom before we see a relief. 

These speculations alone make me do a bunch o fyolo trades on the upside. If I lose I lose a bunch of thousands and learn not to believe twitter but these guys advises made me money and all of them called the top at 340 and turned bearish.

2020-02-28 03:52:18,kohcacola,9,"Maybe this can help you make some money...

So, this week was my “trade of the year.” Started buying puts from 1/24 till today. (See link) Lost some premium in the middle, but held firm to my thesis. Got rid of most of my puts today, but still holding 70 2/28 SPY 303s puts for tomorrow (avg. price $1.67 per when SPY hit 308.5 today) plus a bunch of VXX Calls. In any case, most of you guys are thinking of buying puts over the weekend. Fear will be high tomorrow and no one wants to hold over the weekend. Very logical, but likely wrong (again). We are due for a rebound if for nothing more than a technical bounce, so I will close all bearish positions by noon tomorrow and buy 3/4 calls around close (I’ll be selling these by 3/3). 

My underlying bearish thesis still stands. Actual additional cases in the USA will drop the indices like a rock. However, short term, I think this is priced in. Long term, not so much. I’ll be shorting any vicious spike up (potentially at a better price than sub 300). Any relief rally inspired by rate cuts, helicopter money, potential vaccines or even confirmed vaccines is a gift for those who want to short. We have started to panic, but it could and will be much worse. Why am I confident? Because I actually understand virology, unlike some of the one trick perma bulls here. Good luck to all, regardless.

Even less if you sell the puts near bottom of the first dip, sell the calls on the bounce or pump that will most likely happen just like today, and then rebuy strangle at peak and repeat. The reason why you wanna rebuy a strangle is because sometime market makers will try to pump the market just before close to wipe out high volume puts right before close.

2020-02-28 02:05:33,CitrusGator,11,"People need to realize it’s about maximizing your profit while also fulfilling the goal of securing gains. This seems like basic knowledge, but today’s volatility will punish those who are greedy. Set a % gain goal for your positions and sell when you get there, unless you’re fine losing everything. Leverage with volatility this high can be painful either way. It’s much better to make money and regret missing out on more, than wait on 200-300% gains, only to watch the options go to $0. Some people should go for the 1,000% gains, but only if you fully acknowledge that volatility may fuck you. Set a goal and if you hit, make a new plan. It also allows you to trade both ways"

Dollar probably won’t lose value directly.  The US dollar is a safe haven for those outside the US, so they convert their currency into dollars, driving up to demand for dollars, raising the value of the dollar.

It is likely, however, that the Fed will reduce US interest rates to stimulate the economy, in order to offset the economic slowdown. Lower interest rates mean that businesses can borrow money more easily and continue to operate or expand their business. But lower interest rates also means lower demand for the dollar; those holding dollars will earn less interest in their bank accounts, so that means lower foreign demand for dollars.  So lower interest rates will lower demand for the dollar and drive the price downward somewhat.
TLDR
I don’t think that the interest rate reduction will be sufficient to fully offset the increase value of the dollar as a safe haven."

They are made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none, but they are manufactured, tremendous — if you are into this — tremendous fumes and gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right spewing, whether it is China or Germany, is going into the air. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off, that is true. By the way, they make you turn it off. And yet, if you killed one, they put you in jail. That is OK.

Reasons of the top of head:

Who the hell wants to own an airline stock going into the weekend?

NYC news developing. 

News with regards to domestic virus has been worsening/accelerating every day. 

No business is going to start insisting on business travel if the employees are concerned. I think it’s reached that point. 

Likelihood for Bad news far outweighs good at this point and especially domestically. 

Fares will have to drop for non-business travel. 

So far only negative news (non speculative) has been with regards to international routes. Only a matter of time before domestics start to suffer. 

Have heard from business travelers today and yesterday that on flights they take weekly, there is 25-50% less passengers. 

Spring break coming up. 

Trump keeps saying stupid shit and put “smoking doesn’t kill” pence in charge. 

And no idea if Delta still is less susceptible to oil, but they aren’t gonna let the price of oil stay this low (the only tailwind currently). Production will be cut. 

Would love to hear counter arguments."

Welcome back to another edition of MAGICAL LINE TA brought to you by our sponsors: COVID-2019, Trump, and notQE.

I have moved my anchor down to the morning low of 3006, which is my new anchor because of the bounce after that tried to and failed to make a new high. The first extension down is at \~2933 which we already tested and bounced from slightly around 6pm EST. The second extension down is at \~2888 which is another -3% from our close today at 4pm. The 3rd extension which is also the 50% extension level is \~2885.

As for support levels, I can't really find one on the larger time frames other than 2930-2940 level which was the top from september 2018 and april 2019. I would think that we'll test this level tomorrow (maybe even over night) and then see a drop through. There is however resistance on the VIX around \~41ish so that will act as a mini buffer for the markets. If VIX breaks above this level into the mid to high 40's, I could see us tanking all the way to \~2816 which is around 282 on SPY.

An upward catalyst was introduced today with rumors that Fed may give us 1, 2, or even 3 rate cuts (wild right) by the end of the year. We won't know for sure until a Fed member comes out and outright expresses support of this but be careful of intraday bounces. 

Just my personal opinion, but this is going to get worse before it gets better. How much worse? I'm not sure. I don't think we're going to see many more days like this but I do believe we will be in a downward channel at least until human trials start on the vaccines. Trade safely my friends.

PS. I'm too lazy to make an imgur account to post up pics of my charts, sorry to whoever asked before."

&#x200B;

Statistically 12% wipe off in 5 days happened 9 times in the stock mkt history. 7 of this times the stock rallied 4-9% on the next day and 2 times was down 5-7%.

&#x200B;

DD: dont try to catch a falling knife, if you have positions just ride it out. Wait till Monday on the mkt direction cuz if during the weekend CBs would come up with massive liquidity injections, puuts would be fukked. 

&#x200B;

And going for calls into the weekend is pretty bad now cuz most of coronavirus news are coming after the weekends. (mostly negative)

1) Gold isn't going up. Why? Because people want to have cash on hand to throw it back into the market. 

2) If Gold is not spiking it means people do not think the market is fundamentally fucked. So most likely it means when we rebound we will rebound HARD. 

3) We need good news otherwise this will continue. And there is literally nothing that tells me good news is on the horizon.

B. Buy 2-6months out! FD’s will stress you out more than you deserve. I know it’s tempting when you don’t have a lot of money to buy short strikes, but you’ll lose until your account is zero.
C. Don’t get greedy! Especially if you have FD’s, exit early if you’re up. Hoping for 200% while you’re at 50% will leave you with 0%.
D. Volatility is going to be nuts for at least a couple months. This will shake out paper hands and break FD holders.

Lowes just announced 1.7 billion in investments towards their supply chain.

Take a look at their 5 year chart and you'll see, like many other meme stocks, its growing consistently.

If you analyze peaks (you can go look at this yourself im not going to draw it out for you) you'll notice that Lowe's has a trend. At the beginning of their dip the clock starts ticking for roughly 6 months of downtime before MASSIVE peaks.

The housing market is likely on the up. Interest rates are lower than they've been on mortgages and more people are being drawn to buy. More houses = more supply chain = more $ for retards making calls 6 months out on a projected growth.

we never broke past the 50% retracement from the overnight highs to the morning low at 3006. we were also in a rising wedge pattern with volume decreasing throughout the day. it tested the 50% retracement for a good part of the day before volume picked back up to drop us back down to our 200DMA which was 3048. After that, it traded at support around 3022 before dropping down and TANKING to the 23.8% extension target at ~2970

Sorry to anyone who reads my MAGICAL LINE TA posts, I shouldve posted around mid day about all these indicators because it was the perfect chance to get puts but I was swamped at work. Looking forward to working with you all in these crazy times."

Holy shit. 

As some have noted, we've not seen a drop like this in any recent corrections. None of my crayons projected a drop this quickly. My updated ending price target is 295.5 for the conclusion of the correction by adjusting for the initial gap down we had on the 24th, but like most, I thought we'd have some sort of kick-back rally before we hit current levels. I'm very concerned about market health in general because ISM of numerous countries are being released on Monday. If news is bad, especially for US, it could mean some more bad times ahead-- and that's before we even get bad earnings. This would be a rapid shift to bear market before economic indicators confirm, and that means things can turn really messy for the market. While many of us are expecting it, I don't think most of us are expecting it to occur this quickly.

The support we blew past was 299, so tomorrow I'm looking for something between 295.5 and 299. That drop at the end was seriously bearish. Looking at /NQ futures, we're coming up on the [""fair value"" support.](https://imgur.com/z8Z9V5V) Considering we blew past the one for SPY at 309.5, we should watch to see how futures reacts. 

Be really careful with your tendies. It's getting spooky out there."
