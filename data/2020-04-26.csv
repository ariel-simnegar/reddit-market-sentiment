Ik it's an opinion piece, but feels reassuring at least as I've been sperging so hard about inevitable deflation for the past week. Almost feels like being a conspiracy theorist despite not even being an uncommon macroeconomic theory.

I get the sense rich people are afraid that consumers are going to start hoarding cash or something, but that's why inflation should largely occur bottom-up rather than top-down... yet the stimulus bill was blundered on many levels. It's a bit shameful how poorly covered this issue is, considering it's unlikely to be solved until people are aware that it's a problem and demand change."

2020-04-27 07:04:18,CEII13,28,"CNN BREAKING NEWS: Bulls R Fuk

By Wolf Blitzer, posted 2:58am ET

In a shocking turn of events, Dow Jones futures were green to start the night and are now just kind of green.

S&P 500 futures were also pretty green, but now they're half as green.

And the Nasdaq was up, like, almost a full percent. And now it's not.

""Bulls r fuk,"" one WSB Analyst told our correspondent.

The bulls could not be reached for comment as they were already fast asleep, but did provide this statement in a press release:

**Premarket doesn't matter until 8am bruh. Shut the fuck up and go to bed already.**"

No, its not going to go flat like NFLX whose revenue source is plebs paying $11/month (or whatever the fuk it is) for movie streaming. Also NFLX went down because they expect fewer customers in the future, but with new cloud customers ur getting way more than $11/month ESPECIALLY as companies scale their cloud usage. You can’t scale profits on customer’s netflix usage, that only adds to netflix’s expenses.

MSFT’s Cloud Azure product is rapidly gaining market share and a month ago their devops team literally put out a piece saying they had to limit the # of new Azure customers because of all the demand around the world (and the increase in Teams users). Cloud is insanely profitable and its what makes up for 70% of AMZN’s profits. Since Azure is 2nd behind AWS theyre gonna see way more growth.

Theyre also getting way more customers who never would have signed up for cloud to begin with. I work in IT and theres a lot of orgs who store their data in physical data centers. With the shift due to covid-19, you’re gonna store that data in the cloud for a myriad of reasons. = more customers.

Why?

1.) Nikkei Futures price broke their post-crash ATH today after JP Central bank boosts aid. SP500 Futures followed closely (up 1% at JP market close).

2.) Similarly I think The Fed & JPow still have at least one ace up their sleeve. Although Donnie Pump/Mnuchin kind of hinted in their presser last week that this phase (""phase 4"") would be the last round of stimulus (but they would consider more stimulus).

TL;DR - stonk go up tmrw probably. stonk get tired soon. money printer low on ink.

Think about that but for malls, stores, longer waits for restaurants with half capacity, etc.

Sure grocery stores have people sanitizing carts but inside the few stores you can enter it’s mostly a joke, with maybe 1 in 5 people wearing a mask. 

Obviously from a fiscal standpoint hemorrhaging money and having the Fed prop up the market screams imminent collapse, but if the average Joe don’t understand that, they still takes this as a joke, so they’re still going to buy up stock and double down on their 401k right now because “stonks are on sale”.

2020-04-27 02:30:18,BlueKnightJoe,10,"Reasons bulls give for why this rally will continue:

1. Virus is overhyped and everything will open soon

2. Market is looking forward to next month/quarter/year and already priced in the worst of the pandemic recession

3. MMs/Fed is corrupt and will keep printing so you might as well ride the wave

I disagree on all counts. Virus is going to kill more people and in a shorter time frame than expected. Market is delusionally optimistic about the 2nd half of this year. And the Fed can only print money but not jobs or oil.

I know it sounds ridiculous but I just can't think of any other company that executes as well as them. As an ex-CTO and developer I have used hundreds of AWS's features over the last several years and they continue to release new products within AWS that are ahead of the competition and further increase AWS's value as a whole (there is a huge network effect within AWS). On the retail side, Prime continues to grow like crazy and their margins increase as they create more of their own brands. There are very few products that it makes sense to NOT buy online at Amazon.

Anyways, even despite the recent stock growth if I had to pick only one stock to hold for the next 5 years it would probably be Amazon because they consistently show how well they can execute."

Robin hood definitely introduced a blind population to stocks, and if shit goes south, not only retirement is going away, but also people that literally put their savings and their mama and dada money into the market. 
I hope these kids understand what unmaintainable growth is and who will eat it when suddenly the whales that bought amazon at 200 decide that thatMs the end of the road for now. AAPL over 220 is insane. The markets are literally now to make short term gains, and people think this is the 2000 or 2009 where you buy and hold.

- People panic, lock down starts again

1. the death of amazon student prime will be felt in this quarter, students dipping/canceling given the student acc was auto rolled over to the yearly acc aka lower subscriptions 
2. bezos is logistics king but the supply chain is fucked, good number of nonessential stuff has quite a long wait time for delivery, which was the whole pro of using amazon rn (# of people switching over to ups or fed ex through direct shipping / purchasing of some goods) 
   1. leads to warehouses seeing shortages on some stuff and not on others, not exactly a huge focus on retail stuff
   2. may have an increase in X stuff selling (ie food and electronics) but Y stuff may be down by a big bit (other trash, summer / spring related out door shit) 
   3. business consumers may be down (office stuff is rip) 
3. stock shart relatively unsupported esp given literally every other company (even those not directly affected by covid/even those benefiting from covid have seen some slow in their growth or fall ie netflix) 
4. walkout strike for friday didnt really happen, possibly just diverted and if strikers have a brain in their union it'd prob happen closer to earnings (aka this week)
5. idk about aws: record low number of data sci job recruiting may be an indicator of less use of intensive programming on their systems, likewise relative number of data use per business prob down given some arent really even operating rn, aws is like free money for em and a big cover for operating costs sooooo i think operating costs may be up a bit this Q

2020-04-27 00:34:59,DonniePumper,7,"Here’s a big DD nugget for you guys....

US Congress comes back in session on May 5th, and at that time they’re going to begin negotiating another stimulus bill, this one being the largest in terms of money, likely in the $3-4T range. It will include money for cities & states, and Dems are trying to get it to bail out deeply indebted cities and state governments such as Chicago, Illinois, New York, Detroit, etc(which Republicans have little interest in doing). Trump is really pushing hard for this to include a significant Infrastructure component of $2T which seems to have bipartisan support on everything but the cost.

Anyways, I doubt they put $2T toward infrastructure, but even a smaller number is going to make depressed Infrastructure stocks skyrocket. Even if they don’t reach a deal, these stocks are going to rise on the possibility of a deal. 

I bought 1000 1/15 LEAPs in each X and CX, which are super cheap. Will likely add more LEAPs in the coming week or two when I sell my NAT Tanker Calls."

I think we stay in the wedge for cash open, and there will be a fair amount of chop as traders jockey for positions on ER. Soon, though, we're going to break out and follow the arc to start testing lows. In the near term, I'm looking to pick up some 5/8 295c, and maybe 5/15 300c (risky). Cash gang is not a bad place to be right now. If you've got 5/15 puts, I'd look at rolling them out to at least June or July. There's a chance we climb up to a bounce off the 100 MA around 302. I don't see us getting higher than that, except in a fake-out. I'm light in a few June & July puts that I'm hanging onto for now, and will start opening further put positions either on Friday or early next week.

The Night Before Christmas on Wall Street

Twas the night before Christmas,  
and all on the floor,  
not a trader was trading,  
not a screen was a'glow.  


The stocks that I purchased,  
were in my brokerage, astray.   
In hopes that a good trade,  
soon would make gainz.  


In my penthouse apartment,  
on Fulton and John,   
I was laying with hos,  
who had nothing on.  


When outside my window,  
I heard a great sound!  
I prayed those SEC dicks,  
were nowhere to be found.  


I sprang from my bed,  
grabbed my gun, and walked slow,  
to see what was up.  
(This pissed off my ho).  


I could scarcely believe,  
what my eyes were seeing!  
It was a huge space yacht!  
I thought, ""I must be dreaming!""  


""I've always wanted one,  
to piss off my haters!  
And look!,"" I said,  
""It's pulled by eight traders!""  


Two teams of four traders,  
pulled the yacht through the sky.  
Then I noticed the driver,  
with a twinkle in his eye.  


His eyes were glazed over,  
his legs shook like jelly,  
and his 5 o'clock shadow,  
told me, it's Martin Shkreli!  


The yacht stopped at my penthouse,  
it was facing the train.  
St. Martin stood up,  
and called his traders by name.  


""On Madoff! On Friehling!  
On Lay and Skilling!  
On Belfort! On Fuld!  
On Lippmann and Keating!""  


""Pull to the window,  
I see and good boy,  
who's made the nice list!  
Let's give him some toys!""  


When under my tree,  
more presents appeared!  
My stocking was full!  
My hos shook in fear.  


I looked in his bag,  
and asked, ""What's the coal for?""  
""That's for Loretta Lynch,"" he said,  
""And Eric Holder.""  


""But you're a good trader,  
your gains my be slight,  
but you're yoloing the market,  
so I visit tonight.""  


""Christmas is about giving,  
about joy, love, and cheer,  
so fuck the SEC!  
And keep trading! Don't fear!""  


His yacht pulled away,  
my hos, they returned,  
but St. Martin was gone.  
He was not to be heard.  


But I heard him exclaim,  
as his yacht shone in the snow,  
""Happy Christmas to all,  
And to all a #YOLO

I've posted this for the last couple years. Merry Christmas degenerates.

Enjoy.

Harsh truth:

WSB Bears are not bears. Bears are talented investors who can find fundamental flaws in a business model or macroeconomic conditions that effect certain industries. They don’t rely on some blanket retail investor doom & gloom theory.

WSB bears are really sheep. Pushing their doomer narrative week after week in hopes of an economic world collapse to save their $3k in SPY puts.

These WSB Sheep push their doom & gloom narrative between work meetings on Zoom, about documents that were collaborated on and managed on Azure/AWS cloud space, while finishing out the day ordering Uber Eats from their local restaurant on an iPhone and watching The Big Short on repeat with their AirPods.

**Harsh truth:**

WSB Bears are not bears. Bears are talented investors who can find fundamental flaws in a business model or macroeconomic conditions that effect certain industries. They don’t rely on some blanket retail investor doom & gloom theory.

WSB bears are really sheep. Pushing their doomer narrative week after week in hopes of an economic world collapse to save their $3k in SPY puts.

These WSB Sheep push their doom & gloom narrative between work meetings on Zoom, about documents that were collaborated on and managed on Azure/AWS cloud space, while finishing out the day ordering Uber Eats from their local restaurant on an iPhone and watching The Big Short on repeat with their AirPods.

2020-04-26 21:19:41,libertyghost1,1,"NIO. Buying shares and options. Technical trade using the 4hr chart. Slow/fast stochastics both below 25. This is the last week before April sales report goes out (first week of May). Hefei deal could be announced any day.

Picked up long position Thursday, added on Friday. If it dips a little more, I’ll average down. Sell target will be when fast stochastic breaks 75. This trend has played very well: oversold slow stochastic ~> overbought fast stochastic. Nets avg of 8-10% gains every time played since October no matter the PPS with the exception of 1... when China shut everything down for over a month. Still held the pattern and lost 17% on that swing. That was 1/10 trades though, the rest averaged 8-10%, some trades took 3 days, others took 2 weeks. Point is, I’m ahead.

NIO has $$ trouble, but the first round of dilution won’t be until June at the earliest. Keeping my profits in play as to never miss the boat. When some see a stock struggling, I see a highly volition stock that has a predictable pattern. Lock away risk free shares for the long haul or cash out for quick trendies.

TL;DR:  NIO is oversold. Buy. It may dip more, so average down and scoop up more cheapies. If you wanna go options: NIO $5.00c/ 5-29. If you believe in the company like me, keep profits in play so you don’t miss your moms boat. We’re gonna check out Fiji this go ‘round."

GSK 5/15 $43c and MO 5/1 $41c. Nicotine plays. Will hold GSK past ER, will swing MO on pre-earnings run up one or two days. If ER for MO is solid and the uptrend continues I'll open 5/15 calls to capture the nicotine news.

NAT 5/15 $7c. CNBC bump isn't going to end on Monday. Swinging for a couple days.

XLE 5/1 $35c. Mnuchin said gov might take a stake in energy companies. The fund has 23.6% CVX and 23.02% XOM. Both have ER this week and could have short-term upside due to Mnuchin announcement.

XLF 5/15 $25c. Very cheap. Energy announcement is cross-bullish for financials.

XLK 5/1 $92c. Swinging one or two days. The fund holds 22.01% MSFT and 19.43% AAPL. Both have more room to run before ER.

I also hold SPY 5/15 $260p as a hedge. I'll be averaging down over the week if we see green."

So it's right that we have this logo, because the top voted loss porn of all time will be the US economy by Donald Trump

Edit: spelling"

I still feel that there’s a denial of reality including that fact that we’re going to have to re-engineer the service and travel industries from ground up. I’m holding cash until I see another leg down and real despair in the market. Wouldn’t be surprised if it takes months for that to happen."
