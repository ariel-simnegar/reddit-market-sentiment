2019-10-08 03:08:01,vanadios,6,"The closest we have been to a deal was the 11th round of talks in May. Everything was going well until Xi backed out at the last minute. After the talks, Liu He was attacked by the hawkish faction in the Central Committee that he conceded too much in the deal and his title of 'special envoy' was subsequently stripped. Xinhuanet listed three reasons for the Chinese side to back out: (1) the removal of all additional tariffs, (2) the volume of purchased goods, and (3) the balance of the wording of the text. No details about what 'wording' is problematic were provided, but CNBC said that the deal dictated the Chinese side to change its IP laws, which are attacked by the hawks as a violation of their sovereignty. 

Note that the main obstacle for the Chinese is NOT about changing the law: to make way for a deal, its congress already passed a new IP law in March 2019 to create a framework to address all US complaints about IP theft and explicitly bans forced technological transfer, the most important concern from the US side. (How they enforce it is another issue). The problem with the deal is with the 'wording', an issue raised again this afternoon by their representative. His comment also hinted that the Chinese are open to imposing further administrative regulations to address the issue.

The point is, the issue of IP might not be the biggest obstacle for trade talks this week. The Chinese may simply say: we will establish the new department of xxx and two new executive orders yyy to guarantee that issues zzz are strongly enforced, and that would be enough for Trump to save his face."

2019-10-07 23:15:37,SartorialNudist,17,"Try to do a repeat of today. Was one of those rare moments when I truly felt like I was feeling the market. Vigorously and sexually. Started the day with $SPY 10/7 $294 puts and 10/11 $230 $AAPL calls. Sold the puts about 15 minutes after the market opened for a little under 50% profit and bought 10/9 $SPY calls. Also loaded up on 10/11 $132 $DIS calls when it was in the red. Sold my $AAPL calls later in the day when it kept on floating around $230 for ~130% profit and switched to 10/11 222.5 puts. Sold those when they reached 70% profit. Also bought some 10/11 $265 $MA puts and 10/11 $86 $SBUX puts. Sold my $SPY calls when we got above 295 for about 60% profit and switched to 10/11 $293 $SPY puts. Sold those EOD for a hair under 115% profit. Kept the $DIS calls (up about 90%), $MA puts (up about 15%), and $SBUX puts (up a little under 35%). One of the handful of days where every position I entered made money. Ended the day with a little below 6.5k profit. 

I'm kind of scared of tomorrow cause while I was feeling the market, it was vigorously fucking the reward center of my brain. Can't even describe the elation. I was at work (which is why I think everything went as well as it did; I wasn't staring at charts 24/7, so I couldn't panic) and damn near every coworker commented on my happy mood. If tomorrow has the same amount of volatility, I'm really not sure I could do even half as well as I did today. I know I'm going to try though."
