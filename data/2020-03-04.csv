$Vanguard Total Institutional Bond Market Index

$JCBUX JPMorgan Bond R6

Now we just can't have the banks or government fail and we good... not sure what else to invest in that's an available options within my respective 401s

Sold all my puts today - no clue what happpens tomorrow and was thinking on taking a bearish position on basically any stock that bounces lol specifically a $SBUX $CCL $DAL

The volatility has me thinking the market doesn't quite know what to do yet, thus the bounces between highs and lows.

&#x200B;

Edit - I don't want to be a victim of a big boy shaking out retail - I'd like to try and position at the top or bottom of a channel, I did not have enough balls to buy puts today - despite the fact I think it will drop. I think big bois will draug it up like 3% before the drop. Let me also add that I am a complete retard and will likely lose my life savings in bond indexes somehow..."

If the market doesn’t do that today, I see Friday being a big sell day and we will test 2850 next week.  That’s why these huge moves upward are bad for long term recoveries. They lose momentum fast. Go up a lot, trade sideways, then back down even more.  You need gradual bottoming out to establish lows people are comfortable getting back in at."

\> Feds will continue to manipulate the market since the 401K's of the boomers are too big to fail. Regardless by friday the market will be 10% down from its peak last week.

\> COVID-19 infection >=1000 by Sunday of this week in USA; states now can do their own tests and CDC is once more keeping track of the number of positive tests. 

\> COVID-19 Vaccine and ant-viral Makers will get a big junk of the  8.3 billion dollar beervirus bill that went through congress on  March 4 2020. Expect to hear something from the president as early as Thursday but no later then sunday. Trump likes wins and giving these 4 top companies money can provide a vaccine quickly to keep America Great!. These companies may get as much as 2 billion between them. ($INO, $GILD, $MRNA)

\> two days ago I predicted 25-50 basis point cut and it was actually 50 basis points. This will do nothing. The market will continue to plunge despite the fake rise in indices today. The market will correct itself.

\> I expect some action from the ""Plunge Protection Team"" when the market drops 30% from the recent peak. I expect this to happen sometime in the next 3 weeks. At that time they may stop all trading. Check what happened in 2008. It will repeat.

\> So for us autists more puts!  (airlines, casinos, disney, hotels, etc) for more tendies!

\>As usual do your research!

2020-03-05 04:38:44,Harooooouuld,13,"One way to look at this fight between the Fed and Corona 

Another is a fight between boomers and everyone else

FED is trying to prop up stock market for millions of ignorant boomers who don't understand investing other than the automatic 401k deposits. As soon as you have the people who don't pay any attention ""calling their financial adviser"" it'll be full panic recession mode. Corona could literally do that with nationwide shutdowns.

And the FED literally made this their ""last line of defense"" if it breaks before the week ends, look out below. Plus, with FOMC meeting, market will be tanking at some point in advance of that as CV gets worse, in hopes they'll cut before March is over. 

Bull thesis is so much stronger once you just accept the fact that this event can't be curbed and fighting it only makes it worse down the road. Think of the months of green after we bottom out.

TL;DR: Boomers are at the ""Too Big to Fail"" point and the Fed is bailing them out. And they still may panic and sell."

Any reading between +5 and -5 is neutral, he explained, while any reading greater than five means sell and below negative five means buy. There is only one other reading on the oscillator that matters, however, and that's -12. 

>	The oscillator hit -12 after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and again at the end of 2016 and 2018 when the Fed took interest rates too far. During all of those times, a reading of -12 signaled the bottom. The only time -12 failed to be correct was in the middle of the financial crisis in 2008. Today is not 2008, Cramer said, adding there is no systemic risk to the markets. He said we will be getting a mild recession based on a lack of travel and entertainment -- so-called gatherings -- but the oscillator is saying the odds favor buying short-term -- and long-term, for that matter.

So Cramer relies on a magical oscillator to know if it’s time to buy or sell? What in the actual fuck?"

I’m guessing we’re astroturf green (i.e. fake green) rest of week and then flat or slight green next week simply because MM/PPT/Fed will try to allay CV fears in order to ease retail back into the market. They're not about to let this tank at the height of the virus panic. Therefore, a Friday EOD pump (or at the very minimum we end 'up' for the week vs. last week) to coax people into the weekend (and to purge put holders) would not surprise me at all. That plus the CDC no longer reporting infection number means we can gradually ""get back to regularly scheduled programming"". Maybe we touch ATH again within the next few weeks for the same reasons. Anyways, just plan around maximum fuckery for a while. I plan to be (mostly) cash through the weekend and keep an eye on things next week.

Longer term: I’ve got SPY puts for mid-May and TQQQ puts for late March. Whatever damage the virus is going to do will be fully realized by mid-May, and that could very well be nada (especially if we're suppressing numbers and only reporting senior deaths) so I'm ready to switch if necessary.

The slow relentless low volume grind up today was a  phsyop. Big boys loaded up puts on the closing green dildo after forcing retail to capitulate on their puts or FOMO into calls. 

Overnight futures will be a grind down leading us to a gap down open between -1% or -2% this will instantly lock in big gains for the big boys and retail will be FOMO'ing back into puts driving their profits higher. For those in retail who held puts they will finally be breaking even while the big boys are up big. They get big gains and they keep the little guys from winning it too big.

He moved to investment banking in 1984, and has since worked for several financial institutions. He briefly served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance under President George H. W.

Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

And on the pedestal, these words appear:

My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
