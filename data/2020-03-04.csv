$Vanguard Total Institutional Bond Market Index

$JCBUX JPMorgan Bond R6

Now we just can't have the banks or government fail and we good... not sure what else to invest in that's an available options within my respective 401s

Sold all my puts today - no clue what happpens tomorrow and was thinking on taking a bearish position on basically any stock that bounces lol specifically a $SBUX $CCL $DAL

The volatility has me thinking the market doesn't quite know what to do yet, thus the bounces between highs and lows.

&#x200B;

Edit - I don't want to be a victim of a big boy shaking out retail - I'd like to try and position at the top or bottom of a channel, I did not have enough balls to buy puts today - despite the fact I think it will drop. I think big bois will draug it up like 3% before the drop. Let me also add that I am a complete retard and will likely lose my life savings in bond indexes somehow..."
