I know I said this before but this is absolutely insane. 

Between a pandemic that basically crippled and is still crippling the US economy with each new report and metric released, renewed Trade War with China and the now nationwide civil unrest in which the President just invoked a 200 year old law to deploy US Troops on US Soil to crush the protests. 

And market is about to hit ATH.

Every excuse is a bunch of bullshit. Forward looking? The market is up from last week before the riots took place. Let me guess, markets creeping up on hopes of civil unrest ending, before markets even knew about the civil unrest. 

Now, what the hell happens to state deficits which are through the roof? Banks are rocketing. Are there suddenly no risk of defaults and foreclosures any more? PPP about to end leading to another round of layoffs. Priced in I'm assuming. Lets not mention overnight we went from social distancing to tens of thousands shoulder to shoulder protesting, looting and being shot at.

2020-06-02 05:59:21,KimJongUnsTrousers,9,"Closed my BABA calls today for a measly 20%. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act will pass the House this month. Baba is actually in a pretty good shape compared to other Chinese companies as they've said they are compliant with GAO, so of any Chinese company, Baba is the safest one to buy. I hate the political uncertainty though so I'm out for now.

For the other Chinese companies though like Bidu, their only avenue may be to delist and move to a secondary listing in HK. If they go that route, they will likely offer US holders the option to convert their shares to the HK shares. This is important because for a lot of large institutions and funds, by mandate they are not allowed to hold securities traded on a Chinese/HK/foreign exchanges. For example, a lot of mutual funds are only allowed to trade instruments on US exchanges (partly because they have expense caps tailored to their strategy or they might be USD only with no currency overlays).

The Tl;DR is, as soon as the bill passes, there will be a forced liquidation by these institutions/funds to bring their portfolio back in line with their investment mandate - some might have a quarter to do so and others might have to finish liquidating by month end, just depends on the institution but quarterly is the most common. So if you're long any of these Chinese companies, just make sure to hedge with some puts (end of June or early July expiration to cover when the bill passes). GL"

Is it to raise your chances of good things happening to you? Surely not, for society often mistakenly rewards the bad as much as the good. 

Is it a foolish attempt to chase immortality through memory and obituary? Surely not, for what do you remember of humanity's greatest and foundational minds? Those who built the aqueducts from nothing, the calculus/algebra on which all artificial intelligence is derived from, and pioneered agricultural infrastructure required for society to grow to its present point? 

No, you have forgotten or never cared to learn those names despite their fundamental brilliance and impact. So how can you hope to achieve immortality if they couldnt?

Be free, wsb. Think not of what others say to you nor how they will remember you. Search deep, find your true happiness, and carry it with you. For anyone who jeers at you is misguided and will kick and scream like a child when their time is up, never having found peace.

Three key ingredients to the rally since mid-March; 1) Liquidity by JPow 2) Bernie dropping out. 3) Virus ain't that bad.

Bernie dropping out was a key to the market's psychology for the rally--if Trump was gonna be president for another 4 years, then stocks look cheap now. Everyone knows that Bernie was the only real shot against Trump. Biden vs Trump is not a fair fight, Trump wins 10/10 times.

But these protests are going to make Trump look weak and pile more voters for Biden. Now this may not actually happen, but the if the market senses uncertainty about Trump's re-election chances, then you bet your ass we going down again.

TLDRL: SPY 290P 06/05 cause Trump cannot solve racism. And Sleepy Joe will benefit."

 But, my options account is retarded and bleeding cash.

Literally if I just bought options that matched my IRA plays, I'd be making a killing. But for some retarded-ass reason, I have this compulsion to make contrarian-ass option plays that rarely pan out. So, my two accounts are basically cancelling each other out.

Same as my daddy and his daddy before

You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here

He only came to town about twice a year

He'd buy 100 pound of grass seed and water lines

Everybody knew we bred the midget kind

Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad

He headed up the holler with everything he had

It's before my time but I've been told

He never came back from Midgetfarm Road

Now Daddy ran the midgets in a big block Dodge

Sold em at auction at the Mason's Lodge

Well him and my uncle tossed the midgets around

I still remember that rumblin' sound

Well the sheriff came around in the middle of the night

Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right

He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load

You could smell the herd burnin' down midgetfarm road"

These ideas are, nightmares to üêÉ parents

Whose worst fear is a child who shorts spy and likes earrings

Like whenever they talk their swearing

It's so scary in a house that allows, no üêªing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring

Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care

He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out

When he talks about, his 0 day spy poot time running out

Cause he hates J Pow so bad that he, blocks him out

If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out

His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back

Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap

Heard of george floyd and burned a taco shack

And broke into lowes , his house is a broken home

There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"

* CEO's been runnin around on CNBC and CNN talkin the company up bigly
* current share price is inexpensive, attracting buyers
* Disney has a 6% stake in company; George Soros, Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft are all investors in it.
* stonk market in general is doing good so DKNG is doing good.

After reading Princes of the Yen I realised that the FED might actually create a seriously fucked asset price bubble. Reserve requirements for banks are 10% (Edit: as of March 26th it's actually 0%) in the US currently which means that the $5-6tr the FED has printed will actually increase the money supply by many multiples of that if bank credit creation picks up. If non performing loans increase significantly people will just pump that money into real estate and the equity markets - and banks will take equities and real estate as loan collateral which will further exacerbate the bubble. Hopefully it doesn't happen or the US will be in serious shit. But if it does I got my calls ready.
