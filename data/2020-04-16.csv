Trump announced on the 14th that he‚Äôd be meeting with every big name in each sector of the economy via teleconference to devise a ‚Äúplan‚Äù from very ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people in how we‚Äôre going to open America again and sky rocket the v shape recovery. Every person and company he mentioned colluded and devised this plan. They knew that the only way the investors and even American people would back up the companies even in the MIDST of a pandemic is to use our FOMO THATS been bottled up and jerked around with every pump that the feds have thrown at the market since the crash. There is obviously no cure, you‚Äôre not retarded enough to believe that, which is why it brings the question of what the fuck is going on?? Is this real?? The answer is, it‚Äôs a complete fabricated attempt timed so perfectly with trumps reopening guidelines that he worked with the governors, also business men who have a lot lost a lot of money so far, and have so much to gain at everything being this low. Trump is a businessman, a piece of shit businessman, which makes him dangerous to the public. He and the other top 1% working together against natural orders and make the economy succumb to their will. That‚Äôs where Gilead comes into play. It is the ‚Äújustification‚Äù or the green light that we‚Äôve all anxiously been on the lookout for, because we knew it was coming one day and we were sure as hell not gonna miss out on it. Trump hates amazon, this is the second sign to my conspiracy. Amazon was not invited to the meeting and you can find out who else werent by seeing there stocks drop while every one else‚Äôs sky rockets. This is all I have so far, I don‚Äôt know what this means in the grand scheme of things tbh cause I‚Äôm still a peasant and learning how to put 2 and 2 together in a world full of manipulation and lies. But I truly believe that this is what‚Äôs causing all of this to happen. Complete fabrication, they sped up the recovery before its due time. We are not recovered as a country. If someone has further insight on what this could mean a year or two down the line for the economy if we don‚Äôt have a cure by then, which is what they‚Äôre banking on. They‚Äôre hoping we have a cure by then and the lives lost until then won‚Äôt mean shit to them. Leave any comments thanks.

TLDR: the 1% fabricating events to revive the market and gain more power than before. There is no cure. Just read it..."

The Federal Reserve [released the shocking details](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/) of what it has been up to in the past week. Its balance sheet has skyrocketed to $6.4 trillion.

One of the factors affecting this growth was a $26 billion jump (in total $378 billions) in the amount of its Central Bank Liquidity Swaps, where it provides dollars to foreign central banks in exchange for their local currency. During the last financial crisis, some of these dollar swaps were used to bail out global foreign banks that were in trouble. Given the current condition of numerous European banks, and their ties through derivatives to Wall Street‚Äôs mega banks, there is every reason to believe these dollar swaps are another thinly disguised bailout of a Frankenbank-financial system ‚Äì for the second time in 12 years."

READ FIRST

You guys have been giving me a really hard time lately. I have been sharing updates on recent Simpson mysteries of all varieties and I have been met with hatred, insults, character defamation, and I‚Äôm sick of it. I will not tolerate it anymore from this website.

I work really hard to provide accurate and important information to the general public, who doesn‚Äôt have access to the same vast resources as me.

I am sick and tired of the animosity and the evil of you people 


Tonight, I will be ending my own life.

The world is a sick place and you criminals helped me realize it.

. You drove me to this sick and twisted place. This is all your fault, that and I find it incredibly difficult to enjoy Simpson anymore given what I know about the show now 

I feel burdened by the weight of it

Simpson will never be the same

I hope you all know this lies on the shoulders of every single one of you

And Matt Groening, Touted creator of The Simpsons, may your soul burn in the depths of hell"

2020-04-17 07:57:16,pilotsepisode,-11,"Finally. We can all take a rest now. The Simpson theory has finally been confirmed

MAJOR UPDATE

Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Global markets are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.

Well, I bring good news.

In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.

The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.

This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA

In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....

Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....

Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason

I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy

The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù

The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.

They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....

But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.

America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.

I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it."

2020-04-17 07:05:10,Matt_Hunter_Hall,6,"I really think it is simply the zero interest rate environment combined with virtually no yield on bonds (unless they are corporate junk on the edge of default) that is fueling this. The money has to go somewhere; simply holding cash has a negative real yield.

Might as well pump it into equities; at least they pay a dividend are long term going up.

I mean buying long term treasuries seems more risky to me than buying stocks right now. If you buy some 30 year or even 10 year you take on massive interest rate risk. If rates go up in the next few years the value of those bonds is going to be cleaved; you may incur larger losses there than in stocks over the same time frame."

2020-04-17 06:12:33,pilotsepisode,-7,"Finally. We can all take a rest now. The Simpson theory has finally been confirmed

MAJOR UPDATE

Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Global markets are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.

Well, I bring good news.

In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.

The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.

This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA

In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....

Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....

Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason

I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy

The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù

The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.

They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....

But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.

America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.

I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it."

From Washington Post""

""In her letter, Sloan called particular attention to Adam Feuerstein, a biotech reporter whose relentlessly negative blog posts for thestreet.com this year have not only been filled with exaggeration, mischaracterization and half-truths, but curiously have also coincided with the spikes in short trading.
On March 11, for example, the day that German regulators announced their approval and Northwest Bio‚Äôs stock broke through $10, Feuerstein was quick to weigh in with a story that the company had withheld the news for two weeks to use it to divert attention from the fact that it had failed to deliver an interim report on the results of its Phase III trial back in the United States. As the chairman of the independent committee overseeing the trial later pointed out, there was no interim study and, by protocol, the company would have been prevented from seeing it even if there were one. As for that delay in getting out the good news, the company‚Äôs perfectly reasonable explanation was that it needed time to have the German notification translated into English and checked by the Germans.

The next month, on April 3, the headline on Feuerstein‚Äôs post was that Northwest Bio acknowledged that the FDA might throw out results of its Phase III study. It sounds pretty ominous. But all that really happened was that the company, in its annual report filed with the SEC, included that possibility in the long list of risks that investors should take into consideration, just as any company in the midst of a Phase III trial would have to do."""

Having a volatile move one way or another does not mean a trend has been established. It is probably true that the Fed can postpone, by inflating our already-metastasizing National,  from a reckoning that is probably inevitable, for some time longer. 

But much of our former economy is just not coming back. And the team in charge of the transition to whatever the next stage is narrow, defensive, anti-government and anti-intellectual at a time when we need the highest quality and noble-minded government can find to sort out all the cross-currents. We need a visionary like JFK  and instead have an empty suit like Trump--We need a wonk like Robert Oppenheimer and we have a hayseed like Mike Pence."

They also get special privileges. At least one of them being naked shorts are available, with a 13 day settlement period (I might have the details incorrect). So that they can take the other side of trades people want to make, without necessarily the requirement to locate shares first when they're taking the short side of a trade (every trade has a buyer and seller).

The market makers aren't moving the market as much as you think. It's hedge funds, but they aren't very well coordinated since there's hundreds of them."

Every other post here was a FXI put holder complaining about the most manipulated market in the world and fuck CCP. Every response was - don't bet against the CCP, supply and lock-downs don't matter, brrrrrr.

my thinking says that we will have a selloff at open for people paperhands when bull like me, but then get the fomo dip from people who were like zomg 10 pts gotta get in.  so i could also try to sell at the top of that one.  the i think we crash down to around 280-282 and who knows what happens after that. 

this is based entirely on my made up TA, but whatever level seems to stick i don't think we break past it. at least not until next week.

ALSO, if u recall how we got fucked at the bottom it was something similar.  like a huge limit down that drew everyone in, then literally reversed midday and never came back.  everyone still thinks ""eod moves""."

The stock market will continue being a casino until the moment that funding pressures start exploding around the world again and the dollar moves up hard. Then it will act as the wrecking ball that it is and everything will starting crashing again while people around the world are firesaling assets to raise desperately needed dollars. 

The dollar shortage is really all that matters right now. It came to a head in mid March and the crash actually let some steam off but the problem is still there and building again in the background. 

Have you wondered why the DXY is hanging around 100 when the Fed is committed to unlimited QE? By conventional wisdom that should be extremely bearish for the $ but it‚Äôs not because QE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. It does nothing to provide dollar liquidity to the places it‚Äôs actually needed around the world. Swap lines are marginally more effective but the same problem exists. In order for the dollars to get into the system the primary dealers need to lend them out but they don‚Äôt want to because they don‚Äôt trust the shitty collateral everyone has to offer so they hoard them instead.
The only collateral they will take is the safest possible which is namely t-bills. That‚Äôs why every time we saw a limit down stock futures, t-bill yields had led the way down. People were selling everything they could in order to raise dollars to get their hands on t-bills."

Do not understand the reasons market going crazy

Few days back a Trump said he had total authority to reopen economy

Now today

Trump just provided vague guidelines and leaving Governors to take decision to open economy

22 millions lost jobs and many more millions coming in next few weeks

China GDP shrank 6.5%

Whatever lUS companies lost Revenue during these months are gone

US companies when open will still be working at lower capacity due to to lower demand in next couple of quarters 

Europe and most Asian countries are stilll closed

US GDP will be huge contraction both in q1 and Q2 

Stocks are ultimately driven by earnings

Earning will be very bad for Q1 and thru 3020 and for 2021 too

Relation with China going to go worse due to trade deal and other issues

This market is on ventilator developed by Trump named Fed only for intermediate phase from closure to reopen

Once this support is removed

Market will crash again virus will come back in fall as communicated by Trump 

Earning will be bad

Debt of 8-9 trillion will be further increased by couple of trillion for infrastructure and additional bailouts

US going to lose AAA rating

IMF already said its global and deep recession

Market is going to come down in coming months

2020-04-17 03:33:17,LongDickLeukemia,3,"I'm pretty dumb, and I don't have any money riding on this, but my prediction is this: 

With the news of the economy reopening soon, MMs are gonna be happy because businesses are going to start making money again. However, they aren't going to just buy it hook-line-sinker, it's just going to be a slow climb. And, as we've been told, the reopening process is going to be a gradual transition, not a light switch back to 100%, so there's another reason the spy isn't gonna hit ATH any time soon. 

The gradual reopening is going to end up hurting Q3 and Q4 earnings, maybe even through next year if we get another wave. This is when MMs will realize that this whole shitstorm had a bigger effect on the economy than they expected. I don't think we will see another circuit breaker any time soon, but there's gonna be some sort of correction as more and more companies that get reopened miss earnings or begin to report much lower earnings.


I don't think SPY is gonna make many more massive one-day or one-week swings this year, but it's definitely going above 300 by EOY at this rate, maybe even in the next few weeks since it seems to wanna get there soon."

>In a statement after its shares lept, Gilead urged caution.¬†‚ÄúWe understand the urgent need for a Covid-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir. The totality of the data need to be analysed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial,‚Äù it said.

>‚ÄúAnecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19. We expect the data from our Phase 3 study in patients with severe Covid-19 infection to be available at the end of this month, and additional data from other studies to become available in May.‚Äù

>Umer Raffat, a biotech analyst at Evercore, said that he was ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù about remdesivir but warned it was not a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù.

>He said it was important to note that none of the patients on the Chicago trial had been on invasive ventilation, which tends to be an indication of a more serious condition and worse outcomes.¬†

Bankruptcies and distressed companies could give Amazon the opportunity to expand its retail footprint in ways that it could only dream of before as its Whole Foods acquisition. This could set the tone for an even bigger retail expansion in the coming years that could help drive additional increases in future revenues for the company as year-over-year (Y/Y) sales look to possibly astound. 
Amazon has done a phenomenal job changing and adapting to the times and creating opportunity when other companies hesitate. While most companies and economies are reeling from coronavirus, Amazon is hiring like it is the holiday season with a possible sales explosion that could help the market rerate its stock. Amazon's success with its Whole Foods acquisition, along with a potential future expansion of Go stores, could mean a rapid retail expansion for Amazon across the globe as bankruptcies could abound in the wake of coronavirus. My Amazon position has grown from a formerly small position at the beginning of the year into one of my largest individual stock holdings. Best of luck to all.

I think we need an options strategy that works for autists that don't have big boi bucks in their account yet (like me, don't judge). I call it the long FD spread. Not to be cofused with actual spreads, this spread has no short legs. Basically, you assume the market is going to be irrational as fuck, split half of your investment up into two long legs. One leg will be FD puts (0.01 in premium) and one long leg will be FD calls (0.01 in premiums) in equal amounts. You sell all contracts 1 to 2 days out, or whenever the premiums on one of your legs is 0.03 or higher. I'm going to be taking $20 worth next week and playing this retarded strat and let you know how it goes. Probably poorly, but whatever.

Edit: I'm sure this probably isn't an original idea, and there's probably an options strategy that has a name with the same setup that I don't know yet. I only know credit and debits spreads and iron condor.

I saw such strong price/action at end of day and such positive inflows that hard for me to believe that this would take a beating based on economy opening up. This stock should have already been at these levels after Q1 earnings beat. Thanks to those who said to me that they see AH fade and Premkt pump often in $AMZN

- Boeing is resuming production 4/20, but no one is buying planes right now

MAJOR UPDATE

Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.

But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Global markets are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.

Well, I bring good news.

In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.

The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.

This was found by a viewer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA

In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....

Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....

Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason 

I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto
Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy 

The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence. 

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù

The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.

They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....

But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.

America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.

I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go
Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it."

Even when we got successful treatments for AIDS, we didn't all just start having unprotected sex with HIV positive people. I don't think it's a good option to open up the economy, have everyone get the virus, then just treat the whole population with this drug.

**Purchased 50 call options on $MSFT with a strike price of $130 expiration 3/19/2021** on 02/28/2020 üí≤


**Purchased 40 call options of $GOOGL with a strike price of $1200 and expiration 6/18/2021** on 02/27/2020 üí≤

**Purchased 10,000 shares of WORK** on 02/27/2020 üí≤

What are Pelosi earnings on $NFLX calls she purchased in July 2019?

**Purchased 30 call options of $NFLX with a strike of $250 expiration 6/19/20** in July 2019 üí≤

She paid 146 for each of those contracts which is $438,000. As of today they sell for around 200 each its worth roughly $600,000 (will go up even more tomorrow)

She was down on this play most of the year, Corona literally saved those NFLX calls.

2020-04-16 21:43:28,anterionerion,5,"For everyone who has been saying AMZN is ATH so it can't keep going up pay attention

ATH is the most bullish price for any stock to be at. This is contrary to conventional wisdom that tells you to be scared of buying ATH but conventional wisdom is mostly wrong. ATH is a signal of strength. Every stock that ever goes anywhere has to make new ATH at some point and you want to be there when it does. That's why you should never be scared of buying at ATH. It's the same for stocks that make all time lows, Never too high to buy, never too low to sell, remember that.

I said as much last October when AAPL broke new highs at 230, every bear on WSB discord called me crazy but AAPL continued its run up to 330. AAPL calls made a fortune and all the small money idiots who tried to short because ""muh overvalued muh pullback muh trade war"" got destroyed."

At any other given time, ""trimming the fat"" is seen as a positive thing. Companies downsize all the time to realize more operational efficiencies and that's just happening now at a larger scale. Company cuts job, stonk goes up because hey, trimmed fat.

The only thing people care about is revenues - and the stimulus checks will help prop that up somewhat. So much of revenues these days is B2B and not dependent on consumer spending. The megacorps are doing just fine right now.

I say this as someone holding SPY 7/17 200p contracts because I'm autistic as fuck and have been pouring through data for the first time in my life to try and find out how I can still be right and have turned up empty handed.
