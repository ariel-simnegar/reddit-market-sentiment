Trump announced on the 14th that he‚Äôd be meeting with every big name in each sector of the economy via teleconference to devise a ‚Äúplan‚Äù from very ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people in how we‚Äôre going to open America again and sky rocket the v shape recovery. Every person and company he mentioned colluded and devised this plan. They knew that the only way the investors and even American people would back up the companies even in the MIDST of a pandemic is to use our FOMO THATS been bottled up and jerked around with every pump that the feds have thrown at the market since the crash. There is obviously no cure, you‚Äôre not retarded enough to believe that, which is why it brings the question of what the fuck is going on?? Is this real?? The answer is, it‚Äôs a complete fabricated attempt timed so perfectly with trumps reopening guidelines that he worked with the governors, also business men who have a lot lost a lot of money so far, and have so much to gain at everything being this low. Trump is a businessman, a piece of shit businessman, which makes him dangerous to the public. He and the other top 1% working together against natural orders and make the economy succumb to their will. That‚Äôs where Gilead comes into play. It is the ‚Äújustification‚Äù or the green light that we‚Äôve all anxiously been on the lookout for, because we knew it was coming one day and we were sure as hell not gonna miss out on it. Trump hates amazon, this is the second sign to my conspiracy. Amazon was not invited to the meeting and you can find out who else werent by seeing there stocks drop while every one else‚Äôs sky rockets. This is all I have so far, I don‚Äôt know what this means in the grand scheme of things tbh cause I‚Äôm still a peasant and learning how to put 2 and 2 together in a world full of manipulation and lies. But I truly believe that this is what‚Äôs causing all of this to happen. Complete fabrication, they sped up the recovery before its due time. We are not recovered as a country. If someone has further insight on what this could mean a year or two down the line for the economy if we don‚Äôt have a cure by then, which is what they‚Äôre banking on. They‚Äôre hoping we have a cure by then and the lives lost until then won‚Äôt mean shit to them. Leave any comments thanks.

TLDR: the 1% fabricating events to revive the market and gain more power than before. There is no cure. Just read it..."
